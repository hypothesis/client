      <h2>PART ONE</h2>

      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>

      <p>
        Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own
        way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys&rsquo; house. The wife had
        discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French
        girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she had announced to
        her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him.
        This position of affairs had now lasted three days, and not only the
        husband and wife themselves, but all the members of their family and
        household, were painfully conscious of it. Every person in the house
        felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that the
        stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common
        with one another than they, the members of the family and household of
        the Oblonskys. The wife did not leave her own room, the husband had not
        been at home for three days. The children ran wild all over the house;
        the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper, and wrote to a
        friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her; the man-cook
        had walked off the day before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and
        the coachman had given warning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Three days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch
        Oblonsky&mdash;Stiva, as he was called in the fashionable
        world&mdash;woke up at his usual hour, that is, at eight o&rsquo;clock
        in the morning, not in his wife&rsquo;s bedroom, but on the
        leather-covered sofa in his study. He turned over his stout,
        well-cared-for person on the springy sofa, as though he would sink into
        a long sleep again; he vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side
        and buried his face in it; but all at once he jumped up, sat up on the
        sofa, and opened his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, how was it now?&rdquo; he thought, going over his
        dream. &ldquo;Now, how was it? To be sure! Alabin was giving a dinner at
        Darmstadt; no, not Darmstadt, but something American. Yes, but then,
        Darmstadt was in America. Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner on glass
        tables, and the tables sang,
        <i>Il mio tesoro</i>&mdash;not <i>Il mio tesoro</i> though, but
        something better, and there were some sort of little decanters on the
        table, and they were women, too,&rdquo; he remembered.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s eyes twinkled gaily, and he pondered with a
        smile. &ldquo;Yes, it was nice, very nice. There was a great deal more
        that was delightful, only there&rsquo;s no putting it into words, or
        even expressing it in one&rsquo;s thoughts awake.&rdquo; And noticing a
        gleam of light peeping in beside one of the serge curtains, he
        cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge of the sofa, and felt about
        with them for his slippers, a present on his last birthday, worked for
        him by his wife on gold-colored morocco. And, as he had done every day
        for the last nine years, he stretched out his hand, without getting up,
        towards the place where his dressing-gown always hung in his bedroom.
        And thereupon he suddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his
        wife&rsquo;s room, but in his study, and why: the smile vanished from
        his face, he knitted his brows.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, ah, ah! Oo!...&rdquo; he muttered, recalling everything that
        had happened. And again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was
        present to his imagination, all the hopelessness of his position, and
        worst of all, his own fault.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, she won&rsquo;t forgive me, and she can&rsquo;t forgive me.
        And the most awful thing about it is that it&rsquo;s all my
        fault&mdash;all my fault, though I&rsquo;m not to blame. That&rsquo;s
        the point of the whole situation,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Oh, oh,
        oh!&rdquo; he kept repeating in despair, as he remembered the acutely
        painful sensations caused him by this quarrel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming, happy and
        good-humored, from the theater, with a huge pear in his hand for his
        wife, he had not found his wife in the drawing-room, to his surprise had
        not found her in the study either, and saw her at last in her bedroom
        with the unlucky letter that revealed everything in her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        She, his Dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household details, and
        limited in her ideas, as he considered, was sitting perfectly still with
        the letter in her hand, looking at him with an expression of horror,
        despair, and indignation.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? this?&rdquo; she asked, pointing to the
        letter.
      </p>

      <p>
        And at this recollection, Stepan Arkadyevitch, as is so often the case,
        was not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he had
        met his wife&rsquo;s words.
      </p>

      <p>
        There happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when
        they are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful. He did not
        succeed in adapting his face to the position in which he was placed
        towards his wife by the discovery of his fault. Instead of being hurt,
        denying, defending himself, begging forgiveness, instead of remaining
        indifferent even&mdash;anything would have been better than what he did
        do&mdash;his face utterly involuntarily (reflex spinal action, reflected
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was fond of physiology)&mdash;utterly
        involuntarily assumed its habitual, good-humored, and therefore idiotic
        smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        This idiotic smile he could not forgive himself. Catching sight of that
        smile, Dolly shuddered as though at physical pain, broke out with her
        characteristic heat into a flood of cruel words, and rushed out of the
        room. Since then she had refused to see her husband.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that idiotic smile that&rsquo;s to blame for it
        all,&rdquo; thought Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s to be done? What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; he
        said to himself in despair, and found no answer.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his relations with himself. He
        was incapable of deceiving himself and persuading himself that he
        repented of his conduct. He could not at this date repent of the fact
        that he, a handsome, susceptible man of thirty-four, was not in love
        with his wife, the mother of five living and two dead children, and only
        a year younger than himself. All he repented of was that he had not
        succeeded better in hiding it from his wife. But he felt all the
        difficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife, his children, and
        himself. Possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better from
        his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would have had
        such an effect on her. He had never clearly thought out the subject, but
        he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him
        of being unfaithful to her, and shut her eyes to the fact. He had even
        supposed that she, a worn-out woman no longer young or good-looking, and
        in no way remarkable or interesting, merely a good mother, ought from a
        sense of fairness to take an indulgent view. It had turned out quite the
        other way.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s awful! oh dear, oh dear! awful!&rdquo; Stepan
        Arkadyevitch kept repeating to himself, and he could think of nothing to
        be done. &ldquo;And how well things were going up till now! how well we
        got on! She was contented and happy in her children; I never interfered
        with her in anything; I let her manage the children and the house just
        as she liked. It&rsquo;s true it&rsquo;s bad <i>her</i> having been a
        governess in our house. That&rsquo;s bad! There&rsquo;s something
        common, vulgar, in flirting with one&rsquo;s governess. But what a
        governess!&rdquo; (He vividly recalled the roguish black eyes of Mlle.
        Roland and her smile.) &ldquo;But after all, while she was in the house,
        I kept myself in hand. And the worst of it all is that she&rsquo;s
        already ... it seems as if ill-luck would have it so! Oh, oh! But what,
        what is to be done?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        There was no solution, but that universal solution which life gives to
        all questions, even the most complex and insoluble. That answer is: one
        must live in the needs of the day&mdash;that is, forget oneself. To
        forget himself in sleep was impossible now, at least till nighttime; he
        could not go back now to the music sung by the decanter-women; so he
        must forget himself in the dream of daily life.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then we shall see,&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch said to himself,
        and getting up he put on a gray dressing-gown lined with blue silk, tied
        the tassels in a knot, and, drawing a deep breath of air into his broad,
        bare chest, he walked to the window with his usual confident step,
        turning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily. He pulled up
        the blind and rang the bell loudly. It was at once answered by the
        appearance of an old friend, his valet, Matvey, carrying his clothes,
        his boots, and a telegram. Matvey was followed by the barber with all
        the necessaries for shaving.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Are there any papers from the office?&rdquo; asked Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, taking the telegram and seating himself at the
        looking-glass.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;On the table,&rdquo; replied Matvey, glancing with inquiring
        sympathy at his master; and, after a short pause, he added with a sly
        smile, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve sent from the carriage-jobbers.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch made no reply, he merely glanced at Matvey in the
        looking-glass. In the glance, in which their eyes met in the
        looking-glass, it was clear that they understood one another. Stepan
        Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s eyes asked: &ldquo;Why do you tell me that?
        don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Matvey put his hands in his jacket pockets, thrust out one leg, and
        gazed silently, good-humoredly, with a faint smile, at his master.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I told them to come on Sunday, and till then not to trouble you
        or themselves for nothing,&rdquo; he said. He had obviously prepared the
        sentence beforehand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch saw Matvey wanted to make a joke and attract
        attention to himself. Tearing open the telegram, he read it through,
        guessing at the words, misspelt as they always are in telegrams, and his
        face brightened.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Matvey, my sister Anna Arkadyevna will be here tomorrow,&rdquo;
        he said, checking for a minute the sleek, plump hand of the barber,
        cutting a pink path through his long, curly whiskers.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; said Matvey, showing by this response that he,
        like his master, realized the significance of this arrival&mdash;that
        is, that Anna Arkadyevna, the sister he was so fond of, might bring
        about a reconciliation between husband and wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alone, or with her husband?&rdquo; inquired Matvey.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch could not answer, as the barber was at work on his
        upper lip, and he raised one finger. Matvey nodded at the looking-glass.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alone. Is the room to be got ready upstairs?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Inform Darya Alexandrovna: where she orders.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Darya Alexandrovna?&rdquo; Matvey repeated, as though in doubt.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, inform her. Here, take the telegram; give it to her, and
        then do what she tells you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You want to try it on,&rdquo; Matvey understood, but he only
        said, &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be
        dressed, when Matvey, stepping deliberately in his creaky boots, came
        back into the room with the telegram in his hand. The barber had gone.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Darya Alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away.
        Let him do&mdash;that is you&mdash;as he likes,&rdquo; he said, laughing
        only with his eyes, and putting his hands in his pockets, he watched his
        master with his head on one side. Stepan Arkadyevitch was silent a
        minute. Then a good-humored and rather pitiful smile showed itself on
        his handsome face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Eh, Matvey?&rdquo; he said, shaking his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, sir; she will come round,&rdquo; said
        Matvey.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come round?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you think so? Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; asked Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, hearing the rustle of a woman&rsquo;s dress at the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s I,&rdquo; said a firm, pleasant, woman&rsquo;s voice,
        and the stern, pockmarked face of Matrona Philimonovna, the nurse, was
        thrust in at the doorway.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what is it, Matrona?&rdquo; queried Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        going up to her at the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although Stepan Arkadyevitch was completely in the wrong as regards his
        wife, and was conscious of this himself, almost everyone in the house
        (even the nurse, Darya Alexandrovna&rsquo;s chief ally) was on his side.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what now?&rdquo; he asked disconsolately.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Go to her, sir; own your fault again. Maybe God will aid you. She
        is suffering so, it&rsquo;s sad to see her; and besides, everything in
        the house is topsy-turvy. You must have pity, sir, on the children. Beg
        her forgiveness, sir. There&rsquo;s no help for it! One must take the
        consequences....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But she won&rsquo;t see me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You do your part. God is merciful; pray to God, sir, pray to
        God.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, that&rsquo;ll do, you can go,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, blushing suddenly. &ldquo;Well now, do dress me.&rdquo; He
        turned to Matvey and threw off his dressing-gown decisively.
      </p>

      <p>
        Matvey was already holding up the shirt like a horse&rsquo;s collar,
        and, blowing off some invisible speck, he slipped it with obvious
        pleasure over the well-groomed body of his master.
      </p>

        When he was dressed, Stepan Arkadyevitch sprinkled some scent on
        himself, pulled down his shirt-cuffs, distributed into his pockets his
        cigarettes, pocketbook, matches, and watch with its double chain and
        seals, and shaking out his handkerchief, feeling himself clean,
        fragrant, healthy, and physically at ease, in spite of his unhappiness,
        he walked with a slight swing on each leg into the dining-room, where
        coffee was already waiting for him, and beside the coffee, letters and
        papers from the office.
      </p>

      <p>
        He read the letters. One was very unpleasant, from a merchant who was
        buying a forest on his wife&rsquo;s property. To sell this forest was
        absolutely essential; but at present, until he was reconciled with his
        wife, the subject could not be discussed. The most unpleasant thing of
        all was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the
        question of his reconciliation with his wife. And the idea that he might
        be led on by his interests, that he might seek a reconciliation with his
        wife on account of the sale of the forest&mdash;that idea hurt him.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he had finished his letters, Stepan Arkadyevitch moved the
        office-papers close to him, rapidly looked through two pieces of
        business, made a few notes with a big pencil, and pushing away the
        papers, turned to his coffee. As he sipped his coffee, he opened a still
        damp morning paper, and began reading it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper, not an extreme
        one, but one advocating the views held by the majority. And in spite of
        the fact that science, art, and politics had no special interest for
        him, he firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held by
        the majority and by his paper, and he only changed them when the
        majority changed them&mdash;or, more strictly speaking, he did not
        change them, but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views;
        these political opinions and views had come to him of themselves, just
        as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat, but simply took
        those that were being worn. And for him, living in a certain
        society&mdash;owing to the need, ordinarily developed at years of
        discretion, for some degree of mental activity&mdash;to have views was
        just as indispensable as to have a hat. If there was a reason for his
        preferring liberal to conservative views, which were held also by many
        of his circle, it arose not from his considering liberalism more
        rational, but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of
        life. The liberal party said that in Russia everything is wrong, and
        certainly Stepan Arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly short of
        money. The liberal party said that marriage is an institution quite out
        of date, and that it needs reconstruction; and family life certainly
        afforded Stepan Arkadyevitch little gratification, and forced him into
        lying and hypocrisy, which was so repulsive to his nature. The liberal
        party said, or rather allowed it to be understood, that religion is only
        a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people; and Stepan
        Arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without his legs
        aching from standing up, and could never make out what was the object of
        all the terrible and high-flown language about another world when life
        might be so very amusing in this world. And with all this, Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, who liked a joke, was fond of puzzling a plain man by
        saying that if he prided himself on his origin, he ought not to stop at
        Rurik and disown the first founder of his family&mdash;the monkey. And
        so Liberalism had become a habit of Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s, and he
        liked his newspaper, as he did his cigar after dinner, for the slight
        fog it diffused in his brain. He read the leading article, in which it
        was maintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry
        that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative elements,
        and that the government ought to take measures to crush the
        revolutionary hydra; that, on the contrary, &ldquo;in our opinion the
        danger lies not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra, but in the
        obstinacy of traditionalism clogging progress,&rdquo; etc., etc. He read
        another article, too, a financial one, which alluded to Bentham and
        Mill, and dropped some innuendoes reflecting on the ministry. With his
        characteristic quickwittedness he caught the drift of each innuendo,
        divined whence it came, at whom and on what ground it was aimed, and
        that afforded him, as it always did, a certain satisfaction. But today
        that satisfaction was embittered by Matrona Philimonovna&rsquo;s advice
        and the unsatisfactory state of the household. He read, too, that Count
        Beist was rumored to have left for Wiesbaden, and that one need have no
        more gray hair, and of the sale of a light carriage, and of a young
        person seeking a situation; but these items of information did not give
        him, as usual, a quiet, ironical gratification. Having finished the
        paper, a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter, he got up, shaking
        the crumbs of the roll off his waistcoat; and, squaring his broad chest,
        he smiled joyously: not because there was anything particularly
        agreeable in his mind&mdash;the joyous smile was evoked by a good
        digestion.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him, and he grew
        thoughtful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two childish voices (Stepan Arkadyevitch recognized the voices of
        Grisha, his youngest boy, and Tanya, his eldest girl) were heard outside
        the door. They were carrying something, and dropped it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I told you not to sit passengers on the roof,&rdquo; said the
        little girl in English; &ldquo;there, pick them up!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s in confusion,&rdquo; thought Stepan
        Arkadyevitch; &ldquo;there are the children running about by
        themselves.&rdquo; And going to the door, he called them. They threw
        down the box, that represented a train, and came in to their father.
      </p>

      <p>
        The little girl, her father&rsquo;s favorite, ran up boldly, embraced
        him, and hung laughingly on his neck, enjoying as she always did the
        smell of scent that came from his whiskers. At last the little girl
        kissed his face, which was flushed from his stooping posture and beaming
        with tenderness, loosed her hands, and was about to run away again; but
        her father held her back.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How is mamma?&rdquo; he asked, passing his hand over his
        daughter&rsquo;s smooth, soft little neck. &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo;
        he said, smiling to the boy, who had come up to greet him. He was
        conscious that he loved the boy less, and always tried to be fair; but
        the boy felt it, and did not respond with a smile to his father&rsquo;s
        chilly smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mamma? She is up,&rdquo; answered the girl.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed. &ldquo;That means that she&rsquo;s not slept
        again all night,&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, is she cheerful?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and
        mother, and that her mother could not be cheerful, and that her father
        must be aware of this, and that he was pretending when he asked about it
        so lightly. And she blushed for her father. He at once perceived it, and
        blushed too.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She did not say we
        must do our lessons, but she said we were to go for a walk with Miss
        Hoole to grandmamma&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, go, Tanya, my darling. Oh, wait a minute, though,&rdquo; he
        said, still holding her and stroking her soft little hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took off the mantelpiece, where he had put it yesterday, a little box
        of sweets, and gave her two, picking out her favorites, a chocolate and
        a fondant.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For Grisha?&rdquo; said the little girl, pointing to the
        chocolate.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo; And still stroking her little shoulder, he
        kissed her on the roots of her hair and neck, and let her go.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The carriage is ready,&rdquo; said Matvey; &ldquo;but
        there&rsquo;s someone to see you with a petition.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Been here long?&rdquo; asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Half an hour.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How many times have I told you to tell me at once?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;One must let you drink your coffee in peace, at least,&rdquo;
        said Matvey, in the affectionately gruff tone with which it was
        impossible to be angry.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, show the person up at once,&rdquo; said Oblonsky, frowning
        with vexation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The petitioner, the widow of a staff captain Kalinin, came with a
        request impossible and unreasonable; but Stepan Arkadyevitch, as he
        generally did, made her sit down, heard her to the end attentively
        without interrupting her, and gave her detailed advice as to how and to
        whom to apply, and even wrote her, in his large, sprawling, good and
        legible hand, a confident and fluent little note to a personage who
        might be of use to her. Having got rid of the staff captain&rsquo;s
        widow, Stepan Arkadyevitch took his hat and stopped to recollect whether
        he had forgotten anything. It appeared that he had forgotten nothing
        except what he wanted to forget&mdash;his wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; He bowed his head, and his handsome face assumed
        a harassed expression. &ldquo;To go, or not to go!&rdquo; he said to
        himself; and an inner voice told him he must not go, that nothing could
        come of it but falsity; that to amend, to set right their relations was
        impossible, because it was impossible to make her attractive again and
        able to inspire love, or to make him an old man, not susceptible to
        love. Except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now; and deceit
        and lying were opposed to his nature.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It must be some time, though: it can&rsquo;t go on like
        this,&rdquo; he said, trying to give himself courage. He squared his
        chest, took out a cigarette, took two whiffs at it, flung it into a
        mother-of-pearl ashtray, and with rapid steps walked through the
        drawing-room, and opened the other door into his wife&rsquo;s bedroom.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 4</h3>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna, in a dressing jacket, and with her now scanty, once
        luxuriant and beautiful hair fastened up with hairpins on the nape of
        her neck, with a sunken, thin face and large, startled eyes, which
        looked prominent from the thinness of her face, was standing among a
        litter of all sorts of things scattered all over the room, before an
        open bureau, from which she was taking something. Hearing her
        husband&rsquo;s steps, she stopped, looking towards the door, and trying
        assiduously to give her features a severe and contemptuous expression.
        She felt she was afraid of him, and afraid of the coming interview. She
        was just attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already
        in these last three days&mdash;to sort out the children&rsquo;s things
        and her own, so as to take them to her mother&rsquo;s&mdash;and again
        she could not bring herself to do this; but now again, as each time
        before, she kept saying to herself, &ldquo;that things cannot go on like
        this, that she must take some step&rdquo; to punish him, put him to
        shame, avenge on him some little part at least of the suffering he had
        caused her. She still continued to tell herself that she should leave
        him, but she was conscious that this was impossible; it was impossible
        because she could not get out of the habit of regarding him as her
        husband and loving him. Besides this, she realized that if even here in
        her own house she could hardly manage to look after her five children
        properly, they would be still worse off where she was going with them
        all. As it was, even in the course of these three days, the youngest was
        unwell from being given unwholesome soup, and the others had almost gone
        without their dinner the day before. She was conscious that it was
        impossible to go away; but, cheating herself, she went on all the same
        sorting out her things and pretending she was going.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seeing her husband, she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau
        as though looking for something, and only looked round at him when he
        had come quite up to her. But her face, to which she tried to give a
        severe and resolute expression, betrayed bewilderment and suffering.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dolly!&rdquo; he said in a subdued and timid voice. He bent his
        head towards his shoulder and tried to look pitiful and humble, but for
        all that he was radiant with freshness and health. In a rapid glance she
        scanned his figure that beamed with health and freshness. &ldquo;Yes, he
        is happy and content!&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;while I.... And that
        disgusting good nature, which everyone likes him for and praises&mdash;I
        hate that good nature of his,&rdquo; she thought. Her mouth stiffened,
        the muscles of the cheek contracted on the right side of her pale,
        nervous face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she said in a rapid, deep, unnatural
        voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dolly!&rdquo; he repeated, with a quiver in his voice.
        &ldquo;Anna is coming today.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what is that to me? I can&rsquo;t see her!&rdquo; she
        cried.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you must, really, Dolly....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Go away, go away, go away!&rdquo; she shrieked, not looking at
        him, as though this shriek were called up by physical pain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch could be calm when he thought of his wife, he could
        hope that she would <i>come round</i>, as Matvey expressed it, and could
        quietly go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee; but when he saw
        her tortured, suffering face, heard the tone of her voice, submissive to
        fate and full of despair, there was a catch in his breath and a lump in
        his throat, and his eyes began to shine with tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My God! what have I done? Dolly! For God&rsquo;s sake!... You
        know....&rdquo; He could not go on; there was a sob in his throat.
      </p>

      <p>
        She shut the bureau with a slam, and glanced at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dolly, what can I say?... One thing: forgive.... Remember, cannot
        nine years of my life atone for an instant....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She dropped her eyes and listened, expecting what he would say, as it
        were beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe
        differently.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;&mdash;instant of passion?&rdquo; he said, and would have gone
        on, but at that word, as at a pang of physical pain, her lips stiffened
        again, and again the muscles of her right cheek worked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Go away, go out of the room!&rdquo; she shrieked still more
        shrilly, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t talk to me of your passion and your
        loathsomeness.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She tried to go out, but tottered, and clung to the back of a chair to
        support herself. His face relaxed, his lips swelled, his eyes were
        swimming with tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dolly!&rdquo; he said, sobbing now; &ldquo;for mercy&rsquo;s
        sake, think of the children; they are not to blame! I am to blame, and
        punish me, make me expiate my fault. Anything I can do, I am ready to do
        anything! I am to blame, no words can express how much I am to blame!
        But, Dolly, forgive me!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She sat down. He listened to her hard, heavy breathing, and he was
        unutterably sorry for her. She tried several times to begin to speak,
        but could not. He waited.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You remember the children, Stiva, to play with them; but I
        remember them, and know that this means their ruin,&rdquo; she
        said&mdash;obviously one of the phrases she had more than once repeated
        to herself in the course of the last few days.
      </p>

      <p>
        She had called him &ldquo;Stiva,&rdquo; and he glanced at her with
        gratitude, and moved to take her hand, but she drew back from him with
        aversion.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think of the children, and for that reason I would do anything
        in the world to save them, but I don&rsquo;t myself know how to save
        them. By taking them away from their father, or by leaving them with a
        vicious father&mdash;yes, a vicious father.... Tell me, after what ...
        has happened, can we live together? Is that possible? Tell me, eh, is it
        possible?&rdquo; she repeated, raising her voice, &ldquo;after my
        husband, the father of my children, enters into a love affair with his
        own children&rsquo;s governess?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what could I do? what could I do?&rdquo; he kept saying in a
        pitiful voice, not knowing what he was saying, as his head sank lower
        and lower.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are loathsome to me, repulsive!&rdquo; she shrieked, getting
        more and more heated. &ldquo;Your tears mean nothing! You have never
        loved me; you have neither heart nor honorable feeling! You are hateful
        to me, disgusting, a stranger&mdash;yes, a complete stranger!&rdquo;
        With pain and wrath she uttered the word so terrible to
        herself&mdash;<i>stranger</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked at her, and the fury expressed in her face alarmed and amazed
        him. He did not understand how his pity for her exasperated her. She saw
        in him sympathy for her, but not love. &ldquo;No, she hates me. She will
        not forgive me,&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It is awful! awful!&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment in the next room a child began to cry; probably it had
        fallen down. Darya Alexandrovna listened, and her face suddenly
        softened.
      </p>

      <p>
        She seemed to be pulling herself together for a few seconds, as though
        she did not know where she was, and what she was doing, and getting up
        rapidly, she moved towards the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, she loves my child,&rdquo; he thought, noticing the change
        of her face at the child&rsquo;s cry, &ldquo;my child: how can she hate
        me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dolly, one word more,&rdquo; he said, following her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you come near me, I will call in the servants, the children!
        They may all know you are a scoundrel! I am going away at once, and you
        may live here with your mistress!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And she went out, slamming the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed, wiped his face, and with a subdued tread
        walked out of the room. &ldquo;Matvey says she will come round; but how?
        I don&rsquo;t see the least chance of it. Ah, oh, how horrible it is!
        And how vulgarly she shouted,&rdquo; he said to himself, remembering her
        shriek and the words&mdash;&ldquo;scoundrel&rdquo; and
        &ldquo;mistress.&rdquo; &ldquo;And very likely the maids were listening!
        Horribly vulgar! horrible!&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch stood a few
        seconds alone, wiped his face, squared his chest, and walked out of the
        room.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was Friday, and in the dining-room the German watchmaker was winding
        up the clock. Stepan Arkadyevitch remembered his joke about this
        punctual, bald watchmaker, &ldquo;that the German was wound up for a
        whole lifetime himself, to wind up watches,&rdquo; and he smiled. Stepan
        Arkadyevitch was fond of a joke: &ldquo;And maybe she will come round!
        That&rsquo;s a good expression, &lsquo;<i>come round,</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;
        he thought. &ldquo;I must repeat that.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Matvey!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Arrange everything with Darya
        in the sitting room for Anna Arkadyevna,&rdquo; he said to Matvey when
        he came in.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch put on his fur coat and went out onto the steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t dine at home?&rdquo; said Matvey, seeing him off.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as it happens. But here&rsquo;s for the
        housekeeping,&rdquo; he said, taking ten roubles from his pocketbook.
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be enough.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Enough or not enough, we must make it do,&rdquo; said Matvey,
        slamming the carriage door and stepping back onto the steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna meanwhile having pacified the child, and knowing from
        the sound of the carriage that he had gone off, went back again to her
        bedroom. It was her solitary refuge from the household cares which
        crowded upon her directly she went out from it. Even now, in the short
        time she had been in the nursery, the English governess and Matrona
        Philimonovna had succeeded in putting several questions to her, which
        did not admit of delay, and which only she could answer: &ldquo;What
        were the children to put on for their walk? Should they have any milk?
        Should not a new cook be sent for?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, let me alone, let me alone!&rdquo; she said, and going back
        to her bedroom she sat down in the same place as she had sat when
        talking to her husband, clasping tightly her thin hands with the rings
        that slipped down on her bony fingers, and fell to going over in her
        memory all the conversation. &ldquo;He has gone! But has he broken it
        off with her?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Can it be he sees her? Why
        didn&rsquo;t I ask him! No, no, reconciliation is impossible. Even if we
        remain in the same house, we are strangers&mdash;strangers
        forever!&rdquo; She repeated again with special significance the word so
        dreadful to her. &ldquo;And how I loved him! my God, how I loved him!...
        How I loved him! And now don&rsquo;t I love him? Don&rsquo;t I love him
        more than before? The most horrible thing is,&rdquo; she began, but did
        not finish her thought, because Matrona Philimonovna put her head in at
        the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us send for my brother,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he can get a
        dinner anyway, or we shall have the children getting nothing to eat till
        six again, like yesterday.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, I will come directly and see about it. But did you
        send for some new milk?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Darya Alexandrovna plunged into the duties of the day, and drowned
        her grief in them for a time.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 5</h3>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch had learned easily at school, thanks to his
        excellent abilities, but he had been idle and mischievous, and therefore
        was one of the lowest in his class. But in spite of his habitually
        dissipated mode of life, his inferior grade in the service, and his
        comparative youth, he occupied the honorable and lucrative position of
        president of one of the government boards at Moscow. This post he had
        received through his sister Anna&rsquo;s husband, Alexey Alexandrovitch
        Karenin, who held one of the most important positions in the ministry to
        whose department the Moscow office belonged. But if Karenin had not got
        his brother-in-law this berth, then through a hundred other
        personages&mdash;brothers, sisters, cousins, uncles, and
        aunts&mdash;Stiva Oblonsky would have received this post, or some other
        similar one, together with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful
        for him, as his affairs, in spite of his wife&rsquo;s considerable
        property, were in an embarrassed condition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Half Moscow and Petersburg were friends and relations of Stepan
        Arkadyevitch. He was born in the midst of those who had been and are the
        powerful ones of this world. One-third of the men in the government, the
        older men, had been friends of his father&rsquo;s, and had known him in
        petticoats; another third were his intimate chums, and the remainder
        were friendly acquaintances. Consequently the distributors of earthly
        blessings in the shape of places, rents, shares, and such, were all his
        friends, and could not overlook one of their own set; and Oblonsky had
        no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post. He had
        only not to refuse things, not to show jealousy, not to be quarrelsome
        or take offense, all of which from his characteristic good nature he
        never did. It would have struck him as absurd if he had been told that
        he would not get a position with the salary he required, especially as
        he expected nothing out of the way; he only wanted what the men of his
        own age and standing did get, and he was no worse qualified for
        performing duties of the kind than any other man.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely liked by all who knew him for his
        good humor, but for his bright disposition, and his unquestionable
        honesty. In him, in his handsome, radiant figure, his sparkling eyes,
        black hair and eyebrows, and the white and red of his face, there was
        something which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor
        on the people who met him. &ldquo;Aha! Stiva! Oblonsky! Here he
        is!&rdquo; was almost always said with a smile of delight on meeting
        him. Even though it happened at times that after a conversation with him
        it seemed that nothing particularly delightful had happened, the next
        day, and the next, everyone was just as delighted at meeting him again.
      </p>

      <p>
        After filling for three years the post of president of one of the
        government boards at Moscow, Stepan Arkadyevitch had won the respect, as
        well as the liking, of his fellow-officials, subordinates, and
        superiors, and all who had had business with him. The principal
        qualities in Stepan Arkadyevitch which had gained him this universal
        respect in the service consisted, in the first place, of his extreme
        indulgence for others, founded on a consciousness of his own
        shortcomings; secondly, of his perfect liberalism&mdash;not the
        liberalism he read of in the papers, but the liberalism that was in his
        blood, in virtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and
        exactly the same, whatever their fortune or calling might be; and
        thirdly&mdash;the most important point&mdash;his complete indifference
        to the business in which he was engaged, in consequence of which he was
        never carried away, and never made mistakes.
      </p>

      <p>
        On reaching the offices of the board, Stepan Arkadyevitch, escorted by a
        deferential porter with a portfolio, went into his little private room,
        put on his uniform, and went into the boardroom. The clerks and copyists
        all rose, greeting him with good-humored deference. Stepan Arkadyevitch
        moved quickly, as ever, to his place, shook hands with his colleagues,
        and sat down. He made a joke or two, and talked just as much as was
        consistent with due decorum, and began work. No one knew better than
        Stepan Arkadyevitch how to hit on the exact line between freedom,
        simplicity, and official stiffness necessary for the agreeable conduct
        of business. A secretary, with the good-humored deference common to
        everyone in Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s office, came up with papers, and
        began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been introduced
        by Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We have succeeded in getting the information from the government
        department of Penza. Here, would you care?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got them at last?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        laying his finger on the paper. &ldquo;Now, gentlemen....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And the sitting of the board began.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If they knew,&rdquo; he thought, bending his head with a
        significant air as he listened to the report, &ldquo;what a guilty
        little boy their president was half an hour ago.&rdquo; And his eyes
        were laughing during the reading of the report. Till two o&rsquo;clock
        the sitting would go on without a break, and at two o&rsquo;clock there
        would be an interval and luncheon.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was not yet two, when the large glass doors of the boardroom suddenly
        opened and someone came in.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the officials sitting on the further side under the portrait of the
        Tsar and the eagle, delighted at any distraction, looked round at the
        door; but the doorkeeper standing at the door at once drove out the
        intruder, and closed the glass door after him.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the case had been read through, Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and
        stretched, and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took out
        a cigarette in the boardroom and went into his private room. Two of the
        members of the board, the old veteran in the service, Nikitin, and the
        <i>Kammerjunker</i>
        Grinevitch, went in with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We shall have time to finish after lunch,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To be sure we shall!&rdquo; said Nikitin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A pretty sharp fellow this Fomin must be,&rdquo; said Grinevitch
        of one of the persons taking part in the case they were examining.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned at Grinevitch&rsquo;s words, giving him
        thereby to understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely,
        and made him no reply.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who was that came in?&rdquo; he asked the doorkeeper.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Someone, your excellency, crept in without permission directly my
        back was turned. He was asking for you. I told him: when the members
        come out, then....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s gone into the passage, but here he comes anyway.
        That is he,&rdquo; said the doorkeeper, pointing to a strongly built,
        broad-shouldered man with a curly beard, who, without taking off his
        sheepskin cap, was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the
        stone staircase. One of the members going down&mdash;a lean official
        with a portfolio&mdash;stood out of his way and looked disapprovingly at
        the legs of the stranger, then glanced inquiringly at Oblonsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch was standing at the top of the stairs. His
        good-naturedly beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform
        beamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s actually you, Levin, at last!&rdquo; he said with
        a friendly mocking smile, scanning Levin as he approached. &ldquo;How is
        it you have deigned to look me up in this den?&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, and not content with shaking hands, he kissed his friend.
        &ldquo;Have you been here long?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have just come, and very much wanted to see you,&rdquo; said
        Levin, looking shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily around.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go into my room,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, who knew his friend&rsquo;s sensitive and irritable
        shyness, and, taking his arm, he drew him along, as though guiding him
        through dangers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch was on familiar terms with almost all his
        acquaintances, and called almost all of them by their Christian names:
        old men of sixty, boys of twenty, actors, ministers, merchants, and
        adjutant-generals, so that many of his intimate chums were to be found
        at the extreme ends of the social ladder, and would have been very much
        surprised to learn that they had, through the medium of Oblonsky,
        something in common. He was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he
        took a glass of champagne, and he took a glass of champagne with
        everyone, and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums,
        as he used in joke to call many of his friends, in the presence of his
        subordinates, he well knew how, with his characteristic tact, to
        diminish the disagreeable impression made on them. Levin was not a
        disreputable chum, but Oblonsky, with his ready tact, felt that Levin
        fancied he might not care to show his intimacy with him before his
        subordinates, and so he made haste to take him off into his room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin was almost of the same age as Oblonsky; their intimacy did not
        rest merely on champagne. Levin had been the friend and companion of his
        early youth. They were fond of one another in spite of the difference of
        their characters and tastes, as friends are fond of one another who have
        been together in early youth. But in spite of this, each of
        them&mdash;as is often the way with men who have selected careers of
        different kinds&mdash;though in discussion he would even justify the
        other&rsquo;s career, in his heart despised it. It seemed to each of
        them that the life he led himself was the only real life, and the life
        led by his friend was a mere phantasm. Oblonsky could not restrain a
        slight mocking smile at the sight of Levin. How often he had seen him
        come up to Moscow from the country where he was doing something, but
        what precisely Stepan Arkadyevitch could never quite make out, and
        indeed he took no interest in the matter. Levin arrived in Moscow always
        excited and in a hurry, rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want
        of ease, and for the most part with a perfectly new, unexpected view of
        things. Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed at this, and liked it. In the same
        way Levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend, and
        his official duties, which he laughed at, and regarded as trifling. But
        the difference was that Oblonsky, as he was doing the same as everyone
        did, laughed complacently and good-humoredly, while Levin laughed
        without complacency and sometimes angrily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We have long been expecting you,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        going into his room and letting Levin&rsquo;s hand go as though to show
        that here all danger was over. &ldquo;I am very, very glad to see
        you,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Well, how are you? Eh? When did you
        come?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin was silent, looking at the unknown faces of Oblonsky&rsquo;s two
        companions, and especially at the hand of the elegant Grinevitch, which
        had such long white fingers, such long yellow filbert-shaped nails, and
        such huge shining studs on the shirt-cuff, that apparently they absorbed
        all his attention, and allowed him no freedom of thought. Oblonsky
        noticed this at once, and smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, to be sure, let me introduce you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My
        colleagues: Philip Ivanitch Nikitin, Mihail Stanislavitch
        Grinevitch&rdquo;&mdash;and turning to Levin&mdash;&ldquo;a district
        councilor, a modern district councilman, a gymnast who lifts thirteen
        stone with one hand, a cattle-breeder and sportsman, and my friend,
        Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, the brother of Sergey Ivanovitch
        Koznishev.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; said the veteran.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have the honor of knowing your brother, Sergey
        Ivanovitch,&rdquo; said Grinevitch, holding out his slender hand with
        its long nails.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin frowned, shook hands coldly, and at once turned to Oblonsky.
        Though he had a great respect for his half-brother, an author well known
        to all Russia, he could not endure it when people treated him not as
        Konstantin Levin, but as the brother of the celebrated Koznishev.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I am no longer a district councilor. I have quarreled with
        them all, and don&rsquo;t go to the meetings any more,&rdquo; he said,
        turning to Oblonsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been quick about it!&rdquo; said Oblonsky with a
        smile. &ldquo;But how? why?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story. I will tell you some time,&rdquo; said
        Levin, but he began telling him at once. &ldquo;Well, to put it shortly,
        I was convinced that nothing was really done by the district councils,
        or ever could be,&rdquo; he began, as though someone had just insulted
        him. &ldquo;On one side it&rsquo;s a plaything; they play at being a
        parliament, and I&rsquo;m neither young enough nor old enough to find
        amusement in playthings; and on the other side&rdquo; (he stammered)
        &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a means for the coterie of the district to make money.
        Formerly they had wardships, courts of justice, now they have the
        district council&mdash;not in the form of bribes, but in the form of
        unearned salary,&rdquo; he said, as hotly as though someone of those
        present had opposed his opinion.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Aha! You&rsquo;re in a new phase again, I see&mdash;a
        conservative,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;However, we can go
        into that later.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, later. But I wanted to see you,&rdquo; said Levin, looking
        with hatred at Grinevitch&rsquo;s hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch gave a scarcely perceptible smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How was it you used to say you would never wear European dress
        again?&rdquo; he said, scanning his new suit, obviously cut by a French
        tailor. &ldquo;Ah! I see: a new phase.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin suddenly blushed, not as grown men blush, slightly, without being
        themselves aware of it, but as boys blush, feeling that they are
        ridiculous through their shyness, and consequently ashamed of it and
        blushing still more, almost to the point of tears. And it was so strange
        to see this sensible, manly face in such a childish plight, that
        Oblonsky left off looking at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, where shall we meet? You know I want very much to talk to
        you,&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oblonsky seemed to ponder.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what: let&rsquo;s go to Gurin&rsquo;s to
        lunch, and there we can talk. I am free till three.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Levin, after an instant&rsquo;s thought,
        &ldquo;I have got to go on somewhere else.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All right, then, let&rsquo;s dine together.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dine together? But I have nothing very particular, only a few
        words to say, and a question I want to ask you, and we can have a talk
        afterwards.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, say the few words, then, at once, and we&rsquo;ll gossip
        after dinner.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this,&rdquo; said Levin; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s
        of no importance, though.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        His face all at once took an expression of anger from the effort he was
        making to surmount his shyness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What are the Shtcherbatskys doing? Everything as it used to
        be?&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had long known that Levin was in love with his
        sister-in-law, Kitty, gave a hardly perceptible smile, and his eyes
        sparkled merrily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You said a few words, but I can&rsquo;t answer in a few words,
        because.... Excuse me a minute....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        A secretary came in, with respectful familiarity and the modest
        consciousness, characteristic of every secretary, of superiority to his
        chief in the knowledge of their business; he went up to Oblonsky with
        some papers, and began, under pretense of asking a question, to explain
        some objection. Stepan Arkadyevitch, without hearing him out, laid his
        hand genially on the secretary&rsquo;s sleeve.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, you do as I told you,&rdquo; he said, softening his words
        with a smile, and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he
        turned away from the papers, and said: &ldquo;So do it that way, if you
        please, Zahar Nikititch.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The secretary retired in confusion. During the consultation with the
        secretary Levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment. He was
        standing with his elbows on the back of a chair, and on his face was a
        look of ironical attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it, I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo;
        he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo; said Oblonsky, smiling as
        brightly as ever, and picking up a cigarette. He expected some queer
        outburst from Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you are doing,&rdquo; said Levin,
        shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;How can you do it seriously?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, because there&rsquo;s nothing in it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You think so, but we&rsquo;re overwhelmed with work.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;On paper. But, there, you&rsquo;ve a gift for it,&rdquo; added
        Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s to say, you think there&rsquo;s a lack of something
        in me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said Levin. &ldquo;But all the same I admire
        your grandeur, and am proud that I&rsquo;ve a friend in such a great
        person. You&rsquo;ve not answered my question, though,&rdquo; he went
        on, with a desperate effort looking Oblonsky straight in the face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all very well. You wait a bit, and you&rsquo;ll
        come to this yourself. It&rsquo;s very nice for you to have over six
        thousand acres in the Karazinsky district, and such muscles, and the
        freshness of a girl of twelve; still you&rsquo;ll be one of us one day.
        Yes, as to your question, there is no change, but it&rsquo;s a pity
        you&rsquo;ve been away so long.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, why so?&rdquo; Levin queried, panic-stricken.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; responded Oblonsky. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk
        it over. But what&rsquo;s brought you up to town?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll talk about that, too, later on,&rdquo; said
        Levin, reddening again up to his ears.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All right. I see,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;I
        should ask you to come to us, you know, but my wife&rsquo;s not quite
        the thing. But I tell you what; if you want to see them, they&rsquo;re
        sure now to be at the Zoological Gardens from four to five. Kitty
        skates. You drive along there, and I&rsquo;ll come and fetch you, and
        we&rsquo;ll go and dine somewhere together.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Capital. So good-bye till then.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Now mind, you&rsquo;ll forget, I know you, or rush off home to
        the country!&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch called out laughing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, truly!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Levin went out of the room, only when he was in the doorway
        remembering that he had forgotten to take leave of Oblonsky&rsquo;s
        colleagues.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That gentleman must be a man of great energy,&rdquo; said
        Grinevitch, when Levin had gone away.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, nodding his
        head, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a lucky fellow! Over six thousand acres in the
        Karazinsky district; everything before him; and what youth and vigor!
        Not like some of us.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You have a great deal to complain of, haven&rsquo;t you, Stepan
        Arkadyevitch?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, yes, I&rsquo;m in a poor way, a bad way,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch with a heavy sigh.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 6</h3>

      <p>
        When Oblonsky asked Levin what had brought him to town, Levin blushed,
        and was furious with himself for blushing, because he could not answer,
        &ldquo;I have come to make your sister-in-law an offer,&rdquo; though
        that was precisely what he had come for.
      </p>

      <p>
        The families of the Levins and the Shtcherbatskys were old, noble Moscow
        families, and had always been on intimate and friendly terms. This
        intimacy had grown still closer during Levin&rsquo;s student days. He
        had both prepared for the university with the young Prince
        Shtcherbatsky, the brother of Kitty and Dolly, and had entered at the
        same time with him. In those days Levin used often to be in the
        Shtcherbatskys&rsquo; house, and he was in love with the Shtcherbatsky
        household. Strange as it may appear, it was with the household, the
        family, that Konstantin Levin was in love, especially with the feminine
        half of the household. Levin did not remember his own mother, and his
        only sister was older than he was, so that it was in the
        Shtcherbatskys&rsquo; house that he saw for the first time that inner
        life of an old, noble, cultivated, and honorable family of which he had
        been deprived by the death of his father and mother. All the members of
        that family, especially the feminine half, were pictured by him, as it
        were, wrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil, and he not only
        perceived no defects whatever in them, but under the poetical veil that
        shrouded them he assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and
        every possible perfection. Why it was the three young ladies had one day
        to speak French, and the next English; why it was that at certain hours
        they played by turns on the piano, the sounds of which were audible in
        their brother&rsquo;s room above, where the students used to work; why
        they were visited by those professors of French literature, of music, of
        drawing, of dancing; why at certain hours all the three young ladies,
        with Mademoiselle Linon, drove in the coach to the Tversky boulevard,
        dressed in their satin cloaks, Dolly in a long one, Natalia in a
        half-long one, and Kitty in one so short that her shapely legs in
        tightly-drawn red stockings were visible to all beholders; why it was
        they had to walk about the Tversky boulevard escorted by a footman with
        a gold cockade in his hat&mdash;all this and much more that was done in
        their mysterious world he did not understand, but he was sure that
        everything that was done there was very good, and he was in love
        precisely with the mystery of the proceedings.
      </p>

      <p>
        In his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest, Dolly,
        but she was soon married to Oblonsky. Then he began being in love with
        the second. He felt, as it were, that he had to be in love with one of
        the sisters, only he could not quite make out which. But Natalia, too,
        had hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the
        diplomat Lvov. Kitty was still a child when Levin left the university.
        Young Shtcherbatsky went into the navy, was drowned in the Baltic, and
        Levin&rsquo;s relations with the Shtcherbatskys, in spite of his
        friendship with Oblonsky, became less intimate. But when early in the
        winter of this year Levin came to Moscow, after a year in the country,
        and saw the Shtcherbatskys, he realized which of the three sisters he
        was indeed destined to love.
      </p>

      <p>
        One would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him, a man
        of good family, rather rich than poor, and thirty-two years old, to make
        the young Princess Shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage; in all
        likelihood he would at once have been looked upon as a good match. But
        Levin was in love, and so it seemed to him that Kitty was so perfect in
        every respect that she was a creature far above everything earthly; and
        that he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be
        conceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy
        of her.
      </p>

      <p>
        After spending two months in Moscow in a state of enchantment, seeing
        Kitty almost every day in society, into which he went so as to meet her,
        he abruptly decided that it could not be, and went back to the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin&rsquo;s conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea
        that in the eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless
        match for the charming Kitty, and that Kitty herself could not love him.
        In her family&rsquo;s eyes he had no ordinary, definite career and
        position in society, while his contemporaries by this time, when he was
        thirty-two, were already, one a colonel, and another a professor,
        another director of a bank and railways, or president of a board like
        Oblonsky. But he (he knew very well how he must appear to others) was a
        country gentleman, occupied in breeding cattle, shooting game, and
        building barns; in other words, a fellow of no ability, who had not
        turned out well, and who was doing just what, according to the ideas of
        the world, is done by people fit for nothing else.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mysterious, enchanting Kitty herself could not love such an ugly
        person as he conceived himself to be, and, above all, such an ordinary,
        in no way striking person. Moreover, his attitude to Kitty in the
        past&mdash;the attitude of a grown-up person to a child, arising from
        his friendship with her brother&mdash;seemed to him yet another obstacle
        to love. An ugly, good-natured man, as he considered himself, might, he
        supposed, be liked as a friend; but to be loved with such a love as that
        with which he loved Kitty, one would need to be a handsome and, still
        more, a distinguished man.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men, but he
        did not believe it, for he judged by himself, and he could not himself
        have loved any but beautiful, mysterious, and exceptional women.
      </p>

      <p>
        But after spending two months alone in the country, he was convinced
        that this was not one of those passions of which he had had experience
        in his early youth; that this feeling gave him not an instant&rsquo;s
        rest; that he could not live without deciding the question, would she or
        would she not be his wife, and that his despair had arisen only from his
        own imaginings, that he had no sort of proof that he would be rejected.
        And he had now come to Moscow with a firm determination to make an
        offer, and get married if he were accepted. Or ... he could not conceive
        what would become of him if he were rejected.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 7</h3>

      <p>
        On arriving in Moscow by a morning train, Levin had put up at the house
        of his elder half-brother, Koznishev. After changing his clothes he went
        down to his brother&rsquo;s study, intending to talk to him at once
        about the object of his visit, and to ask his advice; but his brother
        was not alone. With him there was a well-known professor of philosophy,
        who had come from Harkov expressly to clear up a difference that had
        arisen between them on a very important philosophical question. The
        professor was carrying on a hot crusade against materialists. Sergey
        Koznishev had been following this crusade with interest, and after
        reading the professor&rsquo;s last article, he had written him a letter
        stating his objections. He accused the professor of making too great
        concessions to the materialists. And the professor had promptly appeared
        to argue the matter out. The point in discussion was the question then
        in vogue: Is there a line to be drawn between psychological and
        physiological phenomena in man? and if so, where?
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness
        he always had for everyone, and introducing him to the professor, went
        on with the conversation.
      </p>

      <p>
        A little man in spectacles, with a narrow forehead, tore himself from
        the discussion for an instant to greet Levin, and then went on talking
        without paying any further attention to him. Levin sat down to wait till
        the professor should go, but he soon began to get interested in the
        subject under discussion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were
        disputing, and had read them, interested in them as a development of the
        first principles of science, familiar to him as a natural science
        student at the university. But he had never connected these scientific
        deductions as to the origin of man as an animal, as to reflex action,
        biology, and sociology, with those questions as to the meaning of life
        and death to himself, which had of late been more and more often in his
        mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he listened to his brother&rsquo;s argument with the professor, he
        noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those
        spiritual problems, that at times they almost touched on the latter; but
        every time they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point, they
        promptly beat a hasty retreat, and plunged again into a sea of subtle
        distinctions, reservations, quotations, allusions, and appeals to
        authorities, and it was with difficulty that he understood what they
        were talking about.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot admit it,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch, with his
        habitual clearness, precision of expression, and elegance of phrase.
        &ldquo;I cannot in any case agree with Keiss that my whole conception of
        the external world has been derived from perceptions. The most
        fundamental idea, the idea of existence, has not been received by me
        through sensation; indeed, there is no special sense-organ for the
        transmission of such an idea.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but they&mdash;Wurt, and Knaust, and Pripasov&mdash;would
        answer that your consciousness of existence is derived from the
        conjunction of all your sensations, that that consciousness of existence
        is the result of your sensations. Wurt, indeed, says plainly that,
        assuming there are no sensations, it follows that there is no idea of
        existence.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I maintain the contrary,&rdquo; began Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        But here it seemed to Levin that just as they were close upon the real
        point of the matter, they were again retreating, and he made up his mind
        to put a question to the professor.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;According to that, if my senses are annihilated, if my body is
        dead, I can have no existence of any sort?&rdquo; he queried.
      </p>

      <p>
        The professor, in annoyance, and, as it were, mental suffering at the
        interruption, looked round at the strange inquirer, more like a bargeman
        than a philosopher, and turned his eyes upon Sergey Ivanovitch, as
        though to ask: What&rsquo;s one to say to him? But Sergey Ivanovitch,
        who had been talking with far less heat and one-sidedness than the
        professor, and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer the
        professor, and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural
        point of view from which the question was put, smiled and said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That question we have no right to answer as yet.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We have not the requisite data,&rdquo; chimed in the professor,
        and he went back to his argument. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I
        would point out the fact that if, as Pripasov directly asserts,
        perception is based on sensation, then we are bound to distinguish
        sharply between these two conceptions.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin listened no more, and simply waited for the professor to go.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 8</h3>

      <p>
        When the professor had gone, Sergey Ivanovitch turned to his brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Delighted that you&rsquo;ve come. For some time, is it?
        How&rsquo;s your farming getting on?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming, and
        only put the question in deference to him, and so he only told him about
        the sale of his wheat and money matters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get married,
        and to ask his advice; he had indeed firmly resolved to do so. But after
        seeing his brother, listening to his conversation with the professor,
        hearing afterwards the unconsciously patronizing tone in which his
        brother questioned him about agricultural matters (their mother&rsquo;s
        property had not been divided, and Levin took charge of both their
        shares), Levin felt that he could not for some reason begin to talk to
        him of his intention of marrying. He felt that his brother would not
        look at it as he would have wished him to.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, how is your district council doing?&rdquo; asked Sergey
        Ivanovitch, who was greatly interested in these local boards and
        attached great importance to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What! Why, surely you&rsquo;re a member of the board?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not a member now; I&rsquo;ve resigned,&rdquo;
        answered Levin, &ldquo;and I no longer attend the meetings.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; commented Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin in self-defense began to describe what took place in the meetings
        in his district.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it always is!&rdquo; Sergey Ivanovitch
        interrupted him. &ldquo;We Russians are always like that. Perhaps
        it&rsquo;s our strong point, really, the faculty of seeing our own
        shortcomings; but we overdo it, we comfort ourselves with irony which we
        always have on the tip of our tongues. All I say is, give such rights as
        our local self-government to any other European people&mdash;why, the
        Germans or the English would have worked their way to freedom from them,
        while we simply turn them into ridicule.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But how can it be helped?&rdquo; said Levin penitently. &ldquo;It
        was my last effort. And I did try with all my soul. I can&rsquo;t.
        I&rsquo;m no good at it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re no good at it,&rdquo; said
        Sergey Ivanovitch; &ldquo;it is that you don&rsquo;t look at it as you
        should.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; Levin answered dejectedly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! do you know brother Nikolay&rsquo;s turned up again?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This brother Nikolay was the elder brother of Konstantin Levin, and
        half-brother of Sergey Ivanovitch; a man utterly ruined, who had
        dissipated the greater part of his fortune, was living in the strangest
        and lowest company, and had quarreled with his brothers.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Levin cried with horror. &ldquo;How do
        you know?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Prokofy saw him in the street.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here in Moscow? Where is he? Do you know?&rdquo; Levin got up
        from his chair, as though on the point of starting off at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am sorry I told you,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch, shaking his
        head at his younger brother&rsquo;s excitement. &ldquo;I sent to find
        out where he is living, and sent him his IOU to Trubin, which I paid.
        This is the answer he sent me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Sergey Ivanovitch took a note from under a paper-weight and handed
        it to his brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin read in the queer, familiar handwriting: &ldquo;I humbly beg you
        to leave me in peace. That&rsquo;s the only favor I ask of my gracious
        brothers.&mdash;Nikolay Levin.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin read it, and without raising his head stood with the note in his
        hands opposite Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget his
        unhappy brother for the time, and the consciousness that it would be
        base to do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He obviously wants to offend me,&rdquo; pursued Sergey
        Ivanovitch; &ldquo;but he cannot offend me, and I should have wished
        with all my heart to assist him, but I know it&rsquo;s impossible to do
        that.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; repeated Levin. &ldquo;I understand and
        appreciate your attitude to him; but I shall go and see him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you want to, do; but I shouldn&rsquo;t advise it,&rdquo; said
        Sergey Ivanovitch. &ldquo;As regards myself, I have no fear of your
        doing so; he will not make you quarrel with me; but for your own sake, I
        should say you would do better not to go. You can&rsquo;t do him any
        good; still, do as you please.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very likely I can&rsquo;t do any good, but I
        feel&mdash;especially at such a moment&mdash;but that&rsquo;s another
        thing&mdash;I feel I could not be at peace.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, that I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Sergey
        Ivanovitch. &ldquo;One thing I do understand,&rdquo; he added;
        &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a lesson in humility. I have come to look very
        differently and more charitably on what is called infamous since brother
        Nikolay has become what he is ... you know what he did....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s awful, awful!&rdquo; repeated Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        After obtaining his brother&rsquo;s address from Sergey
        Ivanovitch&rsquo;s footman, Levin was on the point of setting off at
        once to see him, but on second thought he decided to put off his visit
        till the evening. The first thing to do to set his heart at rest was to
        accomplish what he had come to Moscow for. From his brother&rsquo;s
        Levin went to Oblonsky&rsquo;s office, and on getting news of the
        Shtcherbatskys from him, he drove to the place where he had been told he
        might find Kitty.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 9</h3>

      <p>
        At four o&rsquo;clock, conscious of his throbbing heart, Levin stepped
        out of a hired sledge at the Zoological Gardens, and turned along the
        path to the frozen mounds and the skating ground, knowing that he would
        certainly find her there, as he had seen the Shtcherbatskys&rsquo;
        carriage at the entrance.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was a bright, frosty day. Rows of carriages, sledges, drivers, and
        policemen were standing in the approach. Crowds of well-dressed people,
        with hats bright in the sun, swarmed about the entrance and along the
        well-swept little paths between the little houses adorned with carving
        in the Russian style. The old curly birches of the gardens, all their
        twigs laden with snow, looked as though freshly decked in sacred
        vestments.
      </p>

      <p>
        He walked along the path towards the skating-ground, and kept saying to
        himself&mdash;&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be excited, you must be calm.
        What&rsquo;s the matter with you? What do you want? Be quiet,
        stupid,&rdquo; he conjured his heart. And the more he tried to compose
        himself, the more breathless he found himself. An acquaintance met him
        and called him by his name, but Levin did not even recognize him. He
        went towards the mounds, whence came the clank of the chains of sledges
        as they slipped down or were dragged up, the rumble of the sliding
        sledges, and the sounds of merry voices. He walked on a few steps, and
        the skating-ground lay open before his eyes, and at once, amidst all the
        skaters, he knew her.
      </p>

      <p>
        He knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized on his
        heart. She was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the
        ground. There was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her
        attitude. But for Levin she was as easy to find in that crowd as a rose
        among nettles. Everything was made bright by her. She was the smile that
        shed light on all round her. &ldquo;Is it possible I can go over there
        on the ice, go up to her?&rdquo; he thought. The place where she stood
        seemed to him a holy shrine, unapproachable, and there was one moment
        when he was almost retreating, so overwhelmed was he with terror. He had
        to make an effort to master himself, and to remind himself that people
        of all sorts were moving about her, and that he too might come there to
        skate. He walked down, for a long while avoiding looking at her as at
        the sun, but seeing her, as one does the sun, without looking.
      </p>

      <p>
        On that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set, all
        acquainted with one another, used to meet on the ice. There were crack
        skaters there, showing off their skill, and learners clinging to chairs
        with timid, awkward movements, boys, and elderly people skating with
        hygienic motives. They seemed to Levin an elect band of blissful beings
        because they were here, near her. All the skaters, it seemed, with
        perfect self-possession, skated towards her, skated by her, even spoke
        to her, and were happy, quite apart from her, enjoying the capital ice
        and the fine weather.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nikolay Shtcherbatsky, Kitty&rsquo;s cousin, in a short jacket and tight
        trousers, was sitting on a garden seat with his skates on. Seeing Levin,
        he shouted to him:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, the first skater in Russia! Been here long? First-rate
        ice&mdash;do put your skates on.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got my skates,&rdquo; Levin answered, marveling
        at this boldness and ease in her presence, and not for one second losing
        sight of her, though he did not look at her. He felt as though the sun
        were coming near him. She was in a corner, and turning out her slender
        feet in their high boots with obvious timidity, she skated towards him.
        A boy in Russian dress, desperately waving his arms and bowed down to
        the ground, overtook her. She skated a little uncertainly; taking her
        hands out of the little muff that hung on a cord, she held them ready
        for emergency, and looking towards Levin, whom she had recognized, she
        smiled at him, and at her own fears. When she had got round the turn,
        she gave herself a push off with one foot, and skated straight up to
        Shtcherbatsky. Clutching at his arm, she nodded smiling to Levin. She
        was more splendid than he had imagined her.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he thought of her, he could call up a vivid picture of her to
        himself, especially the charm of that little fair head, so freely set on
        the shapely girlish shoulders, and so full of childish brightness and
        good humor. The childishness of her expression, together with the
        delicate beauty of her figure, made up her special charm, and that he
        fully realized. But what always struck him in her as something unlooked
        for, was the expression of her eyes, soft, serene, and truthful, and
        above all, her smile, which always transported Levin to an enchanted
        world, where he felt himself softened and tender, as he remembered
        himself in some days of his early childhood.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you been here long?&rdquo; she said, giving him her hand.
        &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she added, as he picked up the handkerchief
        that had fallen out of her muff.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I? I&rsquo;ve not long ... yesterday ... I mean today ... I
        arrived,&rdquo; answered Levin, in his emotion not at once understanding
        her question. &ldquo;I was meaning to come and see you,&rdquo; he said;
        and then, recollecting with what intention he was trying to see her, he
        was promptly overcome with confusion and blushed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you could skate, and skate so well.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She looked at him earnestly, as though wishing to make out the cause of
        his confusion.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Your praise is worth having. The tradition is kept up here that
        you are the best of skaters,&rdquo; she said, with her little
        black-gloved hand brushing a grain of hoarfrost off her muff.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I used once to skate with passion; I wanted to reach
        perfection.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You do everything with passion, I think,&rdquo; she said smiling.
        &ldquo;I should so like to see how you skate. Put on skates, and let us
        skate together.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Skate together! Can that be possible?&rdquo; thought Levin,
        gazing at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put them on directly,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        And he went off to get skates.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long while since we&rsquo;ve seen you here,
        sir,&rdquo; said the attendant, supporting his foot, and screwing on the
        heel of the skate. &ldquo;Except you, there&rsquo;s none of the
        gentlemen first-rate skaters. Will that be all right?&rdquo; said he,
        tightening the strap.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, yes; make haste, please,&rdquo; answered Levin, with
        difficulty restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his
        face. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;this now is life, this is
        happiness!
        <i>Together,</i> she said; <i>let us skate together!</i> Speak to her
        now? But that&rsquo;s just why I&rsquo;m afraid to speak&mdash;because
        I&rsquo;m happy now, happy in hope, anyway.... And then?... But I must!
        I must! I must! Away with weakness!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin rose to his feet, took off his overcoat, and scurrying over the
        rough ice round the hut, came out on the smooth ice and skated without
        effort, as it were, by simple exercise of will, increasing and
        slackening speed and turning his course. He approached with timidity,
        but again her smile reassured him.
      </p>

      <p>
        She gave him her hand, and they set off side by side, going faster and
        faster, and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she grasped his
        hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;With you I should soon learn; I somehow feel confidence in
        you,&rdquo; she said to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And I have confidence in myself when you are leaning on
        me,&rdquo; he said, but was at once panic-stricken at what he had said,
        and blushed. And indeed, no sooner had he uttered these words, when all
        at once, like the sun going behind a cloud, her face lost all its
        friendliness, and Levin detected the familiar change in her expression
        that denoted the working of thought; a crease showed on her smooth brow.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is there anything troubling you?&mdash;though I&rsquo;ve no right
        to ask such a question,&rdquo; he added hurriedly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, why so?... No, I have nothing to trouble me,&rdquo; she
        responded coldly; and she added immediately: &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
        seen Mlle. Linon, have you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Go and speak to her, she likes you so much.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? I have offended her. Lord help me!&rdquo;
        thought Levin, and he flew towards the old Frenchwoman with the gray
        ringlets, who was sitting on a bench. Smiling and showing her false
        teeth, she greeted him as an old friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you see we&rsquo;re growing up,&rdquo; she said to him,
        glancing towards Kitty, &ldquo;and growing old. <i>Tiny bear</i> has
        grown big now!&rdquo; pursued the Frenchwoman, laughing, and she
        reminded him of his joke about the three young ladies whom he had
        compared to the three bears in the English nursery tale. &ldquo;Do you
        remember that&rsquo;s what you used to call them?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He remembered absolutely nothing, but she had been laughing at the joke
        for ten years now, and was fond of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, go and skate, go and skate. Our Kitty has learned to skate
        nicely, hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        When Levin darted up to Kitty her face was no longer stern; her eyes
        looked at him with the same sincerity and friendliness, but Levin
        fancied that in her friendliness there was a certain note of deliberate
        composure. And he felt depressed. After talking a little of her old
        governess and her peculiarities, she questioned him about his life.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Surely you must be dull in the country in the winter,
        aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not dull, I am very busy,&rdquo; he said, feeling
        that she was holding him in check by her composed tone, which he would
        not have the force to break through, just as it had been at the
        beginning of the winter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you going to stay in town long?&rdquo; Kitty questioned him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered, not thinking of what he
        was saying. The thought that if he were held in check by her tone of
        quiet friendliness he would end by going back again without deciding
        anything came into his mind, and he resolved to make a struggle against
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How is it you don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It depends upon you,&rdquo; he said, and was
        immediately horror-stricken at his own words.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether it was that she had heard his words, or that she did not want to
        hear them, she made a sort of stumble, twice struck out, and hurriedly
        skated away from him. She skated up to Mlle. Linon, said something to
        her, and went towards the pavilion where the ladies took off their
        skates.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My God! what have I done! Merciful God! help me, guide me,&rdquo;
        said Levin, praying inwardly, and at the same time, feeling a need of
        violent exercise, he skated about describing inner and outer circles.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment one of the young men, the best of the skaters of the day,
        came out of the coffee-house in his skates, with a cigarette in his
        mouth. Taking a run, he dashed down the steps in his skates, crashing
        and bounding up and down. He flew down, and without even changing the
        position of his hands, skated away over the ice.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s a new trick!&rdquo; said Levin, and he promptly
        ran up to the top to do this new trick.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t break your neck! it needs practice!&rdquo; Nikolay
        Shtcherbatsky shouted after him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin went to the steps, took a run from above as best he could, and
        dashed down, preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his
        hands. On the last step he stumbled, but barely touching the ice with
        his hand, with a violent effort recovered himself, and skated off,
        laughing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How splendid, how nice he is!&rdquo; Kitty was thinking at that
        time, as she came out of the pavilion with Mlle. Linon, and looked
        towards him with a smile of quiet affection, as though he were a
        favorite brother. &ldquo;And can it be my fault, can I have done
        anything wrong? They talk of flirtation. I know it&rsquo;s not he that I
        love; but still I am happy with him, and he&rsquo;s so jolly. Only, why
        did he say that?...&rdquo; she mused.
      </p>

      <p>
        Catching sight of Kitty going away, and her mother meeting her at the
        steps, Levin, flushed from his rapid exercise, stood still and pondered
        a minute. He took off his skates, and overtook the mother and daughter
        at the entrance of the gardens.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Delighted to see you,&rdquo; said Princess Shtcherbatskaya.
        &ldquo;On Thursdays we are home, as always.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Today, then?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We shall be pleased to see you,&rdquo; the princess said stiffly.
      </p>

      <p>
        This stiffness hurt Kitty, and she could not resist the desire to smooth
        over her mother&rsquo;s coldness. She turned her head, and with a smile
        said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Good-bye till this evening.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment Stepan Arkadyevitch, his hat cocked on one side, with
        beaming face and eyes, strode into the garden like a conquering hero.
        But as he approached his mother-in-law, he responded in a mournful and
        crestfallen tone to her inquiries about Dolly&rsquo;s health. After a
        little subdued and dejected conversation with his mother-in-law, he
        threw out his chest again, and put his arm in Levin&rsquo;s.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, shall we set off?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
        thinking about you all this time, and I&rsquo;m very, very glad
        you&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; he said, looking him in the face with a
        significant air.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, come along,&rdquo; answered Levin in ecstasy, hearing
        unceasingly the sound of that voice saying, &ldquo;Good-bye till this
        evening,&rdquo; and seeing the smile with which it was said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To the England or the Hermitage?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind which.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All right, then, the England,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        selecting that restaurant because he owed more there than at the
        Hermitage, and consequently considered it mean to avoid it. &ldquo;Have
        you got a sledge? That&rsquo;s first-rate, for I sent my carriage
        home.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The friends hardly spoke all the way. Levin was wondering what that
        change in Kitty&rsquo;s expression had meant, and alternately assuring
        himself that there was hope, and falling into despair, seeing clearly
        that his hopes were insane, and yet all the while he felt himself quite
        another man, utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those
        words, &ldquo;Good-bye till this evening.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu
        of the dinner.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You like turbot, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said to Levin as they
        were arriving.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; responded Levin. &ldquo;Turbot? Yes, I&rsquo;m
        <i>awfully</i>
        fond of turbot.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 10</h3>

      <p>
        When Levin went into the restaurant with Oblonsky, he could not help
        noticing a certain peculiarity of expression, as it were, a restrained
        radiance, about the face and whole figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch.
        Oblonsky took off his overcoat, and with his hat over one ear walked
        into the dining-room, giving directions to the Tatar waiters, who were
        clustered about him in evening coats, bearing napkins. Bowing to right
        and left to the people he met, and here as everywhere joyously greeting
        acquaintances, he went up to the sideboard for a preliminary appetizer
        of fish and vodka, and said to the painted Frenchwoman decked in
        ribbons, lace, and ringlets, behind the counter, something so amusing
        that even that Frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter. Levin for his
        part refrained from taking any vodka simply because he felt such a
        loathing of that Frenchwoman, all made up, it seemed, of false hair,
        <i>poudre de riz,</i> and <i>vinaigre de toilette</i>. He made haste to
        move away from her, as from a dirty place. His whole soul was filled
        with memories of Kitty, and there was a smile of triumph and happiness
        shining in his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This way, your excellency, please. Your excellency won&rsquo;t be
        disturbed here,&rdquo; said a particularly pertinacious, white-headed
        old Tatar with immense hips and coat-tails gaping widely behind.
        &ldquo;Walk in, your excellency,&rdquo; he said to Levin; by way of
        showing his respect to Stepan Arkadyevitch, being attentive to his guest
        as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze
        chandelier, though it already had a table cloth on it, he pushed up
        velvet chairs, and came to a standstill before Stepan Arkadyevitch with
        a napkin and a bill of fare in his hands, awaiting his commands.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you prefer it, your excellency, a private room will be free
        directly; Prince Golistin with a lady. Fresh oysters have come
        in.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! oysters.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch became thoughtful.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How if we were to change our program, Levin?&rdquo; he said,
        keeping his finger on the bill of fare. And his face expressed serious
        hesitation. &ldquo;Are the oysters good? Mind now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They&rsquo;re Flensburg, your excellency. We&rsquo;ve no
        Ostend.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Flensburg will do, but are they fresh?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Only arrived yesterday.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change
        the whole program? Eh?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same to me. I should like cabbage soup and
        porridge better than anything; but of course there&rsquo;s nothing like
        that here.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Porridge à la Russe,</i> your honor would like?&rdquo; said
        the Tatar, bending down to Levin, like a nurse speaking to a child.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, joking apart, whatever you choose is sure to be good.
        I&rsquo;ve been skating, and I&rsquo;m hungry. And don&rsquo;t
        imagine,&rdquo; he added, detecting a look of dissatisfaction on
        Oblonsky&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;that I shan&rsquo;t appreciate your
        choice. I am fond of good things.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I should hope so! After all, it&rsquo;s one of the pleasures of
        life,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;Well, then, my friend, you
        give us two&mdash;or better say three&mdash;dozen oysters, clear soup
        with vegetables....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Printanière,</i>&rdquo; prompted the Tatar. But Stepan
        Arkadyevitch apparently did not care to allow him the satisfaction of
        giving the French names of the dishes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;With vegetables in it, you know. Then turbot with thick sauce,
        then ... roast beef; and mind it&rsquo;s good. Yes, and capons, perhaps,
        and then sweets.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The Tatar, recollecting that it was Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s way not
        to call the dishes by the names in the French bill of fare, did not
        repeat them after him, but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to
        himself according to the bill:&mdash;&ldquo;<i
          >Soupe printanière, turbot, sauce Beaumarchais, poulard à
          l&rsquo;estragon, macédoine de fruits</i
        >
        ... etc.,&rdquo; and then instantly, as though worked by springs, laying
        down one bound bill of fare, he took up another, the list of wines, and
        submitted it to Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What shall we drink?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What you like, only not too much. Champagne,&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What! to start with? You&rsquo;re right though, I dare say. Do
        you like the white seal?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;<i>Cachet blanc,</i>&rdquo; prompted the Tatar.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, then, give us that brand with the oysters, and then
        we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir. And what table wine?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You can give us Nuits. Oh, no, better the classic Chablis.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. And <i>your</i> cheese, your excellency?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, Parmesan. Or would you like another?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s all the same to me,&rdquo; said Levin, unable to
        suppress a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the Tatar ran off with flying coat-tails, and in five minutes darted
        in with a dish of opened oysters on mother-of-pearl shells, and a bottle
        between his fingers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch crushed the starchy napkin, tucked it into his
        waistcoat, and settling his arms comfortably, started on the oysters.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; he said, stripping the oysters from the pearly
        shell with a silver fork, and swallowing them one after another.
        &ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; he repeated, turning his dewy, brilliant eyes
        from Levin to the Tatar.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin ate the oysters indeed, though white bread and cheese would have
        pleased him better. But he was admiring Oblonsky. Even the Tatar,
        uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate
        glasses, glanced at Stepan Arkadyevitch, and settled his white cravat
        with a perceptible smile of satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care much for oysters, do you?&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, emptying his wine-glass, &ldquo;or you&rsquo;re worried
        about something. Eh?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He wanted Levin to be in good spirits. But it was not that Levin was not
        in good spirits; he was ill at ease. With what he had in his soul, he
        felt sore and uncomfortable in the restaurant, in the midst of private
        rooms where men were dining with ladies, in all this fuss and bustle;
        the surroundings of bronzes, looking-glasses, gas, and waiters&mdash;all
        of it was offensive to him. He was afraid of sullying what his soul was
        brimful of.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I? Yes, I am; but besides, all this bothers me,&rdquo; he said.
        &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t conceive how queer it all seems to a country
        person like me, as queer as that gentleman&rsquo;s nails I saw at your
        place....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I saw how much interested you were in poor
        Grinevitch&rsquo;s nails,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much for me,&rdquo; responded Levin. &ldquo;Do
        try, now, and put yourself in my place, take the point of view of a
        country person. We in the country try to bring our hands into such a
        state as will be most convenient for working with. So we cut our nails;
        sometimes we turn up our sleeves. And here people purposely let their
        nails grow as long as they will, and link on small saucers by way of
        studs, so that they can do nothing with their hands.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled gaily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, that&rsquo;s just a sign that he has no need to do
        coarse work. His work is with the mind....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Maybe. But still it&rsquo;s queer to me, just as at this moment
        it seems queer to me that we country folks try to get our meals over as
        soon as we can, so as to be ready for our work, while here are we trying
        to drag out our meal as long as possible, and with that object eating
        oysters....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; objected Stepan Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;But
        that&rsquo;s just the aim of civilization&mdash;to make everything a
        source of enjoyment.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s its aim, I&rsquo;d rather be a
        savage.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And so you are a savage. All you Levins are savages.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin sighed. He remembered his brother Nikolay, and felt ashamed and
        sore, and he scowled; but Oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at
        once drew his attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I say, are you going tonight to our people, the
        Shtcherbatskys&rsquo;, I mean?&rdquo; he said, his eyes sparkling
        significantly as he pushed away the empty rough shells, and drew the
        cheese towards him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I shall certainly go,&rdquo; replied Levin; &ldquo;though I
        fancied the princess was not very warm in her invitation.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What nonsense! That&rsquo;s her manner.... Come, boy, the
        soup!... That&rsquo;s her manner&mdash;<i>grande dame,</i>&rdquo; said
        Stepan Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming, too, but I have to go to
        the Countess Bonina&rsquo;s rehearsal. Come, isn&rsquo;t it true that
        you&rsquo;re a savage? How do you explain the sudden way in which you
        vanished from Moscow? The Shtcherbatskys were continually asking me
        about you, as though I ought to know. The only thing I know is that you
        always do what no one else does.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Levin, slowly and with emotion,
        &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right. I am a savage. Only, my savageness is not in
        having gone away, but in coming now. Now I have come....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, what a lucky fellow you are!&rdquo; broke in Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, looking into Levin&rsquo;s eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="poem">
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I know a gallant steed by tokens sure,<br />
        And by his eyes I know a youth in love,&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="noindent">
        declaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;Everything is before you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, is it over for you already?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; not over exactly, but the future is yours, and the present is
        mine, and the present&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s not all that it might
        be.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, things go wrong. But I don&rsquo;t want to talk of myself,
        and besides I can&rsquo;t explain it all,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;Well, why have you come to Moscow, then?... Hi!
        take away!&rdquo; he called to the Tatar.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You guess?&rdquo; responded Levin, his eyes like deep wells of
        light fixed on Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I guess, but I can&rsquo;t be the first to talk about it. You can
        see by that whether I guess right or wrong,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, gazing at Levin with a subtle smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and what have you to say to me?&rdquo; said Levin in a
        quivering voice, feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering
        too. &ldquo;How do you look at the question?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch slowly emptied his glass of Chablis, never taking
        his eyes off Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing
        I desire so much as that&mdash;nothing! It would be the best thing that
        could be.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not making a mistake? You know what we&rsquo;re
        speaking of?&rdquo; said Levin, piercing him with his eyes. &ldquo;You
        think it&rsquo;s possible?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s possible. Why not possible?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No! do you really think it&rsquo;s possible? No, tell me all you
        think! Oh, but if ... if refusal&rsquo;s in store for me!... Indeed I
        feel sure....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why should you think that?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        smiling at his excitement.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It seems so to me sometimes. That will be awful for me, and for
        her too.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, anyway there&rsquo;s nothing awful in it for a girl.
        Every girl&rsquo;s proud of an offer.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, every girl, but not she.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled. He so well knew that feeling of
        Levin&rsquo;s, that for him all the girls in the world were divided into
        two classes: one class&mdash;all the girls in the world except her, and
        those girls with all sorts of human weaknesses, and very ordinary girls:
        the other class&mdash;she alone, having no weaknesses of any sort and
        higher than all humanity.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Stay, take some sauce,&rdquo; he said, holding back Levin&rsquo;s
        hand as it pushed away the sauce.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin obediently helped himself to sauce, but would not let Stepan
        Arkadyevitch go on with his dinner.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, stop a minute, stop a minute,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must
        understand that it&rsquo;s a question of life and death for me. I have
        never spoken to anyone of this. And there&rsquo;s no one I could speak
        of it to, except you. You know we&rsquo;re utterly unlike each other,
        different tastes and views and everything; but I know you&rsquo;re fond
        of me and understand me, and that&rsquo;s why I like you awfully. But
        for God&rsquo;s sake, be quite straightforward with me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you what I think,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        smiling. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll say more: my wife is a wonderful
        woman....&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed, remembering his position
        with his wife, and, after a moment&rsquo;s silence,
        resumed&mdash;&ldquo;She has a gift of foreseeing things. She sees right
        through people; but that&rsquo;s not all; she knows what will come to
        pass, especially in the way of marriages. She foretold, for instance,
        that Princess Shahovskaya would marry Brenteln. No one would believe it,
        but it came to pass. And she&rsquo;s on your side.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only that she likes you&mdash;she says that Kitty
        is certain to be your wife.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At these words Levin&rsquo;s face suddenly lighted up with a smile, a
        smile not far from tears of emotion.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She says that!&rdquo; cried Levin. &ldquo;I always said she was
        exquisite, your wife. There, that&rsquo;s enough, enough said about
        it,&rdquo; he said, getting up from his seat.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All right, but do sit down.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But Levin could not sit down. He walked with his firm tread twice up and
        down the little cage of a room, blinked his eyelids that his tears might
        not fall, and only then sat down to the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You must understand,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not love.
        I&rsquo;ve been in love, but it&rsquo;s not that. It&rsquo;s not my
        feeling, but a sort of force outside me has taken possession of me. I
        went away, you see, because I made up my mind that it could never be,
        you understand, as a happiness that does not come on earth; but
        I&rsquo;ve struggled with myself, I see there&rsquo;s no living without
        it. And it must be settled.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What did you go away for?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, stop a minute! Ah, the thoughts that come crowding on one!
        The questions one must ask oneself! Listen. You can&rsquo;t imagine what
        you&rsquo;ve done for me by what you said. I&rsquo;m so happy that
        I&rsquo;ve become positively hateful; I&rsquo;ve forgotten everything. I
        heard today that my brother Nikolay ... you know, he&rsquo;s here ... I
        had even forgotten him. It seems to me that he&rsquo;s happy too.
        It&rsquo;s a sort of madness. But one thing&rsquo;s awful.... Here,
        you&rsquo;ve been married, you know the feeling ... it&rsquo;s awful
        that we&mdash;old&mdash;with a past ... not of love, but of sins ... are
        brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent; it&rsquo;s
        loathsome, and that&rsquo;s why one can&rsquo;t help feeling oneself
        unworthy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, you&rsquo;ve not many sins on your conscience.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas! all the same,&rdquo; said Levin, &ldquo;when with loathing
        I go over my life, I shudder and curse and bitterly regret it....
        Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What would you have? The world&rsquo;s made so,&rdquo; said
        Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The one comfort is like that prayer, which I always liked:
        &lsquo;Forgive me not according to my unworthiness, but according to Thy
        loving-kindness.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the only way she can forgive
        me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 11</h3>

      <p>
        Levin emptied his glass, and they were silent for a while.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one other thing I ought to tell you. Do you know
        Vronsky?&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. Why do you ask?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Give us another bottle,&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch directed the
        Tatar, who was filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just
        when he was not wanted.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why you ought to know Vronsky is that he&rsquo;s one of your
        rivals.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Vronsky?&rdquo; said Levin, and his face was suddenly
        transformed from the look of childlike ecstasy which Oblonsky had just
        been admiring to an angry and unpleasant expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Vronsky is one of the sons of Count Kirill Ivanovitch Vronsky,
        and one of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of Petersburg. I
        made his acquaintance in Tver when I was there on official business, and
        he came there for the levy of recruits. Fearfully rich, handsome, great
        connections, an aide-de-camp, and with all that a very nice,
        good-natured fellow. But he&rsquo;s more than simply a good-natured
        fellow, as I&rsquo;ve found out here&mdash;he&rsquo;s a cultivated man,
        too, and very intelligent; he&rsquo;s a man who&rsquo;ll make his
        mark.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin scowled and was dumb.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, he turned up here soon after you&rsquo;d gone, and as I can
        see, he&rsquo;s over head and ears in love with Kitty, and you know that
        her mother....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, but I know nothing,&rdquo; said Levin, frowning
        gloomily. And immediately he recollected his brother Nikolay and how
        hateful he was to have been able to forget him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You wait a bit, wait a bit,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        smiling and touching his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you what I know,
        and I repeat that in this delicate and tender matter, as far as one can
        conjecture, I believe the chances are in your favor.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin dropped back in his chair; his face was pale.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may
        be,&rdquo; pursued Oblonsky, filling up his glass.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, thanks, I can&rsquo;t drink any more,&rdquo; said Levin,
        pushing away his glass. &ldquo;I shall be drunk.... Come, tell me how
        are you getting on?&rdquo; he went on, obviously anxious to change the
        conversation.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;One word more: in any case I advise you to settle the question
        soon. Tonight I don&rsquo;t advise you to speak,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;Go round tomorrow morning, make an offer in due
        form, and God bless you....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, do you still think of coming to me for some shooting? Come
        next spring, do,&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this
        conversation with Stepan Arkadyevitch. A feeling such as his was
        profaned by talk of the rivalry of some Petersburg officer, of the
        suppositions and the counsels of Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled. He knew what was passing in Levin&rsquo;s
        soul.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come some day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But women, my
        boy, they&rsquo;re the pivot everything turns upon. Things are in a bad
        way with me, very bad. And it&rsquo;s all through women. Tell me frankly
        now,&rdquo; he pursued, picking up a cigar and keeping one hand on his
        glass; &ldquo;give me your advice.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, what is it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. Suppose you&rsquo;re married, you love your
        wife, but you&rsquo;re fascinated by another woman....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, but I&rsquo;m absolutely unable to comprehend how ...
        just as I can&rsquo;t comprehend how I could now, after my dinner, go
        straight to a baker&rsquo;s shop and steal a roll.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s eyes sparkled more than usual.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why not? A roll will sometimes smell so good one can&rsquo;t
        resist it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="poem">
        &ldquo;Himmlisch ist&rsquo;s, wenn ich bezwungen<br />
        Meine irdische Begier;<br />
        Aber doch wenn&rsquo;s nich gelungen<br />
        Hatt&rsquo; ich auch recht hübsch Plaisir!&rdquo;<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        As he said this, Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled subtly. Levin, too, could
        not help smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but joking apart,&rdquo; resumed Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        &ldquo;you must understand that the woman is a sweet, gentle loving
        creature, poor and lonely, and has sacrificed everything. Now, when the
        thing&rsquo;s done, don&rsquo;t you see, can one possibly cast her off?
        Even supposing one parts from her, so as not to break up one&rsquo;s
        family life, still, can one help feeling for her, setting her on her
        feet, softening her lot?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you must excuse me there. You know to me all women are
        divided into two classes ... at least no ... truer to say: there are
        women and there are ... I&rsquo;ve never seen exquisite fallen beings,
        and I never shall see them, but such creatures as that painted
        Frenchwoman at the counter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind, and
        all fallen women are the same.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But the Magdalen?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, drop that! Christ would never have said those words if He had
        known how they would be abused. Of all the Gospel those words are the
        only ones remembered. However, I&rsquo;m not saying so much what I
        think, as what I feel. I have a loathing for fallen women. You&rsquo;re
        afraid of spiders, and I of these vermin. Most likely you&rsquo;ve not
        made a study of spiders and don&rsquo;t know their character; and so it
        is with me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very well for you to talk like that; it&rsquo;s very
        much like that gentleman in Dickens who used to fling all difficult
        questions over his right shoulder. But to deny the facts is no answer.
        What&rsquo;s to be done&mdash;you tell me that, what&rsquo;s to be done?
        Your wife gets older, while you&rsquo;re full of life. Before
        you&rsquo;ve time to look round, you feel that you can&rsquo;t love your
        wife with love, however much you may esteem her. And then all at once
        love turns up, and you&rsquo;re done for, done for,&rdquo; Stepan
        Arkadyevitch said with weary despair.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin half smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re done for,&rdquo; resumed Oblonsky. &ldquo;But
        what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t steal rolls.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed outright.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, moralist! But you must understand, there are two women; one
        insists only on her rights, and those rights are your love, which you
        can&rsquo;t give her; and the other sacrifices everything for you and
        asks for nothing. What are you to do? How are you to act? There&rsquo;s
        a fearful tragedy in it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you care for my profession of faith as regards that,
        I&rsquo;ll tell you that I don&rsquo;t believe there was any tragedy
        about it. And this is why. To my mind, love ... both the sorts of love,
        which you remember Plato defines in his Banquet, served as the test of
        men. Some men only understand one sort, and some only the other. And
        those who only know the non-platonic love have no need to talk of
        tragedy. In such love there can be no sort of tragedy. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
        much obliged for the gratification, my humble
        respects&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s all the tragedy. And in platonic love
        there can be no tragedy, because in that love all is clear and pure,
        because....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At that instant Levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he
        had lived through. And he added unexpectedly:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But perhaps you are right. Very likely ... I don&rsquo;t know, I
        don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re very much all of a piece. That&rsquo;s
        your strong point and your failing. You have a character that&rsquo;s
        all of a piece, and you want the whole of life to be of a piece
        too&mdash;but that&rsquo;s not how it is. You despise public official
        work because you want the reality to be invariably corresponding all the
        while with the aim&mdash;and that&rsquo;s not how it is. You want a
        man&rsquo;s work, too, always to have a defined aim, and love and family
        life always to be undivided&mdash;and that&rsquo;s not how it is. All
        the variety, all the charm, all the beauty of life is made up of light
        and shadow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin sighed and made no reply. He was thinking of his own affairs, and
        did not hear Oblonsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        And suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends, though
        they had been dining and drinking together, which should have drawn them
        closer, yet each was thinking only of his own affairs, and they had
        nothing to do with one another. Oblonsky had more than once experienced
        this extreme sense of aloofness, instead of intimacy, coming on after
        dinner, and he knew what to do in such cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Bill!&rdquo; he called, and he went into the next room where he
        promptly came across an aide-de-camp of his acquaintance and dropped
        into conversation with him about an actress and her protector. And at
        once in the conversation with the aide-de-camp Oblonsky had a sense of
        relaxation and relief after the conversation with Levin, which always
        put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the Tatar appeared with a bill for twenty-six roubles and odd
        kopecks, besides a tip for himself, Levin, who would another time have
        been horrified, like anyone from the country, at his share of fourteen
        roubles, did not notice it, paid, and set off homewards to dress and go
        to the Shtcherbatskys&rsquo; there to decide his fate.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 12</h3>

      <p>
        The young Princess Kitty Shtcherbatskaya was eighteen. It was the first
        winter that she had been out in the world. Her success in society had
        been greater than that of either of her elder sisters, and greater even
        than her mother had anticipated. To say nothing of the young men who
        danced at the Moscow balls being almost all in love with Kitty, two
        serious suitors had already this first winter made their appearance:
        Levin, and immediately after his departure, Count Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin&rsquo;s appearance at the beginning of the winter, his frequent
        visits, and evident love for Kitty, had led to the first serious
        conversations between Kitty&rsquo;s parents as to her future, and to
        disputes between them. The prince was on Levin&rsquo;s side; he said he
        wished for nothing better for Kitty. The princess for her part, going
        round the question in the manner peculiar to women, maintained that
        Kitty was too young, that Levin had done nothing to prove that he had
        serious intentions, that Kitty felt no great attraction to him, and
        other side issues; but she did not state the principal point, which was
        that she looked for a better match for her daughter, and that Levin was
        not to her liking, and she did not understand him. When Levin had
        abruptly departed, the princess was delighted, and said to her husband
        triumphantly: &ldquo;You see I was right.&rdquo; When Vronsky appeared
        on the scene, she was still more delighted, confirmed in her opinion
        that Kitty was to make not simply a good, but a brilliant match.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the mother&rsquo;s eyes there could be no comparison between Vronsky
        and Levin. She disliked in Levin his strange and uncompromising opinions
        and his shyness in society, founded, as she supposed, on his pride and
        his queer sort of life, as she considered it, absorbed in cattle and
        peasants. She did not very much like it that he, who was in love with
        her daughter, had kept coming to the house for six weeks, as though he
        were waiting for something, inspecting, as though he were afraid he
        might be doing them too great an honor by making an offer, and did not
        realize that a man, who continually visits at a house where there is a
        young unmarried girl, is bound to make his intentions clear. And
        suddenly, without doing so, he disappeared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as well
        he&rsquo;s not attractive enough for Kitty to have fallen in love with
        him,&rdquo; thought the mother.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky satisfied all the mother&rsquo;s desires. Very wealthy, clever,
        of aristocratic family, on the highroad to a brilliant career in the
        army and at court, and a fascinating man. Nothing better could be wished
        for.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky openly flirted with Kitty at balls, danced with her, and came
        continually to the house, consequently there could be no doubt of the
        seriousness of his intentions. But, in spite of that, the mother had
        spent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and
        agitation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Princess Shtcherbatskaya had herself been married thirty years ago, her
        aunt arranging the match. Her husband, about whom everything was well
        known beforehand, had come, looked at his future bride, and been looked
        at. The matchmaking aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual
        impression. That impression had been favorable. Afterwards, on a day
        fixed beforehand, the expected offer was made to her parents, and
        accepted. All had passed very simply and easily. So it seemed, at least,
        to the princess. But over her own daughters she had felt how far from
        simple and easy is the business, apparently so commonplace, of marrying
        off one&rsquo;s daughters. The panics that had been lived through, the
        thoughts that had been brooded over, the money that had been wasted, and
        the disputes with her husband over marrying the two elder girls, Darya
        and Natalia! Now, since the youngest had come out, she was going through
        the same terrors, the same doubts, and still more violent quarrels with
        her husband than she had over the elder girls. The old prince, like all
        fathers indeed, was exceedingly punctilious on the score of the honor
        and reputation of his daughters. He was irrationally jealous over his
        daughters, especially over Kitty, who was his favorite. At every turn he
        had scenes with the princess for compromising her daughter. The princess
        had grown accustomed to this already with her other daughters, but now
        she felt that there was more ground for the prince&rsquo;s touchiness.
        She saw that of late years much was changed in the manners of society,
        that a mother&rsquo;s duties had become still more difficult. She saw
        that girls of Kitty&rsquo;s age formed some sort of clubs, went to some
        sort of lectures, mixed freely in men&rsquo;s society; drove about the
        streets alone, many of them did not curtsey, and, what was the most
        important thing, all the girls were firmly convinced that to choose
        their husbands was their own affair, and not their parents&rsquo;.
        &ldquo;Marriages aren&rsquo;t made nowadays as they used to be,&rdquo;
        was thought and said by all these young girls, and even by their elders.
        But how marriages were made now, the princess could not learn from
        anyone. The French fashion&mdash;of the parents arranging their
        children&rsquo;s future&mdash;was not accepted; it was condemned. The
        English fashion of the complete independence of girls was also not
        accepted, and not possible in Russian society. The Russian fashion of
        matchmaking by the offices of intermediate persons was for some reason
        considered unseemly; it was ridiculed by everyone, and by the princess
        herself. But how girls were to be married, and how parents were to marry
        them, no one knew. Everyone with whom the princess had chanced to
        discuss the matter said the same thing: &ldquo;Mercy on us, it&rsquo;s
        high time in our day to cast off all that old-fashioned business.
        It&rsquo;s the young people have to marry; and not their parents; and so
        we ought to leave the young people to arrange it as they choose.&rdquo;
        It was very easy for anyone to say that who had no daughters, but the
        princess realized that in the process of getting to know each other, her
        daughter might fall in love, and fall in love with someone who did not
        care to marry her or who was quite unfit to be her husband. And, however
        much it was instilled into the princess that in our times young people
        ought to arrange their lives for themselves, she was unable to believe
        it, just as she would have been unable to believe that, at any time
        whatever, the most suitable playthings for children five years old ought
        to be loaded pistols. And so the princess was more uneasy over Kitty
        than she had been over her elder sisters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now she was afraid that Vronsky might confine himself to simply flirting
        with her daughter. She saw that her daughter was in love with him, but
        tried to comfort herself with the thought that he was an honorable man,
        and would not do this. But at the same time she knew how easy it is,
        with the freedom of manners of today, to turn a girl&rsquo;s head, and
        how lightly men generally regard such a crime. The week before, Kitty
        had told her mother of a conversation she had with Vronsky during a
        mazurka. This conversation had partly reassured the princess; but
        perfectly at ease she could not be. Vronsky had told Kitty that both he
        and his brother were so used to obeying their mother that they never
        made up their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her.
        &ldquo;And just now, I am impatiently awaiting my mother&rsquo;s arrival
        from Petersburg, as peculiarly fortunate,&rdquo; he told her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words.
        But her mother saw them in a different light. She knew that the old lady
        was expected from day to day, that she would be pleased at her
        son&rsquo;s choice, and she felt it strange that he should not make his
        offer through fear of vexing his mother. However, she was so anxious for
        the marriage itself, and still more for relief from her fears, that she
        believed it was so. Bitter as it was for the princess to see the
        unhappiness of her eldest daughter, Dolly, on the point of leaving her
        husband, her anxiety over the decision of her youngest daughter&rsquo;s
        fate engrossed all her feelings. Today, with Levin&rsquo;s reappearance,
        a fresh source of anxiety arose. She was afraid that her daughter, who
        had at one time, as she fancied, a feeling for Levin, might, from
        extreme sense of honor, refuse Vronsky, and that Levin&rsquo;s arrival
        might generally complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, has he been here long?&rdquo; the princess asked about
        Levin, as they returned home.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He came today, mamma.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I want to say....&rdquo; began the
        princess, and from her serious and alert face, Kitty guessed what it
        would be.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; she said, flushing hotly and turning quickly to
        her, &ldquo;please, please don&rsquo;t say anything about that. I know,
        I know all about it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She wished for what her mother wished for, but the motives of her
        mother&rsquo;s wishes wounded her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I only want to say that to raise hopes....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mamma, darling, for goodness&rsquo; sake, don&rsquo;t talk about
        it. It&rsquo;s so horrible to talk about it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said her mother, seeing the tears in her
        daughter&rsquo;s eyes; &ldquo;but one thing, my love; you promised me
        you would have no secrets from me. You won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Never, mamma, none,&rdquo; answered Kitty, flushing a little, and
        looking her mother straight in the face, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s no use
        in my telling you anything, and I ... I ... if I wanted to, I
        don&rsquo;t know what to say or how.... I don&rsquo;t know....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, she could not tell an untruth with those eyes,&rdquo; thought
        the mother, smiling at her agitation and happiness. The princess smiled
        that what was taking place just now in her soul seemed to the poor child
        so immense and so important.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 13</h3>

      <p>
        After dinner, and till the beginning of the evening, Kitty was feeling a
        sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle. Her
        heart throbbed violently, and her thoughts would not rest on anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        She felt that this evening, when they would both meet for the first
        time, would be a turning point in her life. And she was continually
        picturing them to herself, at one moment each separately, and then both
        together. When she mused on the past, she dwelt with pleasure, with
        tenderness, on the memories of her relations with Levin. The memories of
        childhood and of Levin&rsquo;s friendship with her dead brother gave a
        special poetic charm to her relations with him. His love for her, of
        which she felt certain, was flattering and delightful to her; and it was
        pleasant for her to think of Levin. In her memories of Vronsky there
        always entered a certain element of awkwardness, though he was in the
        highest degree well-bred and at ease, as though there were some false
        note&mdash;not in Vronsky, he was very simple and nice, but in herself,
        while with Levin she felt perfectly simple and clear. But, on the other
        hand, directly she thought of the future with Vronsky, there arose
        before her a perspective of brilliant happiness; with Levin the future
        seemed misty.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she went upstairs to dress, and looked into the looking-glass, she
        noticed with joy that it was one of her good days, and that she was in
        complete possession of all her forces,&mdash;she needed this so for what
        lay before her: she was conscious of external composure and free grace
        in her movements.
      </p>

      <p>
        At half-past seven she had only just gone down into the drawing-room,
        when the footman announced, &ldquo;Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin.&rdquo;
        The princess was still in her room, and the prince had not come in.
        &ldquo;So it is to be,&rdquo; thought Kitty, and all the blood seemed to
        rush to her heart. She was horrified at her paleness, as she glanced
        into the looking-glass. At that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had
        come early on purpose to find her alone and to make her an offer. And
        only then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new,
        different aspect; only then she realized that the question did not
        affect her only&mdash;with whom she would be happy, and whom she
        loved&mdash;but that she would have that moment to wound a man whom she
        liked. And to wound him cruelly. What for? Because he, dear fellow,
        loved her, was in love with her. But there was no help for it, so it
        must be, so it would have to be.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My God! shall I myself really have to say it to him?&rdquo; she
        thought. &ldquo;Can I tell him I don&rsquo;t love him? That will be a
        lie. What am I to say to him? That I love someone else? No, that&rsquo;s
        impossible. I&rsquo;m going away, I&rsquo;m going away.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She had reached the door, when she heard his step. &ldquo;No! it&rsquo;s
        not honest. What have I to be afraid of? I have done nothing wrong. What
        is to be, will be! I&rsquo;ll tell the truth. And with him one
        can&rsquo;t be ill at ease. Here he is,&rdquo; she said to herself,
        seeing his powerful, shy figure, with his shining eyes fixed on her. She
        looked straight into his face, as though imploring him to spare her, and
        gave her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not time yet; I think I&rsquo;m too early,&rdquo; he
        said glancing round the empty drawing-room. When he saw that his
        expectations were realized, that there was nothing to prevent him from
        speaking, his face became gloomy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Kitty, and sat down at the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But this was just what I wanted, to find you alone,&rdquo; he
        began, not sitting down, and not looking at her, so as not to lose
        courage.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mamma will be down directly. She was very much tired....
        Yesterday....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She talked on, not knowing what her lips were uttering, and not taking
        her supplicating and caressing eyes off him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He glanced at her; she blushed, and ceased speaking.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I told you I did not know whether I should be here long ... that
        it depended on you....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She dropped her head lower and lower, not knowing herself what answer
        she should make to what was coming.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That it depended on you,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I meant to
        say ... I meant to say ... I came for this ... to be my wife!&rdquo; he
        brought out, not knowing what he was saying; but feeling that the most
        terrible thing was said, he stopped short and looked at her....
      </p>

      <p>
        She was breathing heavily, not looking at him. She was feeling ecstasy.
        Her soul was flooded with happiness. She had never anticipated that the
        utterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her. But it
        lasted only an instant. She remembered Vronsky. She lifted her clear,
        truthful eyes, and seeing his desperate face, she answered hastily:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That cannot be ... forgive me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        A moment ago, and how close she had been to him, of what importance in
        his life! And how aloof and remote from him she had become now!
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It was bound to be so,&rdquo; he said, not looking at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        He bowed, and was meaning to retreat.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 14</h3>

      <p>
        But at that very moment the princess came in. There was a look of horror
        on her face when she saw them alone, and their disturbed faces. Levin
        bowed to her, and said nothing. Kitty did not speak nor lift her eyes.
        &ldquo;Thank God, she has refused him,&rdquo; thought the mother, and
        her face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her
        guests on Thursdays. She sat down and began questioning Levin about his
        life in the country. He sat down again, waiting for other visitors to
        arrive, in order to retreat unnoticed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Five minutes later there came in a friend of Kitty&rsquo;s, married the
        preceding winter, Countess Nordston.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was a thin, sallow, sickly, and nervous woman, with brilliant black
        eyes. She was fond of Kitty, and her affection for her showed itself, as
        the affection of married women for girls always does, in the desire to
        make a match for Kitty after her own ideal of married happiness; she
        wanted her to marry Vronsky. Levin she had often met at the
        Shtcherbatskys&rsquo; early in the winter, and she had always disliked
        him. Her invariable and favorite pursuit, when they met, consisted in
        making fun of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his
        grandeur, or breaks off his learned conversation with me because
        I&rsquo;m a fool, or is condescending to me. I like that so; to see him
        condescending! I am so glad he can&rsquo;t bear me,&rdquo; she used to
        say of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was right, for Levin actually could not bear her, and despised her
        for what she was proud of and regarded as a fine
        characteristic&mdash;her nervousness, her delicate contempt and
        indifference for everything coarse and earthly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Countess Nordston and Levin got into that relation with one another
        not seldom seen in society, when two persons, who remain externally on
        friendly terms, despise each other to such a degree that they cannot
        even take each other seriously, and cannot even be offended by each
        other.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Countess Nordston pounced upon Levin at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, Konstantin Dmitrievitch! So you&rsquo;ve come back to our
        corrupt Babylon,&rdquo; she said, giving him her tiny, yellow hand, and
        recalling what he had chanced to say early in the winter, that Moscow
        was a Babylon. &ldquo;Come, is Babylon reformed, or have you
        degenerated?&rdquo; she added, glancing with a simper at Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very flattering for me, countess, that you remember my
        words so well,&rdquo; responded Levin, who had succeeded in recovering
        his composure, and at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking
        hostility to the Countess Nordston. &ldquo;They must certainly make a
        great impression on you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I should think so! I always note them all down. Well, Kitty,
        have you been skating again?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And she began talking to Kitty. Awkward as it was for Levin to withdraw
        now, it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this
        awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see Kitty, who glanced at
        him now and then and avoided his eyes. He was on the point of getting
        up, when the princess, noticing that he was silent, addressed him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall you be long in Moscow? You&rsquo;re busy with the district
        council, though, aren&rsquo;t you, and can&rsquo;t be away for
        long?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, princess, I&rsquo;m no longer a member of the council,&rdquo;
        he said. &ldquo;I have come up for a few days.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something the matter with him,&rdquo; thought
        Countess Nordston, glancing at his stern, serious face. &ldquo;He
        isn&rsquo;t in his old argumentative mood. But I&rsquo;ll draw him out.
        I do love making a fool of him before Kitty, and I&rsquo;ll do
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Konstantin Dmitrievitch,&rdquo; she said to him, &ldquo;do
        explain to me, please, what&rsquo;s the meaning of it. You know all
        about such things. At home in our village of Kaluga all the peasants and
        all the women have drunk up all they possessed, and now they can&rsquo;t
        pay us any rent. What&rsquo;s the meaning of that? You always praise the
        peasants so.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At that instant another lady came into the room, and Levin got up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, countess, but I really know nothing about it, and
        can&rsquo;t tell you anything,&rdquo; he said, and looked round at the
        officer who came in behind the lady.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That must be Vronsky,&rdquo; thought Levin, and, to be sure of
        it, glanced at Kitty. She had already had time to look at Vronsky, and
        looked round at Levin. And simply from the look in her eyes, that grew
        unconsciously brighter, Levin knew that she loved that man, knew it as
        surely as if she had told him so in words. But what sort of a man was
        he? Now, whether for good or for ill, Levin could not choose but remain;
        he must find out what the man was like whom she loved.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are people who, on meeting a successful rival, no matter in what,
        are at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him, and
        to see only what is bad. There are people, on the other hand, who desire
        above all to find in that lucky rival the qualities by which he has
        outstripped them, and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what is
        good. Levin belonged to the second class. But he had no difficulty in
        finding what was good and attractive in Vronsky. It was apparent at the
        first glance. Vronsky was a squarely built, dark man, not very tall,
        with a good-humored, handsome, and exceedingly calm and resolute face.
        Everything about his face and figure, from his short-cropped black hair
        and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting, brand-new uniform,
        was simple and at the same time elegant. Making way for the lady who had
        come in, Vronsky went up to the princess and then to Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he approached her, his beautiful eyes shone with a specially tender
        light, and with a faint, happy, and modestly triumphant smile (so it
        seemed to Levin), bowing carefully and respectfully over her, he held
        out his small broad hand to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Greeting and saying a few words to everyone, he sat down without once
        glancing at Levin, who had never taken his eyes off him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let me introduce you,&rdquo; said the princess, indicating Levin.
        &ldquo;Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, Count Alexey Kirillovitch
        Vronsky.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky got up and, looking cordially at Levin, shook hands with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I believe I was to have dined with you this winter,&rdquo; he
        said, smiling his simple and open smile; &ldquo;but you had unexpectedly
        left for the country.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Konstantin Dmitrievitch despises and hates town and us
        townspeople,&rdquo; said Countess Nordston.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My words must make a deep impression on you, since you remember
        them so well,&rdquo; said Levin, and, suddenly conscious that he had
        said just the same thing before, he reddened.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky looked at Levin and Countess Nordston, and smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you always in the country?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;I
        should think it must be dull in the winter.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not dull if one has work to do; besides, one&rsquo;s
        not dull by oneself,&rdquo; Levin replied abruptly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am fond of the country,&rdquo; said Vronsky, noticing, and
        affecting not to notice, Levin&rsquo;s tone.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I hope, count, you would not consent to live in the country
        always,&rdquo; said Countess Nordston.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I have never tried for long. I experienced a
        queer feeling once,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I never longed so for the
        country, Russian country, with bast shoes and peasants, as when I was
        spending a winter with my mother in Nice. Nice itself is dull enough,
        you know. And indeed, Naples and Sorrento are only pleasant for a short
        time. And it&rsquo;s just there that Russia comes back to me most
        vividly, and especially the country. It&rsquo;s as though....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He talked on, addressing both Kitty and Levin, turning his serene,
        friendly eyes from one to the other, and saying obviously just what came
        into his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Noticing that Countess Nordston wanted to say something, he stopped
        short without finishing what he had begun, and listened attentively to
        her.
      </p>

      <p>
        The conversation did not flag for an instant, so that the princess, who
        always kept in reserve, in case a subject should be lacking, two heavy
        guns&mdash;the relative advantages of classical and of modern education,
        and universal military service&mdash;had not to move out either of them,
        while Countess Nordston had not a chance of chaffing Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin wanted to, and could not, take part in the general conversation;
        saying to himself every instant, &ldquo;Now go,&rdquo; he still did not
        go, as though waiting for something.
      </p>

      <p>
        The conversation fell upon table-turning and spirits, and Countess
        Nordston, who believed in spiritualism, began to describe the marvels
        she had seen.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, countess, you really must take me, for pity&rsquo;s sake do
        take me to see them! I have never seen anything extraordinary, though I
        am always on the lookout for it everywhere,&rdquo; said Vronsky,
        smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, next Saturday,&rdquo; answered Countess Nordston.
        &ldquo;But you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, do you believe in it?&rdquo;
        she asked Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why do you ask me? You know what I shall say.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I want to hear your opinion.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My opinion,&rdquo; answered Levin, &ldquo;is only that this
        table-turning simply proves that educated society&mdash;so
        called&mdash;is no higher than the peasants. They believe in the evil
        eye, and in witchcraft and omens, while we....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, then you don&rsquo;t believe in it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe in it, countess.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But if I&rsquo;ve seen it myself?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The peasant women too tell us they have seen goblins.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you think I tell a lie?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And she laughed a mirthless laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, Masha, Konstantin Dmitrievitch said he could not believe
        in it,&rdquo; said Kitty, blushing for Levin, and Levin saw this, and,
        still more exasperated, would have answered, but Vronsky with his bright
        frank smile rushed to the support of the conversation, which was
        threatening to become disagreeable.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You do not admit the conceivability at all?&rdquo; he queried.
        &ldquo;But why not? We admit the existence of electricity, of which we
        know nothing. Why should there not be some new force, still unknown to
        us, which....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;When electricity was discovered,&rdquo; Levin interrupted
        hurriedly, &ldquo;it was only the phenomenon that was discovered, and it
        was unknown from what it proceeded and what were its effects, and ages
        passed before its applications were conceived. But the spiritualists
        have begun with tables writing for them, and spirits appearing to them,
        and have only later started saying that it is an unknown force.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky listened attentively to Levin, as he always did listen,
        obviously interested in his words.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but the spiritualists say we don&rsquo;t know at present
        what this force is, but there is a force, and these are the conditions
        in which it acts. Let the scientific men find out what the force
        consists in. No, I don&rsquo;t see why there should not be a new force,
        if it....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, because with electricity,&rdquo; Levin interrupted again,
        &ldquo;every time you rub tar against wool, a recognized phenomenon is
        manifested, but in this case it does not happen every time, and so it
        follows it is not a natural phenomenon.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious for
        a drawing-room, Vronsky made no rejoinder, but by way of trying to
        change the conversation, he smiled brightly, and turned to the ladies.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do let us try at once, countess,&rdquo; he said; but Levin would
        finish saying what he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that this attempt of the
        spiritualists to explain their marvels as some sort of new natural force
        is most futile. They boldly talk of spiritual force, and then try to
        subject it to material experiment.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone was waiting for him to finish, and he felt it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And I think you would be a first-rate medium,&rdquo; said
        Countess Nordston; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something enthusiastic in
        you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin opened his mouth, was about to say something, reddened, and said
        nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do let us try table-turning at once, please,&rdquo; said Vronsky.
        &ldquo;Princess, will you allow it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Vronsky stood up, looking for a little table.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty got up to fetch a table, and as she passed, her eyes met
        Levin&rsquo;s. She felt for him with her whole heart, the more because
        she was pitying him for suffering of which she was herself the cause.
        &ldquo;If you can forgive me, forgive me,&rdquo; said her eyes, &ldquo;I
        am so happy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I hate them all, and you, and myself,&rdquo; his eyes responded,
        and he took up his hat. But he was not destined to escape. Just as they
        were arranging themselves round the table, and Levin was on the point of
        retiring, the old prince came in, and after greeting the ladies,
        addressed Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he began joyously. &ldquo;Been here long, my boy? I
        didn&rsquo;t even know you were in town. Very glad to see you.&rdquo;
        The old prince embraced Levin, and talking to him did not observe
        Vronsky, who had risen, and was serenely waiting till the prince should
        turn to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty felt how distasteful her father&rsquo;s warmth was to Levin after
        what had happened. She saw, too, how coldly her father responded at last
        to Vronsky&rsquo;s bow, and how Vronsky looked with amiable perplexity
        at her father, as though trying and failing to understand how and why
        anyone could be hostilely disposed towards him, and she flushed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Prince, let us have Konstantin Dmitrievitch,&rdquo; said Countess
        Nordston; &ldquo;we want to try an experiment.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What experiment? Table-turning? Well, you must excuse me, ladies
        and gentlemen, but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring
        game,&rdquo; said the old prince, looking at Vronsky, and guessing that
        it had been his suggestion. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some sense in that,
        anyway.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his resolute eyes, and,
        with a faint smile, began immediately talking to Countess Nordston of
        the great ball that was to come off next week.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I hope you will be there?&rdquo; he said to Kitty. As soon as the
        old prince turned away from him, Levin went out unnoticed, and the last
        impression he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling,
        happy face of Kitty answering Vronsky&rsquo;s inquiry about the ball.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 15</h3>

      <p>
        At the end of the evening Kitty told her mother of her conversation with
        Levin, and in spite of all the pity she felt for Levin, she was glad at
        the thought that she had received an <i>offer</i>. She had no doubt that
        she had acted rightly. But after she had gone to bed, for a long while
        she could not sleep. One impression pursued her relentlessly. It was
        Levin&rsquo;s face, with his scowling brows, and his kind eyes looking
        out in dark dejection below them, as he stood listening to her father,
        and glancing at her and at Vronsky. And she felt so sorry for him that
        tears came into her eyes. But immediately she thought of the man for
        whom she had given him up. She vividly recalled his manly, resolute
        face, his noble self-possession, and the good nature conspicuous in
        everything towards everyone. She remembered the love for her of the man
        she loved, and once more all was gladness in her soul, and she lay on
        the pillow, smiling with happiness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m
        sorry; but what could I do? It&rsquo;s not my fault,&rdquo; she said to
        herself; but an inner voice told her something else. Whether she felt
        remorse at having won Levin&rsquo;s love, or at having refused him, she
        did not know. But her happiness was poisoned by doubts. &ldquo;Lord,
        have pity on us; Lord, have pity on us; Lord, have pity on us!&rdquo;
        she repeated to herself, till she fell asleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile there took place below, in the prince&rsquo;s little library,
        one of the scenes so often repeated between the parents on account of
        their favorite daughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What? I&rsquo;ll tell you what!&rdquo; shouted the prince, waving
        his arms, and at once wrapping his squirrel-lined dressing-gown round
        him again. &ldquo;That you&rsquo;ve no pride, no dignity; that
        you&rsquo;re disgracing, ruining your daughter by this vulgar, stupid
        matchmaking!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But, really, for mercy&rsquo;s sake, prince, what have I
        done?&rdquo; said the princess, almost crying.
      </p>

      <p>
        She, pleased and happy after her conversation with her daughter, had
        gone to the prince to say good-night as usual, and though she had no
        intention of telling him of Levin&rsquo;s offer and Kitty&rsquo;s
        refusal, still she hinted to her husband that she fancied things were
        practically settled with Vronsky, and that he would declare himself so
        soon as his mother arrived. And thereupon, at those words, the prince
        had all at once flown into a passion, and began to use unseemly
        language.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What have you done? I&rsquo;ll tell you what. First of all,
        you&rsquo;re trying to catch an eligible gentleman, and all Moscow will
        be talking of it, and with good reason. If you have evening parties,
        invite everyone, don&rsquo;t pick out the possible suitors. Invite all
        the young bucks. Engage a piano player, and let them dance, and not as
        you do things nowadays, hunting up good matches. It makes me sick, sick
        to see it, and you&rsquo;ve gone on till you&rsquo;ve turned the poor
        wench&rsquo;s head. Levin&rsquo;s a thousand times the better man. As
        for this little Petersburg swell, they&rsquo;re turned out by machinery,
        all on one pattern, and all precious rubbish. But if he were a prince of
        the blood, my daughter need not run after anyone.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what have I done?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve....&rdquo; The prince was crying wrathfully.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know if one were to listen to you,&rdquo; interrupted the
        princess, &ldquo;we should never marry our daughter. If it&rsquo;s to be
        so, we&rsquo;d better go into the country.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and we had better.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But do wait a minute. Do I try and catch them? I don&rsquo;t try
        to catch them in the least. A young man, and a very nice one, has fallen
        in love with her, and she, I fancy....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, you fancy! And how if she really is in love, and
        he&rsquo;s no more thinking of marriage than I am!... Oh, that I should
        live to see it! Ah! spiritualism! Ah! Nice! Ah! the ball!&rdquo; And the
        prince, imagining that he was mimicking his wife, made a mincing curtsey
        at each word. &ldquo;And this is how we&rsquo;re preparing wretchedness
        for Kitty; and she&rsquo;s really got the notion into her
        head....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what makes you suppose so?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose; I know. We have eyes for such things,
        though women-folk haven&rsquo;t. I see a man who has serious intentions,
        that&rsquo;s Levin: and I see a peacock, like this feather-head,
        who&rsquo;s only amusing himself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, when once you get an idea into your head!...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll remember my words, but too late, just as with
        Dolly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, well, we won&rsquo;t talk of it,&rdquo; the princess
        stopped him, recollecting her unlucky Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;By all means, and good-night!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And signing each other with the cross, the husband and wife parted with
        a kiss, feeling that they each remained of their own opinion.
      </p>

      <p>
        The princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had
        settled Kitty&rsquo;s future, and that there could be no doubt of
        Vronsky&rsquo;s intentions, but her husband&rsquo;s words had disturbed
        her. And returning to her own room, in terror before the unknown future,
        she, too, like Kitty, repeated several times in her heart, &ldquo;Lord,
        have pity; Lord, have pity; Lord, have pity.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 16</h3>

      <p>
        Vronsky had never had a real home life. His mother had been in her youth
        a brilliant society woman, who had had during her married life, and
        still more afterwards, many love affairs notorious in the whole
        fashionable world. His father he scarcely remembered, and he had been
        educated in the Corps of Pages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer, he had at once got
        into the circle of wealthy Petersburg army men. Although he did go more
        or less into Petersburg society, his love affairs had always hitherto
        been outside it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Moscow he had for the first time felt, after his luxurious and coarse
        life at Petersburg, all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and innocent
        girl of his own rank, who cared for him. It never even entered his head
        that there could be any harm in his relations with Kitty. At balls he
        danced principally with her. He was a constant visitor at their house.
        He talked to her as people commonly do talk in society&mdash;all sorts
        of nonsense, but nonsense to which he could not help attaching a special
        meaning in her case. Although he said nothing to her that he could not
        have said before everybody, he felt that she was becoming more and more
        dependent upon him, and the more he felt this, the better he liked it,
        and the tenderer was his feeling for her. He did not know that his mode
        of behavior in relation to Kitty had a definite character, that it is
        courting young girls with no intention of marriage, and that such
        courting is one of the evil actions common among brilliant young men
        such as he was. It seemed to him that he was the first who had
        discovered this pleasure, and he was enjoying his discovery.
      </p>

      <p>
        If he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening, if he
        could have put himself at the point of view of the family and have heard
        that Kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her, he would have been
        greatly astonished, and would not have believed it. He could not believe
        that what gave such great and delicate pleasure to him, and above all to
        her, could be wrong. Still less could he have believed that he ought to
        marry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility. He not only
        disliked family life, but a family, and especially a husband was, in
        accordance with the views general in the bachelor world in which he
        lived, conceived as something alien, repellant, and, above all,
        ridiculous.
      </p>

      <p>
        But though Vronsky had not the least suspicion what the parents were
        saying, he felt on coming away from the Shtcherbatskys&rsquo; that the
        secret spiritual bond which existed between him and Kitty had grown so
        much stronger that evening that some step must be taken. But what step
        could and ought to be taken he could not imagine.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is so exquisite,&rdquo; he thought, as he returned from the
        Shtcherbatskys&rsquo;, carrying away with him, as he always did, a
        delicious feeling of purity and freshness, arising partly from the fact
        that he had not been smoking for a whole evening, and with it a new
        feeling of tenderness at her love for him&mdash;&ldquo;what is so
        exquisite is that not a word has been said by me or by her, but we
        understand each other so well in this unseen language of looks and
        tones, that this evening more clearly than ever she told me she loves
        me. And how secretly, simply, and most of all, how trustfully! I feel
        myself better, purer. I feel that I have a heart, and that there is a
        great deal of good in me. Those sweet, loving eyes! When she said:
        &lsquo;Indeed I do....&rsquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what then? Oh, nothing. It&rsquo;s good for me, and good
        for her.&rdquo; And he began wondering where to finish the evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        He passed in review of the places he might go to. &ldquo;Club? a game of
        bezique, champagne with Ignatov? No, I&rsquo;m not going.
        <i>Château des Fleurs</i>; there I shall find Oblonsky, songs, the
        cancan. No, I&rsquo;m sick of it. That&rsquo;s why I like the
        Shtcherbatskys&rsquo;, that I&rsquo;m growing better. I&rsquo;ll go
        home.&rdquo; He went straight to his room at Dussots&rsquo; Hotel,
        ordered supper, and then undressed, and as soon as his head touched the
        pillow, fell into a sound sleep.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 17</h3>

      <p>
        Next day at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning Vronsky drove to the
        station of the Petersburg railway to meet his mother, and the first
        person he came across on the great flight of steps was Oblonsky, who was
        expecting his sister by the same train.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! your excellency!&rdquo; cried Oblonsky, &ldquo;whom are you
        meeting?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My mother,&rdquo; Vronsky responded, smiling, as everyone did who
        met Oblonsky. He shook hands with him, and together they ascended the
        steps. &ldquo;She is to be here from Petersburg today.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I was looking out for you till two o&rsquo;clock last night.
        Where did you go after the Shtcherbatskys&rsquo;?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; answered Vronsky. &ldquo;I must own I felt so well
        content yesterday after the Shtcherbatskys&rsquo; that I didn&rsquo;t
        care to go anywhere.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="poem">
        &ldquo;I know a gallant steed by tokens sure,<br />
        And by his eyes I know a youth in love,&rdquo;<br />
      </p>

      <p class="noindent">
        declaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch, just as he had done before to Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky smiled with a look that seemed to say that he did not deny it,
        but he promptly changed the subject.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And whom are you meeting?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I? I&rsquo;ve come to meet a pretty woman,&rdquo; said Oblonsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;<i>Honi soit qui mal y pense!</i> My sister Anna.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s Madame Karenina,&rdquo; said Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You know her, no doubt?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think I do. Or perhaps not ... I really am not sure,&rdquo;
        Vronsky answered heedlessly, with a vague recollection of something
        stiff and tedious evoked by the name Karenina.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But Alexey Alexandrovitch, my celebrated brother-in-law, you
        surely must know. All the world knows him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know him by reputation and by sight. I know that he&rsquo;s
        clever, learned, religious somewhat.... But you know that&rsquo;s not
        ... <i>not in my line,</i>&rdquo; said Vronsky in English.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s a very remarkable man; rather a conservative, but
        a splendid man,&rdquo; observed Stepan Arkadyevitch, &ldquo;a splendid
        man.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, so much the better for him,&rdquo; said Vronsky
        smiling. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; he said, addressing a tall
        old footman of his mother&rsquo;s, standing at the door; &ldquo;come
        here.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides the charm Oblonsky had in general for everyone, Vronsky had felt
        of late specially drawn to him by the fact that in his imagination he
        was associated with Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what do you say? Shall we give a supper on Sunday for the
        <i>diva?</i>&rdquo; he said to him with a smile, taking his arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;m collecting subscriptions. Oh, did you make
        the acquaintance of my friend Levin?&rdquo; asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but he left rather early.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a capital fellow,&rdquo; pursued Oblonsky.
        &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it is,&rdquo; responded Vronsky, &ldquo;in
        all Moscow people&mdash;present company of course excepted,&rdquo; he
        put in jestingly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something uncompromising. They
        are all on the defensive, lose their tempers, as though they all want to
        make one feel something....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true, it is so,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, laughing good-humoredly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Will the train soon be in?&rdquo; Vronsky asked a railway
        official.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The train&rsquo;s signaled,&rdquo; answered the man.
      </p>

      <p>
        The approach of the train was more and more evident by the preparatory
        bustle in the station, the rush of porters, the movement of policemen
        and attendants, and people meeting the train. Through the frosty vapor
        could be seen workmen in short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing
        the rails of the curving line. The hiss of the boiler could be heard on
        the distant rails, and the rumble of something heavy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who felt a great inclination
        to tell Vronsky of Levin&rsquo;s intentions in regard to Kitty.
        &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ve not got a true impression of Levin. He&rsquo;s a
        very nervous man, and is sometimes out of humor, it&rsquo;s true, but
        then he is often very nice. He&rsquo;s such a true, honest nature, and a
        heart of gold. But yesterday there were special reasons,&rdquo; pursued
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, with a meaning smile, totally oblivious of the
        genuine sympathy he had felt the day before for his friend, and feeling
        the same sympathy now, only for Vronsky. &ldquo;Yes, there were reasons
        why he could not help being either particularly happy or particularly
        unhappy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky stood still and asked directly: &ldquo;How so? Do you mean he
        made your
        <i>belle-sœur</i> an offer yesterday?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;I fancied
        something of the sort yesterday. Yes, if he went away early, and was out
        of humor too, it must mean it.... He&rsquo;s been so long in love, and
        I&rsquo;m very sorry for him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it! I should imagine, though, she might reckon on
        a better match,&rdquo; said Vronsky, drawing himself up and walking
        about again, &ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t know him, of course,&rdquo; he
        added. &ldquo;Yes, that is a hateful position! That&rsquo;s why most
        fellows prefer to have to do with Klaras. If you don&rsquo;t succeed
        with them it only proves that you&rsquo;ve not enough cash, but in this
        case one&rsquo;s dignity&rsquo;s at stake. But here&rsquo;s the
        train.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The engine had already whistled in the distance. A few instants later
        the platform was quivering, and with puffs of steam hanging low in the
        air from the frost, the engine rolled up, with the lever of the middle
        wheel rhythmically moving up and down, and the stooping figure of the
        engine-driver covered with frost. Behind the tender, setting the
        platform more and more slowly swaying, came the luggage van with a dog
        whining in it. At last the passenger carriages rolled in, oscillating
        before coming to a standstill.
      </p>

      <p>
        A smart guard jumped out, giving a whistle, and after him one by one the
        impatient passengers began to get down: an officer of the guards,
        holding himself erect, and looking severely about him; a nimble little
        merchant with a satchel, smiling gaily; a peasant with a sack over his
        shoulder.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky, standing beside Oblonsky, watched the carriages and the
        passengers, totally oblivious of his mother. What he had just heard
        about Kitty excited and delighted him. Unconsciously he arched his
        chest, and his eyes flashed. He felt himself a conqueror.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Countess Vronskaya is in that compartment,&rdquo; said the smart
        guard, going up to Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        The guard&rsquo;s words roused him, and forced him to think of his
        mother and his approaching meeting with her. He did not in his heart
        respect his mother, and without acknowledging it to himself, he did not
        love her, though in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he
        lived, and with his own education, he could not have conceived of any
        behavior to his mother not in the highest degree respectful and
        obedient, and the more externally obedient and respectful his behavior,
        the less in his heart he respected and loved her.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 18</h3>

      <p>
        Vronsky followed the guard to the carriage, and at the door of the
        compartment he stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting
        out.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the insight of a man of the world, from one glance at this
        lady&rsquo;s appearance Vronsky classified her as belonging to the best
        society. He begged pardon, and was getting into the carriage, but felt
        he must glance at her once more; not that she was very beautiful, not on
        account of the elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her
        whole figure, but because in the expression of her charming face, as she
        passed close by him, there was something peculiarly caressing and soft.
        As he looked round, she too turned her head. Her shining gray eyes, that
        looked dark from the thick lashes, rested with friendly attention on his
        face, as though she were recognizing him, and then promptly turned away
        to the passing crowd, as though seeking someone. In that brief look
        Vronsky had time to notice the suppressed eagerness which played over
        her face, and flitted between the brilliant eyes and the faint smile
        that curved her red lips. It was as though her nature were so brimming
        over with something that against her will it showed itself now in the
        flash of her eyes, and now in her smile. Deliberately she shrouded the
        light in her eyes, but it shone against her will in the faintly
        perceptible smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky stepped into the carriage. His mother, a dried-up old lady with
        black eyes and ringlets, screwed up her eyes, scanning her son, and
        smiled slightly with her thin lips. Getting up from the seat and handing
        her maid a bag, she gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to kiss,
        and lifting his head from her hand, kissed him on the cheek.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You got my telegram? Quite well? Thank God.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You had a good journey?&rdquo; said her son, sitting down beside
        her, and involuntarily listening to a woman&rsquo;s voice outside the
        door. He knew it was the voice of the lady he had met at the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All the same I don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; said the
        lady&rsquo;s voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Petersburg view, madame.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not Petersburg, but simply feminine,&rdquo; she responded.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, well, allow me to kiss your hand.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Good-bye, Ivan Petrovitch. And could you see if my brother is
        here, and send him to me?&rdquo; said the lady in the doorway, and
        stepped back again into the compartment.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, have you found your brother?&rdquo; said Countess
        Vronskaya, addressing the lady.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky understood now that this was Madame Karenina.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Your brother is here,&rdquo; he said, standing up. &ldquo;Excuse
        me, I did not know you, and, indeed, our acquaintance was so
        slight,&rdquo; said Vronsky, bowing, &ldquo;that no doubt you do not
        remember me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I should have known you because
        your mother and I have been talking, I think, of nothing but you all the
        way.&rdquo; As she spoke she let the eagerness that would insist on
        coming out show itself in her smile. &ldquo;And still no sign of my
        brother.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do call him, Alexey,&rdquo; said the old countess. Vronsky
        stepped out onto the platform and shouted:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oblonsky! Here!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Madame Karenina, however, did not wait for her brother, but catching
        sight of him she stepped out with her light, resolute step. And as soon
        as her brother had reached her, with a gesture that struck Vronsky by
        its decision and its grace, she flung her left arm around his neck, drew
        him rapidly to her, and kissed him warmly. Vronsky gazed, never taking
        his eyes from her, and smiled, he could not have said why. But
        recollecting that his mother was waiting for him, he went back again
        into the carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s very sweet, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said the countess
        of Madame Karenina. &ldquo;Her husband put her with me, and I was
        delighted to have her. We&rsquo;ve been talking all the way. And so you,
        I hear ...
        <i>vous filez le parfait amour. Tant mieux, mon cher, tant mieux.</i
        >&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are referring to, maman,&rdquo; he
        answered coldly. &ldquo;Come, maman, let us go.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Madame Karenina entered the carriage again to say good-bye to the
        countess.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, countess, you have met your son, and I my brother,&rdquo;
        she said. &ldquo;And all my gossip is exhausted. I should have nothing
        more to tell you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the countess, taking her hand. &ldquo;I could
        go all around the world with you and never be dull. You are one of those
        delightful women in whose company it&rsquo;s sweet to be silent as well
        as to talk. Now please don&rsquo;t fret over your son; you can&rsquo;t
        expect never to be parted.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Madame Karenina stood quite still, holding herself very erect, and her
        eyes were smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna Arkadyevna,&rdquo; the countess said in explanation to her
        son, &ldquo;has a little son eight years old, I believe, and she has
        never been parted from him before, and she keeps fretting over leaving
        him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, the countess and I have been talking all the time, I of my
        son and she of hers,&rdquo; said Madame Karenina, and again a smile
        lighted up her face, a caressing smile intended for him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored,&rdquo; he
        said, promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him. But
        apparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain,
        and she turned to the old countess.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you so much. The time has passed so quickly. Good-bye,
        countess.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Good-bye, my love,&rdquo; answered the countess. &ldquo;Let me
        have a kiss of your pretty face. I speak plainly, at my age, and I tell
        you simply that I&rsquo;ve lost my heart to you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stereotyped as the phrase was, Madame Karenina obviously believed it and
        was delighted by it. She flushed, bent down slightly, and put her cheek
        to the countess&rsquo;s lips, drew herself up again, and with the same
        smile fluttering between her lips and her eyes, she gave her hand to
        Vronsky. He pressed the little hand she gave him, and was delighted, as
        though at something special, by the energetic squeeze with which she
        freely and vigorously shook his hand. She went out with the rapid step
        which bore her rather fully-developed figure with such strange
        lightness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very charming,&rdquo; said the countess.
      </p>

      <p>
        That was just what her son was thinking. His eyes followed her till her
        graceful figure was out of sight, and then the smile remained on his
        face. He saw out of the window how she went up to her brother, put her
        arm in his, and began telling him something eagerly, obviously something
        that had nothing to do with him, Vronsky, and at that he felt annoyed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, maman, are you perfectly well?&rdquo; he repeated, turning
        to his mother.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Everything has been delightful. Alexander has been very good, and
        Marie has grown very pretty. She&rsquo;s very interesting.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And she began telling him again of what interested her most&mdash;the
        christening of her grandson, for which she had been staying in
        Petersburg, and the special favor shown her elder son by the Tsar.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Lavrenty,&rdquo; said Vronsky, looking out of the
        window; &ldquo;now we can go, if you like.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The old butler, who had traveled with the countess, came to the carriage
        to announce that everything was ready, and the countess got up to go.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come; there&rsquo;s not such a crowd now,&rdquo; said Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        The maid took a handbag and the lap dog, the butler and a porter the
        other baggage. Vronsky gave his mother his arm; but just as they were
        getting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly by with
        panic-stricken faces. The station-master, too, ran by in his
        extraordinary colored cap. Obviously something unusual had happened. The
        crowd who had left the train were running back again.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What?... What?... Where?... Flung himself!... Crushed!...&rdquo;
        was heard among the crowd. Stepan Arkadyevitch, with his sister on his
        arm, turned back. They too looked scared, and stopped at the carriage
        door to avoid the crowd.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ladies got in, while Vronsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch followed the
        crowd to find out details of the disaster.
      </p>

      <p>
        A guard, either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost, had
        not heard the train moving back, and had been crushed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before Vronsky and Oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from
        the butler.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oblonsky and Vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse. Oblonsky was
        evidently upset. He frowned and seemed ready to cry.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, how awful! Ah, Anna, if you had seen it! Ah, how
        awful!&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky did not speak; his handsome face was serious, but perfectly
        composed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, if you had seen it, countess,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;And his wife was there.... It was awful to see
        her!... She flung herself on the body. They say he was the only support
        of an immense family. How awful!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t one do anything for her?&rdquo; said Madame
        Karenina in an agitated whisper.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky glanced at her, and immediately got out of the carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back directly, maman,&rdquo; he remarked, turning
        round in the doorway.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he came back a few minutes later, Stepan Arkadyevitch was already
        in conversation with the countess about the new singer, while the
        countess was impatiently looking towards the door, waiting for her son.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Now let us be off,&rdquo; said Vronsky, coming in. They went out
        together. Vronsky was in front with his mother. Behind walked Madame
        Karenina with her brother. Just as they were going out of the station
        the station-master overtook Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You gave my assistant two hundred roubles. Would you kindly
        explain for whose benefit you intend them?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For the widow,&rdquo; said Vronsky, shrugging his shoulders.
        &ldquo;I should have thought there was no need to ask.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You gave that?&rdquo; cried Oblonsky, behind, and, pressing his
        sister&rsquo;s hand, he added: &ldquo;Very nice, very nice! Isn&rsquo;t
        he a splendid fellow? Good-bye, countess.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he and his sister stood still, looking for her maid.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they went out the Vronsky&rsquo;s carriage had already driven away.
        People coming in were still talking of what happened.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a horrible death!&rdquo; said a gentleman, passing by.
        &ldquo;They say he was cut in two pieces.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;On the contrary, I think it&rsquo;s the
        easiest&mdash;instantaneous,&rdquo; observed another.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How is it they don&rsquo;t take proper precautions?&rdquo; said a
        third.
      </p>

      <p>
        Madame Karenina seated herself in the carriage, and Stepan Arkadyevitch
        saw with surprise that her lips were quivering, and she was with
        difficulty restraining her tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it, Anna?&rdquo; he asked, when they had driven a few
        hundred yards.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an omen of evil,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come, that&rsquo;s the chief thing. You can&rsquo;t
        conceive how I&rsquo;m resting my hopes on you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you known Vronsky long?&rdquo; she asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes. You know we&rsquo;re hoping he will marry Kitty.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Anna softly. &ldquo;Come now, let us talk of
        you,&rdquo; she added, tossing her head, as though she would physically
        shake off something superfluous oppressing her. &ldquo;Let us talk of
        your affairs. I got your letter, and here I am.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, all my hopes are in you,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, tell me all about it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Stepan Arkadyevitch began to tell his story.
      </p>

      <p>
        On reaching home Oblonsky helped his sister out, sighed, pressed her
        hand, and set off to his office.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 19</h3>

      <p>
        When Anna went into the room, Dolly was sitting in the little
        drawing-room with a white-headed fat little boy, already like his
        father, giving him a lesson in French reading. As the boy read, he kept
        twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket.
        His mother had several times taken his hand from it, but the fat little
        hand went back to the button again. His mother pulled the button off and
        put it in her pocket.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Keep your hands still, Grisha,&rdquo; she said, and she took up
        her work, a coverlet she had long been making. She always set to work on
        it at depressed moments, and now she knitted at it nervously, twitching
        her fingers and counting the stitches. Though she had sent word the day
        before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came
        or not, she had made everything ready for her arrival, and was expecting
        her sister-in-law with emotion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly was crushed by her sorrow, utterly swallowed up by it. Still she
        did not forget that Anna, her sister-in-law, was the wife of one of the
        most important personages in Petersburg, and was a Petersburg
        <i>grande dame</i>. And, thanks to this circumstance, she did not carry
        out her threat to her husband&mdash;that is to say, she remembered that
        her sister-in-law was coming. &ldquo;And, after all, Anna is in no wise
        to blame,&rdquo; thought Dolly. &ldquo;I know nothing of her except the
        very best, and I have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her
        towards myself.&rdquo; It was true that as far as she could recall her
        impressions at Petersburg at the Karenins&rsquo;, she did not like their
        household itself; there was something artificial in the whole framework
        of their family life. &ldquo;But why should I not receive her? If only
        she doesn&rsquo;t take it into her head to console me!&rdquo; thought
        Dolly. &ldquo;All consolation and counsel and Christian forgiveness, all
        that I have thought over a thousand times, and it&rsquo;s all no
        use.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        All these days Dolly had been alone with her children. She did not want
        to talk of her sorrow, but with that sorrow in her heart she could not
        talk of outside matters. She knew that in one way or another she would
        tell Anna everything, and she was alternately glad at the thought of
        speaking freely, and angry at the necessity of speaking of her
        humiliation with her, his sister, and of hearing her ready-made phrases
        of good advice and comfort. She had been on the lookout for her,
        glancing at her watch every minute, and, as so often happens, let slip
        just that minute when her visitor arrived, so that she did not hear the
        bell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Catching a sound of skirts and light steps at the door, she looked
        round, and her care-worn face unconsciously expressed not gladness, but
        wonder. She got up and embraced her sister-in-law.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What, here already!&rdquo; she said as she kissed her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dolly, how glad I am to see you!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am glad, too,&rdquo; said Dolly, faintly smiling, and trying by
        the expression of Anna&rsquo;s face to find out whether she knew.
        &ldquo;Most likely she knows,&rdquo; she thought, noticing the sympathy
        in Anna&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Well, come along, I&rsquo;ll take you to
        your room,&rdquo; she went on, trying to defer as long as possible the
        moment of confidences.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is this Grisha? Heavens, how he&rsquo;s grown!&rdquo; said Anna;
        and kissing him, never taking her eyes off Dolly, she stood still and
        flushed a little. &ldquo;No, please, let us stay here.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She took off her kerchief and her hat, and catching it in a lock of her
        black hair, which was a mass of curls, she tossed her head and shook her
        hair down.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are radiant with health and happiness!&rdquo; said Dolly,
        almost with envy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I?... Yes,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;Merciful heavens, Tanya!
        You&rsquo;re the same age as my Seryozha,&rdquo; she added, addressing
        the little girl as she ran in. She took her in her arms and kissed her.
        &ldquo;Delightful child, delightful! Show me them all.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She mentioned them, not only remembering the names, but the years,
        months, characters, illnesses of all the children, and Dolly could not
        but appreciate that.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, we will go to them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
        a pity Vassya&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        After seeing the children, they sat down, alone now, in the
        drawing-room, to coffee. Anna took the tray, and then pushed it away
        from her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dolly,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he has told me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly looked coldly at Anna; she was waiting now for phrases of
        conventional sympathy, but Anna said nothing of the sort.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dolly, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to speak
        for him to you, nor to try to comfort you; that&rsquo;s impossible. But,
        darling, I&rsquo;m simply sorry, sorry from my heart for you!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered. She
        moved nearer to her sister-in-law and took her hand in her vigorous
        little hand. Dolly did not shrink away, but her face did not lose its
        frigid expression. She said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To comfort me&rsquo;s impossible. Everything&rsquo;s lost after
        what has happened, everything&rsquo;s over!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And directly she had said this, her face suddenly softened. Anna lifted
        the wasted, thin hand of Dolly, kissed it and said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But, Dolly, what&rsquo;s to be done, what&rsquo;s to be done? How
        is it best to act in this awful position&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you
        must think of.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All&rsquo;s over, and there&rsquo;s nothing more,&rdquo; said
        Dolly. &ldquo;And the worst of all is, you see, that I can&rsquo;t cast
        him off: there are the children, I am tied. And I can&rsquo;t live with
        him! it&rsquo;s a torture to me to see him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dolly, darling, he has spoken to me, but I want to hear it from
        you: tell me about it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly looked at her inquiringly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sympathy and love unfeigned were visible on Anna&rsquo;s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said all at once. &ldquo;But I will tell
        you it from the beginning. You know how I was married. With the
        education mamma gave us I was more than innocent, I was stupid. I knew
        nothing. I know they say men tell their wives of their former lives, but
        Stiva&rdquo;&mdash;she corrected herself&mdash;&ldquo;Stepan
        Arkadyevitch told me nothing. You&rsquo;ll hardly believe it, but till
        now I imagined that I was the only woman he had known. So I lived eight
        years. You must understand that I was so far from suspecting infidelity,
        I regarded it as impossible, and then&mdash;try to imagine it&mdash;with
        such ideas, to find out suddenly all the horror, all the
        loathsomeness.... You must try and understand me. To be fully convinced
        of one&rsquo;s happiness, and all at once....&rdquo; continued Dolly,
        holding back her sobs, &ldquo;to get a letter ... his letter to his
        mistress, my governess. No, it&rsquo;s too awful!&rdquo; She hastily
        pulled out her handkerchief and hid her face in it. &ldquo;I can
        understand being carried away by feeling,&rdquo; she went on after a
        brief silence, &ldquo;but deliberately, slyly deceiving me ... and with
        whom?... To go on being my husband together with her ... it&rsquo;s
        awful! You can&rsquo;t understand....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, I understand! I understand! Dolly, dearest, I do
        understand,&rdquo; said Anna, pressing her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my
        position?&rdquo; Dolly resumed. &ldquo;Not the slightest! He&rsquo;s
        happy and contented.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Anna interposed quickly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s to be
        pitied, he&rsquo;s weighed down by remorse....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is he capable of remorse?&rdquo; Dolly interrupted, gazing
        intently into her sister-in-law&rsquo;s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes. I know him. I could not look at him without feeling sorry
        for him. We both know him. He&rsquo;s good-hearted, but he&rsquo;s
        proud, and now he&rsquo;s so humiliated. What touched me most....&rdquo;
        (and here Anna guessed what would touch Dolly most) &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
        tortured by two things: that he&rsquo;s ashamed for the children&rsquo;s
        sake, and that, loving you&mdash;yes, yes, loving you beyond everything
        on earth,&rdquo; she hurriedly interrupted Dolly, who would have
        answered&mdash;&ldquo;he has hurt you, pierced you to the heart.
        &lsquo;No, no, she cannot forgive me,&rsquo; he keeps saying.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly looked dreamily away beyond her sister-in-law as she listened to
        her words.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I can see that his position is awful; it&rsquo;s worse for
        the guilty than the innocent,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if he feels that
        all the misery comes from his fault. But how am I to forgive him, how am
        I to be his wife again after her? For me to live with him now would be
        torture, just because I love my past love for him....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And sobs cut short her words. But as though of set design, each time she
        was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s young, you see, she&rsquo;s pretty,&rdquo; she went
        on. &ldquo;Do you know, Anna, my youth and my beauty are gone, taken by
        whom? By him and his children. I have worked for him, and all I had has
        gone in his service, and now of course any fresh, vulgar creature has
        more charm for him. No doubt they talked of me together, or, worse
        still, they were silent. Do you understand?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Again her eyes glowed with hatred.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And after that he will tell me.... What! can I believe him?
        Never! No, everything is over, everything that once made my comfort, the
        reward of my work, and my sufferings.... Would you believe it, I was
        teaching Grisha just now: once this was a joy to me, now it is a
        torture. What have I to strive and toil for? Why are the children here?
        What&rsquo;s so awful is that all at once my heart&rsquo;s turned, and
        instead of love and tenderness, I have nothing but hatred for him; yes,
        hatred. I could kill him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Darling Dolly, I understand, but don&rsquo;t torture yourself.
        You are so distressed, so overwrought, that you look at many things
        mistakenly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly grew calmer, and for two minutes both were silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done? Think for me, Anna, help me. I have
        thought over everything, and I see nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna could think of nothing, but her heart responded instantly to each
        word, to each change of expression of her sister-in-law.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;One thing I would say,&rdquo; began Anna. &ldquo;I am his sister,
        I know his character, that faculty of forgetting everything,
        everything&rdquo; (she waved her hand before her forehead), &ldquo;that
        faculty for being completely carried away, but for completely repenting
        too. He cannot believe it, he cannot comprehend now how he can have
        acted as he did.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; he understands, he understood!&rdquo; Dolly broke in.
        &ldquo;But I ... you are forgetting me ... does it make it easier for
        me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Wait a minute. When he told me, I will own I did not realize all
        the awfulness of your position. I saw nothing but him, and that the
        family was broken up. I felt sorry for him, but after talking to you, I
        see it, as a woman, quite differently. I see your agony, and I
        can&rsquo;t tell you how sorry I am for you! But, Dolly, darling, I
        fully realize your sufferings, only there is one thing I don&rsquo;t
        know; I don&rsquo;t know ... I don&rsquo;t know how much love there is
        still in your heart for him. That you know&mdash;whether there is enough
        for you to be able to forgive him. If there is, forgive him!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dolly was beginning, but Anna cut her short, kissing
        her hand once more.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know more of the world than you do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
        know how men like Stiva look at it. You speak of his talking of you with
        her. That never happened. Such men are unfaithful, but their home and
        wife are sacred to them. Somehow or other these women are still looked
        on with contempt by them, and do not touch on their feeling for their
        family. They draw a sort of line that can&rsquo;t be crossed between
        them and their families. I don&rsquo;t understand it, but it is
        so.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but he has kissed her....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dolly, hush, darling. I saw Stiva when he was in love with you. I
        remember the time when he came to me and cried, talking of you, and all
        the poetry and loftiness of his feeling for you, and I know that the
        longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes. You
        know we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word:
        &lsquo;Dolly&rsquo;s a marvelous woman.&rsquo; You have always been a
        divinity for him, and you are that still, and this has not been an
        infidelity of the heart....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But if it is repeated?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It cannot be, as I understand it....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but could you forgive it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t judge.... Yes, I can,&rdquo;
        said Anna, thinking a moment; and grasping the position in her thought
        and weighing it in her inner balance, she added: &ldquo;Yes, I can, I
        can, I can. Yes, I could forgive it. I could not be the same, no; but I
        could forgive it, and forgive it as though it had never been, never been
        at all....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; Dolly interposed quickly, as though saying
        what she had more than once thought, &ldquo;else it would not be
        forgiveness. If one forgives, it must be completely, completely. Come,
        let us go; I&rsquo;ll take you to your room,&rdquo; she said, getting
        up, and on the way she embraced Anna. &ldquo;My dear, how glad I am you
        came. It has made things better, ever so much better.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 20</h3>

      <p>
        The whole of that day Anna spent at home, that&rsquo;s to say at the
        Oblonskys&rsquo;, and received no one, though some of her acquaintances
        had already heard of her arrival, and came to call the same day. Anna
        spent the whole morning with Dolly and the children. She merely sent a
        brief note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at
        home. &ldquo;Come, God is merciful,&rdquo; she wrote.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oblonsky did dine at home: the conversation was general, and his wife,
        speaking to him, addressed him as &ldquo;Stiva,&rdquo; as she had not
        done before. In the relations of the husband and wife the same
        estrangement still remained, but there was no talk now of separation,
        and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw the possibility of explanation and
        reconciliation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Immediately after dinner Kitty came in. She knew Anna Arkadyevna, but
        only very slightly, and she came now to her sister&rsquo;s with some
        trepidation, at the prospect of meeting this fashionable Petersburg
        lady, whom everyone spoke so highly of. But she made a favorable
        impression on Anna Arkadyevna&mdash;she saw that at once. Anna was
        unmistakably admiring her loveliness and her youth: before Kitty knew
        where she was she found herself not merely under Anna&rsquo;s sway, but
        in love with her, as young girls do fall in love with older and married
        women. Anna was not like a fashionable lady, nor the mother of a boy of
        eight years old. In the elasticity of her movements, the freshness and
        the unflagging eagerness which persisted in her face, and broke out in
        her smile and her glance, she would rather have passed for a girl of
        twenty, had it not been for a serious and at times mournful look in her
        eyes, which struck and attracted Kitty. Kitty felt that Anna was
        perfectly simple and was concealing nothing, but that she had another
        higher world of interests inaccessible to her, complex and poetic.
      </p>

      <p>
        After dinner, when Dolly went away to her own room, Anna rose quickly
        and went up to her brother, who was just lighting a cigar.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Stiva,&rdquo; she said to him, winking gaily, crossing him and
        glancing towards the door, &ldquo;go, and God help you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He threw down the cigar, understanding her, and departed through the
        doorway.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Stepan Arkadyevitch had disappeared, she went back to the sofa
        where she had been sitting, surrounded by the children. Either because
        the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt, or that they
        felt a special charm in her themselves, the two elder ones, and the
        younger following their lead, as children so often do, had clung about
        their new aunt since before dinner, and would not leave her side. And it
        had become a sort of game among them to sit as close as possible to
        their aunt, to touch her, hold her little hand, kiss it, play with her
        ring, or even touch the flounce of her skirt.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, come, as we were sitting before,&rdquo; said Anna
        Arkadyevna, sitting down in her place.
      </p>

      <p>
        And again Grisha poked his little face under her arm, and nestled with
        his head on her gown, beaming with pride and happiness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And when is your next ball?&rdquo; she asked Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Next week, and a splendid ball. One of those balls where one
        always enjoys oneself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, are there balls where one always enjoys oneself?&rdquo; Anna
        said, with tender irony.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange, but there are. At the Bobrishtchevs&rsquo;
        one always enjoys oneself, and at the Nikitins&rsquo; too, while at the
        Mezhkovs&rsquo; it&rsquo;s always dull. Haven&rsquo;t you noticed
        it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, my dear, for me there are no balls now where one enjoys
        oneself,&rdquo; said Anna, and Kitty detected in her eyes that
        mysterious world which was not open to her. &ldquo;For me there are some
        less dull and tiresome.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;How can <i>you</i> be dull at a ball?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why should not <i>I</i> be dull at a ball?&rdquo; inquired Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty perceived that Anna knew what answer would follow.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Because you always look nicer than anyone.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna had the faculty of blushing. She blushed a little, and said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In the first place it&rsquo;s never so; and secondly, if it were,
        what difference would it make to me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you coming to this ball?&rdquo; asked Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I imagine it won&rsquo;t be possible to avoid going. Here, take
        it,&rdquo; she said to Tanya, who was pulling the loosely-fitting ring
        off her white, slender-tipped finger.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall be so glad if you go. I should so like to see you at a
        ball.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anyway, if I do go, I shall comfort myself with the thought that
        it&rsquo;s a pleasure to you ... Grisha, don&rsquo;t pull my hair.
        It&rsquo;s untidy enough without that,&rdquo; she said, putting up a
        straying lock, which Grisha had been playing with.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I imagine you at the ball in lilac.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And why in lilac precisely?&rdquo; asked Anna, smiling.
        &ldquo;Now, children, run along, run along. Do you hear? Miss Hoole is
        calling you to tea,&rdquo; she said, tearing the children from her, and
        sending them off to the dining-room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know why you press me to come to the ball. You expect a great
        deal of this ball, and you want everyone to be there to take part in
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you know? Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! what a happy time you are at,&rdquo; pursued Anna. &ldquo;I
        remember, and I know that blue haze like the mist on the mountains in
        Switzerland. That mist which covers everything in that blissful time
        when childhood is just ending, and out of that vast circle, happy and
        gay, there is a path growing narrower and narrower, and it is delightful
        and alarming to enter the ballroom, bright and splendid as it is.... Who
        has not been through it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty smiled without speaking. &ldquo;But how did she go through it? How
        I should like to know all her love story!&rdquo; thought Kitty,
        recalling the unromantic appearance of Alexey Alexandrovitch, her
        husband.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know something. Stiva told me, and I congratulate you. I liked
        him so much,&rdquo; Anna continued. &ldquo;I met Vronsky at the railway
        station.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, was he there?&rdquo; asked Kitty, blushing. &ldquo;What was
        it Stiva told you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Stiva gossiped about it all. And I should be so glad ... I
        traveled yesterday with Vronsky&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; she went on;
        &ldquo;and his mother talked without a pause of him, he&rsquo;s her
        favorite. I know mothers are partial, but....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What did his mother tell you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, a great deal! And I know that he&rsquo;s her favorite; still
        one can see how chivalrous he is.... Well, for instance, she told me
        that he had wanted to give up all his property to his brother, that he
        had done something extraordinary when he was quite a child, saved a
        woman out of the water. He&rsquo;s a hero, in fact,&rdquo; said Anna,
        smiling and recollecting the two hundred roubles he had given at the
        station.
      </p>

      <p>
        But she did not tell Kitty about the two hundred roubles. For some
        reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it. She felt that there
        was something that had to do with her in it, and something that ought
        not to have been.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She pressed me very much to go and see her,&rdquo; Anna went on;
        &ldquo;and I shall be glad to go to see her tomorrow. Stiva is staying a
        long while in Dolly&rsquo;s room, thank God,&rdquo; Anna added, changing
        the subject, and getting up, Kitty fancied, displeased with something.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m first! No, I!&rdquo; screamed the children, who had
        finished tea, running up to their Aunt Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All together,&rdquo; said Anna, and she ran laughing to meet
        them, and embraced and swung round all the throng of swarming children,
        shrieking with delight.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 21</h3>

      <p>
        Dolly came out of her room to the tea of the grown-up people. Stepan
        Arkadyevitch did not come out. He must have left his wife&rsquo;s room
        by the other door.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am afraid you&rsquo;ll be cold upstairs,&rdquo; observed Dolly,
        addressing Anna; &ldquo;I want to move you downstairs, and we shall be
        nearer.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, please, don&rsquo;t trouble about me,&rdquo; answered Anna,
        looking intently into Dolly&rsquo;s face, trying to make out whether
        there had been a reconciliation or not.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It will be lighter for you here,&rdquo; answered her
        sister-in-law.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I assure you that I sleep everywhere, and always like a
        marmot.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the question?&rdquo; inquired Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        coming out of his room and addressing his wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        From his tone both Kitty and Anna knew that a reconciliation had taken
        place.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I want to move Anna downstairs, but we must hang up blinds. No
        one knows how to do it; I must see to it myself,&rdquo; answered Dolly
        addressing him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;God knows whether they are fully reconciled,&rdquo; thought Anna,
        hearing her tone, cold and composed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, nonsense, Dolly, always making difficulties,&rdquo; answered
        her husband. &ldquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll do it all, if you like....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, they must be reconciled,&rdquo; thought Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know how you do everything,&rdquo; answered Dolly. &ldquo;You
        tell Matvey to do what can&rsquo;t be done, and go away yourself,
        leaving him to make a muddle of everything,&rdquo; and her habitual,
        mocking smile curved the corners of Dolly&rsquo;s lips as she spoke.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Full, full reconciliation, full,&rdquo; thought Anna;
        &ldquo;thank God!&rdquo; and rejoicing that she was the cause of it, she
        went up to Dolly and kissed her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not at all. Why do you always look down on me and Matvey?&rdquo;
        said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling hardly perceptibly, and addressing his
        wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        The whole evening Dolly was, as always, a little mocking in her tone to
        her husband, while Stepan Arkadyevitch was happy and cheerful, but not
        so as to seem as though, having been forgiven, he had forgotten his
        offense.
      </p>

      <p>
        At half-past nine o&rsquo;clock a particularly joyful and pleasant
        family conversation over the tea-table at the Oblonskys&rsquo; was
        broken up by an apparently simple incident. But this simple incident for
        some reason struck everyone as strange. Talking about common
        acquaintances in Petersburg, Anna got up quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She is in my album,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and, by the way,
        I&rsquo;ll show you my Seryozha,&rdquo; she added, with a mother&rsquo;s
        smile of pride.
      </p>

      <p>
        Towards ten o&rsquo;clock, when she usually said good-night to her son,
        and often before going to a ball put him to bed herself, she felt
        depressed at being so far from him; and whatever she was talking about,
        she kept coming back in thought to her curly-headed Seryozha. She longed
        to look at his photograph and talk of him. Seizing the first pretext,
        she got up, and with her light, resolute step went for her album. The
        stairs up to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main
        staircase.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as she was leaving the drawing-room, a ring was heard in the hall.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who can that be?&rdquo; said Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s early for me to be fetched, and for anyone else
        it&rsquo;s late,&rdquo; observed Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Sure to be someone with papers for me,&rdquo; put in Stepan
        Arkadyevitch. When Anna was passing the top of the staircase, a servant
        was running up to announce the visitor, while the visitor himself was
        standing under a lamp. Anna glancing down at once recognized Vronsky,
        and a strange feeling of pleasure and at the same time of dread of
        something stirred in her heart. He was standing still, not taking off
        his coat, pulling something out of his pocket. At the instant when she
        was just facing the stairs, he raised his eyes, caught sight of her, and
        into the expression of his face there passed a shade of embarrassment
        and dismay. With a slight inclination of her head she passed, hearing
        behind her Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s loud voice calling him to come
        up, and the quiet, soft, and composed voice of Vronsky refusing.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Anna returned with the album, he was already gone, and Stepan
        Arkadyevitch was telling them that he had called to inquire about the
        dinner they were giving next day to a celebrity who had just arrived.
        &ldquo;And nothing would induce him to come up. What a queer fellow he
        is!&rdquo; added Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty blushed. She thought that she was the only person who knew why he
        had come, and why he would not come up. &ldquo;He has been at
        home,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;and didn&rsquo;t find me, and thought I
        should be here, but he did not come up because he thought it late, and
        Anna&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        All of them looked at each other, saying nothing, and began to look at
        Anna&rsquo;s album.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was nothing either exceptional or strange in a man&rsquo;s calling
        at half-past nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner
        party and not coming in, but it seemed strange to all of them. Above
        all, it seemed strange and not right to Anna.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 22</h3>

      <p>
        The ball was only just beginning as Kitty and her mother walked up the
        great staircase, flooded with light, and lined with flowers and footmen
        in powder and red coats. From the rooms came a constant, steady hum, as
        from a hive, and the rustle of movement; and while on the landing
        between trees they gave last touches to their hair and dresses before
        the mirror, they heard from the ballroom the careful, distinct notes of
        the fiddles of the orchestra beginning the first waltz. A little old man
        in civilian dress, arranging his gray curls before another mirror, and
        diffusing an odor of scent, stumbled against them on the stairs, and
        stood aside, evidently admiring Kitty, whom he did not know. A beardless
        youth, one of those society youths whom the old Prince Shtcherbatsky
        called &ldquo;young bucks,&rdquo; in an exceedingly open waistcoat,
        straightening his white tie as he went, bowed to them, and after running
        by, came back to ask Kitty for a quadrille. As the first quadrille had
        already been given to Vronsky, she had to promise this youth the second.
        An officer, buttoning his glove, stood aside in the doorway, and
        stroking his mustache, admired rosy Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although her dress, her coiffure, and all the preparations for the ball
        had cost Kitty great trouble and consideration, at this moment she
        walked into the ballroom in her elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip
        as easily and simply as though all the rosettes and lace, all the minute
        details of her attire, had not cost her or her family a moment&rsquo;s
        attention, as though she had been born in that tulle and lace, with her
        hair done up high on her head, and a rose and two leaves on the top of
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        When, just before entering the ballroom, the princess, her mother, tried
        to turn right side out of the ribbon of her sash, Kitty had drawn back a
        little. She felt that everything must be right of itself, and graceful,
        and nothing could need setting straight.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was one of Kitty&rsquo;s best days. Her dress was not uncomfortable
        anywhere; her lace berthe did not droop anywhere; her rosettes were not
        crushed nor torn off; her pink slippers with high, hollowed-out heels
        did not pinch, but gladdened her feet; and the thick rolls of fair
        chignon kept up on her head as if they were her own hair. All the three
        buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her
        hand without concealing its lines. The black velvet of her locket
        nestled with special softness round her neck. That velvet was delicious;
        at home, looking at her neck in the looking-glass, Kitty had felt that
        that velvet was speaking. About all the rest there might be a doubt, but
        the velvet was delicious. Kitty smiled here too, at the ball, when she
        glanced at it in the glass. Her bare shoulders and arms gave Kitty a
        sense of chill marble, a feeling she particularly liked. Her eyes
        sparkled, and her rosy lips could not keep from smiling from the
        consciousness of her own attractiveness. She had scarcely entered the
        ballroom and reached the throng of ladies, all tulle, ribbons, lace, and
        flowers, waiting to be asked to dance&mdash;Kitty was never one of that
        throng&mdash;when she was asked for a waltz, and asked by the best
        partner, the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom, a renowned
        director of dances, a married man, handsome and well-built, Yegorushka
        Korsunsky. He had only just left the Countess Bonina, with whom he had
        danced the first half of the waltz, and, scanning his kingdom&mdash;that
        is to say, a few couples who had started dancing&mdash;he caught sight
        of Kitty, entering, and flew up to her with that peculiar, easy amble
        which is confined to directors of balls. Without even asking her if she
        cared to dance, he put out his arm to encircle her slender waist. She
        looked round for someone to give her fan to, and their hostess, smiling
        to her, took it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How nice you&rsquo;ve come in good time,&rdquo; he said to her,
        embracing her waist; &ldquo;such a bad habit to be late.&rdquo; Bending
        her left hand, she laid it on his shoulder, and her little feet in their
        pink slippers began swiftly, lightly, and rhythmically moving over the
        slippery floor in time to the music.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rest to waltz with you,&rdquo; he said to her, as
        they fell into the first slow steps of the waltz. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
        exquisite&mdash;such lightness, precision.&rdquo; He said to her the
        same thing he said to almost all his partners whom he knew well.
      </p>

      <p>
        She smiled at his praise, and continued to look about the room over his
        shoulder. She was not like a girl at her first ball, for whom all faces
        in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland. And she was not a
        girl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the
        ballroom was familiar and tiresome. But she was in the middle stage
        between these two; she was excited, and at the same time she had
        sufficient self-possession to be able to observe. In the left corner of
        the ballroom she saw the cream of society gathered together.
        There&mdash;incredibly naked&mdash;was the beauty Lidi,
        Korsunsky&rsquo;s wife; there was the lady of the house; there shone the
        bald head of Krivin, always to be found where the best people were. In
        that direction gazed the young men, not venturing to approach. There,
        too, she descried Stiva, and there she saw the exquisite figure and head
        of Anna in a black velvet gown. And <i>he</i> was there. Kitty had not
        seen him since the evening she refused Levin. With her long-sighted
        eyes, she knew him at once, and was even aware that he was looking at
        her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Another turn, eh? You&rsquo;re not tired?&rdquo; said Korsunsky,
        a little out of breath.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, thank you!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where shall I take you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Madame Karenina&rsquo;s here, I think ... take me to her.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Wherever you command.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight towards the
        group in the left corner, continually saying, &ldquo;Pardon, mesdames,
        pardon, pardon, mesdames&rdquo;; and steering his course through the sea
        of lace, tulle, and ribbon, and not disarranging a feather, he turned
        his partner sharply round, so that her slim ankles, in light transparent
        stockings, were exposed to view, and her train floated out in fan shape
        and covered Krivin&rsquo;s knees. Korsunsky bowed, set straight his open
        shirt front, and gave her his arm to conduct her to Anna Arkadyevna.
        Kitty, flushed, took her train from Krivin&rsquo;s knees, and, a little
        giddy, looked round, seeking Anna. Anna was not in lilac, as Kitty had
        so urgently wished, but in a black, low-cut, velvet gown, showing her
        full throat and shoulders, that looked as though carved in old ivory,
        and her rounded arms, with tiny, slender wrists. The whole gown was
        trimmed with Venetian guipure. On her head, among her black
        hair&mdash;her own, with no false additions&mdash;was a little wreath of
        pansies, and a bouquet of the same in the black ribbon of her sash among
        white lace. Her coiffure was not striking. All that was noticeable was
        the little wilful tendrils of her curly hair that would always break
        free about her neck and temples. Round her well-cut, strong neck was a
        thread of pearls.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty had been seeing Anna every day; she adored her, and had pictured
        her invariably in lilac. But now seeing her in black, she felt that she
        had not fully seen her charm. She saw her now as someone quite new and
        surprising to her. Now she understood that Anna could not have been in
        lilac, and that her charm was just that she always stood out against her
        attire, that her dress could never be noticeable on her. And her black
        dress, with its sumptuous lace, was not noticeable on her; it was only
        the frame, and all that was seen was she&mdash;simple, natural, elegant,
        and at the same time gay and eager.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was standing holding herself, as always, very erect, and when Kitty
        drew near the group she was speaking to the master of the house, her
        head slightly turned towards him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t throw stones,&rdquo; she was saying, in answer
        to something, &ldquo;though I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; she went
        on, shrugging her shoulders, and she turned at once with a soft smile of
        protection towards Kitty. With a flying, feminine glance she scanned her
        attire, and made a movement of her head, hardly perceptible, but
        understood by Kitty, signifying approval of her dress and her looks.
        &ldquo;You came into the room dancing,&rdquo; she added.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This is one of my most faithful supporters,&rdquo; said
        Korsunsky, bowing to Anna Arkadyevna, whom he had not yet seen.
        &ldquo;The princess helps to make balls happy and successful. Anna
        Arkadyevna, a waltz?&rdquo; he said, bending down to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, have you met?&rdquo; inquired their host.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is there anyone we have not met? My wife and I are like white
        wolves&mdash;everyone knows us,&rdquo; answered Korsunsky. &ldquo;A
        waltz, Anna Arkadyevna?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dance when it&rsquo;s possible not to dance,&rdquo;
        she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But tonight it&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; answered Korsunsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that instant Vronsky came up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, since it&rsquo;s impossible tonight, let us start,&rdquo;
        she said, not noticing Vronsky&rsquo;s bow, and she hastily put her hand
        on Korsunsky&rsquo;s shoulder.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is she vexed with him about?&rdquo; thought Kitty,
        discerning that Anna had intentionally not responded to Vronsky&rsquo;s
        bow. Vronsky went up to Kitty reminding her of the first quadrille, and
        expressing his regret that he had not seen her all this time. Kitty
        gazed in admiration at Anna waltzing, and listened to him. She expected
        him to ask her for a waltz, but he did not, and she glanced wonderingly
        at him. He flushed slightly, and hurriedly asked her to waltz, but he
        had only just put his arm round her waist and taken the first step when
        the music suddenly stopped. Kitty looked into his face, which was so
        close to her own, and long afterwards&mdash;for several years
        after&mdash;that look, full of love, to which he made no response, cut
        her to the heart with an agony of shame.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Pardon! pardon!</i> Waltz! waltz!&rdquo; shouted Korsunsky
        from the other side of the room, and seizing the first young lady he
        came across he began dancing himself.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 23</h3>

      <p>
        Vronsky and Kitty waltzed several times round the room. After the first
        waltz Kitty went to her mother, and she had hardly time to say a few
        words to Countess Nordston when Vronsky came up again for the first
        quadrille. During the quadrille nothing of any significance was said:
        there was disjointed talk between them of the Korsunskys, husband and
        wife, whom he described very amusingly, as delightful children at forty,
        and of the future town theater; and only once the conversation touched
        her to the quick, when he asked her about Levin, whether he was here,
        and added that he liked him so much. But Kitty did not expect much from
        the quadrille. She looked forward with a thrill at her heart to the
        mazurka. She fancied that in the mazurka everything must be decided. The
        fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the mazurka did
        not trouble her. She felt sure she would dance the mazurka with him as
        she had done at former balls, and refused five young men, saying she was
        engaged for the mazurka. The whole ball up to the last quadrille was for
        Kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors, sounds, and motions. She
        only sat down when she felt too tired and begged for a rest. But as she
        was dancing the last quadrille with one of the tiresome young men whom
        she could not refuse, she chanced to be <i>vis-à-vis</i> with Vronsky
        and Anna. She had not been near Anna again since the beginning of the
        evening, and now again she saw her suddenly quite new and surprising.
        She saw in her the signs of that excitement of success she knew so well
        in herself; she saw that she was intoxicated with the delighted
        admiration she was exciting. She knew that feeling and knew its signs,
        and saw them in Anna; saw the quivering, flashing light in her eyes, and
        the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously playing on her lips,
        and the deliberate grace, precision, and lightness of her movements.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;All or one?&rdquo; And not
        assisting the harassed young man she was dancing with in the
        conversation, the thread of which he had lost and could not pick up
        again, she obeyed with external liveliness the peremptory shouts of
        Korsunsky starting them all into the <i>grand rond</i>, and then into
        the <i>chaîne</i>, and at the same time she kept watch with a growing
        pang at her heart. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not the admiration of the crowd
        has intoxicated her, but the adoration of one. And that one? can it be
        he?&rdquo; Every time he spoke to Anna the joyous light flashed into her
        eyes, and the smile of happiness curved her red lips. She seemed to make
        an effort to control herself, to try not to show these signs of delight,
        but they came out on her face of themselves. &ldquo;But what of
        him?&rdquo; Kitty looked at him and was filled with terror. What was
        pictured so clearly to Kitty in the mirror of Anna&rsquo;s face she saw
        in him. What had become of his always self-possessed resolute manner,
        and the carelessly serene expression of his face? Now every time he
        turned to her, he bent his head, as though he would have fallen at her
        feet, and in his eyes there was nothing but humble submission and dread.
        &ldquo;I would not offend you,&rdquo; his eyes seemed every time to be
        saying, &ldquo;but I want to save myself, and I don&rsquo;t know
        how.&rdquo; On his face was a look such as Kitty had never seen before.
      </p>

      <p>
        They were speaking of common acquaintances, keeping up the most trivial
        conversation, but to Kitty it seemed that every word they said was
        determining their fate and hers. And strange it was that they were
        actually talking of how absurd Ivan Ivanovitch was with his French, and
        how the Eletsky girl might have made a better match, yet these words had
        all the while consequence for them, and they were feeling just as Kitty
        did. The whole ball, the whole world, everything seemed lost in fog in
        Kitty&rsquo;s soul. Nothing but the stern discipline of her bringing-up
        supported her and forced her to do what was expected of her, that is, to
        dance, to answer questions, to talk, even to smile. But before the
        mazurka, when they were beginning to rearrange the chairs and a few
        couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big room, a moment of
        despair and horror came for Kitty. She had refused five partners, and
        now she was not dancing the mazurka. She had not even a hope of being
        asked for it, because she was so successful in society that the idea
        would never occur to anyone that she had remained disengaged till now.
        She would have to tell her mother she felt ill and go home, but she had
        not the strength to do this. She felt crushed. She went to the furthest
        end of the little drawing-room and sank into a low chair. Her light,
        transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her slender waist; one bare,
        thin, soft, girlish arm, hanging listlessly, was lost in the folds of
        her pink tunic; in the other she held her fan, and with rapid, short
        strokes fanned her burning face. But while she looked like a butterfly,
        clinging to a blade of grass, and just about to open its rainbow wings
        for fresh flight, her heart ached with a horrible despair.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But perhaps I am wrong, perhaps it was not so?&rdquo; And again
        she recalled all she had seen.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kitty, what is it?&rdquo; said Countess Nordston, stepping
        noiselessly over the carpet towards her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty&rsquo;s lower lip began to quiver; she got up quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kitty, you&rsquo;re not dancing the mazurka?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Kitty in a voice shaking with tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He asked her for the mazurka before me,&rdquo; said Countess
        Nordston, knowing Kitty would understand who were &ldquo;he&rdquo; and
        &ldquo;her.&rdquo; &ldquo;She said: &lsquo;Why, aren&rsquo;t you going
        to dance it with Princess Shtcherbatskaya?&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; answered Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        No one but she herself understood her position; no one knew that she had
        just refused the man whom perhaps she loved, and refused him because she
        had put her faith in another.
      </p>

      <p>
        Countess Nordston found Korsunsky, with whom she was to dance the
        mazurka, and told him to ask Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty danced in the first couple, and luckily for her she had not to
        talk, because Korsunsky was all the time running about directing the
        figure. Vronsky and Anna sat almost opposite her. She saw them with her
        long-sighted eyes, and saw them, too, close by, when they met in the
        figures, and the more she saw of them the more convinced was she that
        her unhappiness was complete. She saw that they felt themselves alone in
        that crowded room. And on Vronsky&rsquo;s face, always so firm and
        independent, she saw that look that had struck her, of bewilderment and
        humble submissiveness, like the expression of an intelligent dog when it
        has done wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna smiled, and her smile was reflected by him. She grew thoughtful,
        and he became serious. Some supernatural force drew Kitty&rsquo;s eyes
        to Anna&rsquo;s face. She was fascinating in her simple black dress,
        fascinating were her round arms with their bracelets, fascinating was
        her firm neck with its thread of pearls, fascinating the straying curls
        of her loose hair, fascinating the graceful, light movements of her
        little feet and hands, fascinating was that lovely face in its
        eagerness, but there was something terrible and cruel in her
        fascination.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty admired her more than ever, and more and more acute was her
        suffering. Kitty felt overwhelmed, and her face showed it. When Vronsky
        saw her, coming across her in the mazurka, he did not at once recognize
        her, she was so changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Delightful ball!&rdquo; he said to her, for the sake of saying
        something.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the middle of the mazurka, repeating a complicated figure, newly
        invented by Korsunsky, Anna came forward into the center of the circle,
        chose two gentlemen, and summoned a lady and Kitty. Kitty gazed at her
        in dismay as she went up. Anna looked at her with drooping eyelids, and
        smiled, pressing her hand. But, noticing that Kitty only responded to
        her smile by a look of despair and amazement, she turned away from her,
        and began gaily talking to the other lady.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, there is something uncanny, devilish and fascinating in
        her,&rdquo; Kitty said to herself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna did not mean to stay to supper, but the master of the house began
        to press her to do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nonsense, Anna Arkadyevna,&rdquo; said Korsunsky, drawing her
        bare arm under the sleeve of his dress coat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve such an
        idea for a
        <i>cotillion! Un bijou!</i>&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he moved gradually on, trying to draw her along with him. Their host
        smiled approvingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I am not going to stay,&rdquo; answered Anna, smiling, but in
        spite of her smile, both Korsunsky and the master of the house saw from
        her resolute tone that she would not stay.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; why, as it is, I have danced more at your ball in Moscow than
        I have all the winter in Petersburg,&rdquo; said Anna, looking round at
        Vronsky, who stood near her. &ldquo;I must rest a little before my
        journey.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you certainly going tomorrow then?&rdquo; asked Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; answered Anna, as it were wondering at
        the boldness of his question; but the irrepressible, quivering
        brilliance of her eyes and her smile set him on fire as she said it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna Arkadyevna did not stay to supper, but went home.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 24</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, there is something in me hateful, repulsive,&rdquo; thought
        Levin, as he came away from the Shtcherbatskys&rsquo;, and walked in the
        direction of his brother&rsquo;s lodgings. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t get
        on with other people. Pride, they say. No, I have no pride. If I had any
        pride, I should not have put myself in such a position.&rdquo; And he
        pictured to himself Vronsky, happy, good-natured, clever, and
        self-possessed, certainly never placed in the awful position in which he
        had been that evening. &ldquo;Yes, she was bound to choose him. So it
        had to be, and I cannot complain of anyone or anything. I am myself to
        blame. What right had I to imagine she would care to join her life to
        mine? Who am I and what am I? A nobody, not wanted by anyone, nor of use
        to anybody.&rdquo; And he recalled his brother Nikolay, and dwelt with
        pleasure on the thought of him. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he right that
        everything in the world is base and loathsome? And are we fair in our
        judgment of brother Nikolay? Of course, from the point of view of
        Prokofy, seeing him in a torn cloak and tipsy, he&rsquo;s a despicable
        person. But I know him differently. I know his soul, and know that we
        are like him. And I, instead of going to seek him out, went out to
        dinner, and came here.&rdquo; Levin walked up to a lamppost, read his
        brother&rsquo;s address, which was in his pocketbook, and called a
        sledge. All the long way to his brother&rsquo;s, Levin vividly recalled
        all the facts familiar to him of his brother Nikolay&rsquo;s life. He
        remembered how his brother, while at the university, and for a year
        afterwards, had, in spite of the jeers of his companions, lived like a
        monk, strictly observing all religious rites, services, and fasts, and
        avoiding every sort of pleasure, especially women. And afterwards, how
        he had all at once broken out: he had associated with the most horrible
        people, and rushed into the most senseless debauchery. He remembered
        later the scandal over a boy, whom he had taken from the country to
        bring up, and, in a fit of rage, had so violently beaten that
        proceedings were brought against him for unlawfully wounding. Then he
        recalled the scandal with a sharper, to whom he had lost money, and
        given a promissory note, and against whom he had himself lodged a
        complaint, asserting that he had cheated him. (This was the money Sergey
        Ivanovitch had paid.) Then he remembered how he had spent a night in the
        lockup for disorderly conduct in the street. He remembered the shameful
        proceedings he had tried to get up against his brother Sergey
        Ivanovitch, accusing him of not having paid him his share of his
        mother&rsquo;s fortune, and the last scandal, when he had gone to a
        western province in an official capacity, and there had got into trouble
        for assaulting a village elder.... It was all horribly disgusting, yet
        to Levin it appeared not at all in the same disgusting light as it
        inevitably would to those who did not know Nikolay, did not know all his
        story, did not know his heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin remembered that when Nikolay had been in the devout stage, the
        period of fasts and monks and church services, when he was seeking in
        religion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament, everyone,
        far from encouraging him, had jeered at him, and he, too, with the
        others. They had teased him, called him Noah, and monk; and, when he had
        broken out, no one had helped him, but everyone had turned away from him
        with horror and disgust.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin felt that, in spite of all the ugliness of his life, his brother
        Nikolay, in his soul, in the very depths of his soul, was no more in the
        wrong than the people who despised him. He was not to blame for having
        been born with his unbridled temperament and his somehow limited
        intelligence. But he had always wanted to be good. &ldquo;I will tell
        him everything, without reserve, and I will make him speak without
        reserve, too, and I&rsquo;ll show him that I love him, and so understand
        him,&rdquo; Levin resolved to himself, as, towards eleven o&rsquo;clock,
        he reached the hotel of which he had the address.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;At the top, 12 and 13,&rdquo; the porter answered Levin&rsquo;s
        inquiry.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;At home?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Sure to be at home.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The door of No. 12 was half open, and there came out into the streak of
        light thick fumes of cheap, poor tobacco, and the sound of a voice,
        unknown to Levin; but he knew at once that his brother was there; he
        heard his cough.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he went in the door, the unknown voice was saying:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the
        thing&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Konstantin Levin looked in at the door, and saw that the speaker was a
        young man with an immense shock of hair, wearing a Russian jerkin, and
        that a pockmarked woman in a woolen gown, without collar or cuffs, was
        sitting on the sofa. His brother was not to be seen. Konstantin felt a
        sharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which
        his brother spent his life. No one had heard him, and Konstantin, taking
        off his galoshes, listened to what the gentleman in the jerkin was
        saying. He was speaking of some enterprise.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, the devil flay them, the privileged classes,&rdquo; his
        brother&rsquo;s voice responded, with a cough. &ldquo;Masha! get us some
        supper and some wine if there&rsquo;s any left; or else go and get
        some.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The woman rose, came out from behind the screen, and saw Konstantin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some gentleman, Nikolay Dmitrievitch,&rdquo; she
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Whom do you want?&rdquo; said the voice of Nikolay Levin,
        angrily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s I,&rdquo; answered Konstantin Levin, coming forward
        into the light.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s <i>I</i>?&rdquo; Nikolay&rsquo;s voice said again,
        still more angrily. He could be heard getting up hurriedly, stumbling
        against something, and Levin saw, facing him in the doorway, the big,
        scared eyes, and the huge, thin, stooping figure of his brother, so
        familiar, and yet astonishing in its weirdness and sickliness.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was even thinner than three years before, when Konstantin Levin had
        seen him last. He was wearing a short coat, and his hands and big bones
        seemed huger than ever. His hair had grown thinner, the same straight
        mustaches hid his lips, the same eyes gazed strangely and naïvely at his
        visitor.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, Kostya!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly, recognizing his
        brother, and his eyes lit up with joy. But the same second he looked
        round at the young man, and gave the nervous jerk of his head and neck
        that Konstantin knew so well, as if his neckband hurt him; and a quite
        different expression, wild, suffering, and cruel, rested on his
        emaciated face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I wrote to you and Sergey Ivanovitch both that I don&rsquo;t know
        you and don&rsquo;t want to know you. What is it you want?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He was not at all the same as Konstantin had been fancying him. The
        worst and most tiresome part of his character, what made all relations
        with him so difficult, had been forgotten by Konstantin Levin when he
        thought of him, and now, when he saw his face, and especially that
        nervous twitching of his head, he remembered it all.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to see you for anything,&rdquo; he answered
        timidly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve simply come to see you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        His brother&rsquo;s timidity obviously softened Nikolay. His lips
        twitched.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, so that&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, come in; sit
        down. Like some supper? Masha, bring supper for three. No, stop a
        minute. Do you know who this is?&rdquo; he said, addressing his brother,
        and indicating the gentleman in the jerkin: &ldquo;This is Mr. Kritsky,
        my friend from Kiev, a very remarkable man. He&rsquo;s persecuted by the
        police, of course, because he&rsquo;s not a scoundrel.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he looked round in the way he always did at everyone in the room.
        Seeing that the woman standing in the doorway was moving to go, he
        shouted to her, &ldquo;Wait a minute, I said.&rdquo; And with the
        inability to express himself, the incoherence that Konstantin knew so
        well, he began, with another look round at everyone, to tell his brother
        Kritsky&rsquo;s story: how he had been expelled from the university for
        starting a benefit society for the poor students and Sunday schools; and
        how he had afterwards been a teacher in a peasant school, and how he had
        been driven out of that too, and had afterwards been condemned for
        something.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re of the Kiev university?&rdquo; said Konstantin Levin
        to Kritsky, to break the awkward silence that followed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I was of Kiev,&rdquo; Kritsky replied angrily, his face
        darkening.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And this woman,&rdquo; Nikolay Levin interrupted him, pointing to
        her, &ldquo;is the partner of my life, Marya Nikolaevna. I took her out
        of a bad house,&rdquo; and he jerked his neck saying this; &ldquo;but I
        love her and respect her, and anyone who wants to know me,&rdquo; he
        added, raising his voice and knitting his brows, &ldquo;I beg to love
        her and respect her. She&rsquo;s just the same as my wife, just the
        same. So now you know whom you&rsquo;ve to do with. And if you think
        you&rsquo;re lowering yourself, well, here&rsquo;s the floor,
        there&rsquo;s the door.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why I should be lowering myself, I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then, Masha, tell them to bring supper; three portions, spirits
        and wine.... No, wait a minute.... No, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.... Go
        along.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 25</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; pursued Nikolay Levin, painfully wrinkling his
        forehead and twitching.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here, do you see?&rdquo;... He pointed to some sort of iron bars,
        fastened together with strings, lying in a corner of the room. &ldquo;Do
        you see that? That&rsquo;s the beginning of a new thing we&rsquo;re
        going into. It&rsquo;s a productive association....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Konstantin scarcely heard him. He looked into his sickly, consumptive
        face, and he was more and more sorry for him, and he could not force
        himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the
        association. He saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him
        from self-contempt. Nikolay Levin went on talking:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You know that capital oppresses the laborer. The laborers with
        us, the peasants, bear all the burden of labor, and are so placed that
        however much they work they can&rsquo;t escape from their position of
        beasts of burden. All the profits of labor, on which they might improve
        their position, and gain leisure for themselves, and after that
        education, all the surplus values are taken from them by the
        capitalists. And society&rsquo;s so constituted that the harder they
        work, the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners, while they
        stay beasts of burden to the end. And that state of things must be
        changed,&rdquo; he finished up, and he looked questioningly at his
        brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; said Konstantin, looking at the patch of
        red that had come out on his brother&rsquo;s projecting cheekbones.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And so we&rsquo;re founding a locksmiths&rsquo; association,
        where all the production and profit and the chief instruments of
        production will be in common.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where is the association to be?&rdquo; asked Konstantin Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In the village of Vozdrem, Kazan government.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But why in a village? In the villages, I think, there is plenty
        of work as it is. Why a locksmiths&rsquo; association in a
        village?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why? Because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever
        were, and that&rsquo;s why you and Sergey Ivanovitch don&rsquo;t like
        people to try and get them out of their slavery,&rdquo; said Nikolay
        Levin, exasperated by the objection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Konstantin Levin sighed, looking meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty
        room. This sigh seemed to exasperate Nikolay still more.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know your and Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s aristocratic views. I
        know that he applies all the power of his intellect to justify existing
        evils.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; and what do you talk of Sergey Ivanovitch for?&rdquo; said
        Levin, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Sergey Ivanovitch? I&rsquo;ll tell you what for!&rdquo; Nikolay
        Levin shrieked suddenly at the name of Sergey Ivanovitch.
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what for.... But what&rsquo;s the use of
        talking? There&rsquo;s only one thing.... What did you come to me for?
        You look down on this, and you&rsquo;re welcome to,&mdash;and go away,
        in God&rsquo;s name go away!&rdquo; he shrieked, getting up from his
        chair. &ldquo;And go away, and go away!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t look down on it at all,&rdquo; said Konstantin
        Levin timidly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even dispute it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At that instant Marya Nikolaevna came back. Nikolay Levin looked round
        angrily at her. She went quickly to him, and whispered something.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not well; I&rsquo;ve grown irritable,&rdquo; said
        Nikolay Levin, getting calmer and breathing painfully; &ldquo;and then
        you talk to me of Sergey Ivanovitch and his article. It&rsquo;s such
        rubbish, such lying, such self-deception. What can a man write of
        justice who knows nothing of it? Have you read his article?&rdquo; he
        asked Kritsky, sitting down again at the table, and moving back off half
        of it the scattered cigarettes, so as to clear a space.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not read it,&rdquo; Kritsky responded gloomily,
        obviously not desiring to enter into the conversation.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Nikolay Levin, now turning with exasperation
        upon Kritsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t see the use of wasting my time over
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, but excuse me, how did you know it would be wasting your
        time? That article&rsquo;s too deep for many people&mdash;that&rsquo;s
        to say it&rsquo;s over their heads. But with me, it&rsquo;s another
        thing; I see through his ideas, and I know where its weakness
        lies.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone was mute. Kritsky got up deliberately and reached his cap.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have supper? All right, good-bye! Come round
        tomorrow with the locksmith.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kritsky had hardly gone out when Nikolay Levin smiled and winked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no good either,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I see, of
        course....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But at that instant Kritsky, at the door, called him....
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you want now?&rdquo; he said, and went out to him in the
        passage. Left alone with Marya Nikolaevna, Levin turned to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you been long with my brother?&rdquo; he said to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, more than a year. Nikolay Dmitrievitch&rsquo;s health has
        become very poor. Nikolay Dmitrievitch drinks a great deal,&rdquo; she
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That is ... how does he drink?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Drinks vodka, and it&rsquo;s bad for him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And a great deal?&rdquo; whispered Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, looking timidly towards the doorway, where
        Nikolay Levin had reappeared.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What were you talking about?&rdquo; he said, knitting his brows,
        and turning his scared eyes from one to the other. &ldquo;What was
        it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; Konstantin answered in confusion.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, if you don&rsquo;t want to say, don&rsquo;t. Only it&rsquo;s
        no good your talking to her. She&rsquo;s a wench, and you&rsquo;re a
        gentleman,&rdquo; he said with a jerk of the neck. &ldquo;You understand
        everything, I see, and have taken stock of everything, and look with
        commiseration on my shortcomings,&rdquo; he began again, raising his
        voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nikolay Dmitrievitch, Nikolay Dmitrievitch,&rdquo; whispered
        Marya Nikolaevna, again going up to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, very well, very well!... But where&rsquo;s the supper? Ah,
        here it is,&rdquo; he said, seeing a waiter with a tray. &ldquo;Here,
        set it here,&rdquo; he added angrily, and promptly seizing the vodka, he
        poured out a glassful and drank it greedily. &ldquo;Like a drink?&rdquo;
        he turned to his brother, and at once became better humored.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, enough of Sergey Ivanovitch. I&rsquo;m glad to see you,
        anyway. After all&rsquo;s said and done, we&rsquo;re not strangers.
        Come, have a drink. Tell me what you&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; he went on,
        greedily munching a piece of bread, and pouring out another glassful.
        &ldquo;How are you living?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I live alone in the country, as I used to. I&rsquo;m busy looking
        after the land,&rdquo; answered Konstantin, watching with horror the
        greediness with which his brother ate and drank, and trying to conceal
        that he noticed it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get married?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t happened so,&rdquo; Konstantin answered,
        reddening a little.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why not? For me now ... everything&rsquo;s at an end! I&rsquo;ve
        made a mess of my life. But this I&rsquo;ve said, and I say still, that
        if my share had been given me when I needed it, my whole life would have
        been different.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Konstantin made haste to change the conversation.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know your little Vanya&rsquo;s with me, a clerk in the
        countinghouse at Pokrovskoe.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Nikolay jerked his neck, and sank into thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, tell me what&rsquo;s going on at Pokrovskoe. Is the house
        standing still, and the birch trees, and our schoolroom? And Philip the
        gardener, is he living? How I remember the arbor and the seat! Now mind
        and don&rsquo;t alter anything in the house, but make haste and get
        married, and make everything as it used to be again. Then I&rsquo;ll
        come and see you, if your wife is nice.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But come to me now,&rdquo; said Levin. &ldquo;How nicely we would
        arrange it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;d come and see you if I were sure I should not find
        Sergey Ivanovitch.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t find him there. I live quite independently of
        him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but say what you like, you will have to choose between me
        and him,&rdquo; he said, looking timidly into his brother&rsquo;s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        This timidity touched Konstantin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject, I tell
        you that in your quarrel with Sergey Ivanovitch I take neither side.
        You&rsquo;re both wrong. You&rsquo;re more wrong externally, and he
        inwardly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, ah! You see that, you see that!&rdquo; Nikolay shouted
        joyfully.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I personally value friendly relations with you more
        because....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, why?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Konstantin could not say that he valued it more because Nikolay was
        unhappy, and needed affection. But Nikolay knew that this was just what
        he meant to say, and scowling he took up the vodka again.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Enough, Nikolay Dmitrievitch!&rdquo; said Marya Nikolaevna,
        stretching out her plump, bare arm towards the decanter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let it be! Don&rsquo;t insist! I&rsquo;ll beat you!&rdquo; he
        shouted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Marya Nikolaevna smiled a sweet and good-humored smile, which was at
        once reflected on Nikolay&rsquo;s face, and she took the bottle.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And do you suppose she understands nothing?&rdquo; said Nikolay.
        &ldquo;She understands it all better than any of us. Isn&rsquo;t it true
        there&rsquo;s something good and sweet in her?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Were you never before in Moscow?&rdquo; Konstantin said to her,
        for the sake of saying something.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Only you mustn&rsquo;t be polite and stiff with her. It frightens
        her. No one ever spoke to her so but the justices of the peace who tried
        her for trying to get out of a house of ill-fame. Mercy on us, the
        senselessness in the world!&rdquo; he cried suddenly. &ldquo;These new
        institutions, these justices of the peace, rural councils, what
        hideousness it all is!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Konstantin Levin heard him, and the disbelief in the sense of all public
        institutions, which he shared with him, and often expressed, was
        distasteful to him now from his brother&rsquo;s lips.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In another world we shall understand it all,&rdquo; he said
        lightly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In another world! Ah, I don&rsquo;t like that other world! I
        don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; he said, letting his scared eyes rest on his
        brother&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Here one would think that to get out of all
        the baseness and the mess, one&rsquo;s own and other people&rsquo;s,
        would be a good thing, and yet I&rsquo;m afraid of death, awfully afraid
        of death.&rdquo; He shuddered. &ldquo;But do drink something. Would you
        like some champagne? Or shall we go somewhere? Let&rsquo;s go to the
        Gypsies! Do you know I have got so fond of the Gypsies and Russian
        songs.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        His speech had begun to falter, and he passed abruptly from one subject
        to another. Konstantin with the help of Masha persuaded him not to go
        out anywhere, and got him to bed hopelessly drunk.
      </p>

      <p>
        Masha promised to write to Konstantin in case of need, and to persuade
        Nikolay Levin to go and stay with his brother.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 26</h3>

      <p>
        In the morning Konstantin Levin left Moscow, and towards evening he
        reached home. On the journey in the train he talked to his neighbors
        about politics and the new railways, and, just as in Moscow, he was
        overcome by a sense of confusion of ideas, dissatisfaction with himself,
        shame of something or other. But when he got out at his own station,
        when he saw his one-eyed coachman, Ignat, with the collar of his coat
        turned up; when, in the dim light reflected by the station fires, he saw
        his own sledge, his own horses with their tails tied up, in their
        harness trimmed with rings and tassels; when the coachman Ignat, as he
        put in his luggage, told him the village news, that the contractor had
        arrived, and that Pava had calved,&mdash;he felt that little by little
        the confusion was clearing up, and the shame and self-dissatisfaction
        were passing away. He felt this at the mere sight of Ignat and the
        horses; but when he had put on the sheepskin brought for him, had sat
        down wrapped up in the sledge, and had driven off pondering on the work
        that lay before him in the village, and staring at the side-horse, that
        had been his saddle-horse, past his prime now, but a spirited beast from
        the Don, he began to see what had happened to him in quite a different
        light. He felt himself, and did not want to be anyone else. All he
        wanted now was to be better than before. In the first place he resolved
        that from that day he would give up hoping for any extraordinary
        happiness, such as marriage must have given him, and consequently he
        would not so disdain what he really had. Secondly, he would never again
        let himself give way to low passion, the memory of which had so tortured
        him when he had been making up his mind to make an offer. Then
        remembering his brother Nikolay, he resolved to himself that he would
        never allow himself to forget him, that he would follow him up, and not
        lose sight of him, so as to be ready to help when things should go ill
        with him. And that would be soon, he felt. Then, too, his
        brother&rsquo;s talk of communism, which he had treated so lightly at
        the time, now made him think. He considered a revolution in economic
        conditions nonsense. But he always felt the injustice of his own
        abundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasants, and now he
        determined that so as to feel quite in the right, though he had worked
        hard and lived by no means luxuriously before, he would now work still
        harder, and would allow himself even less luxury. And all this seemed to
        him so easy a conquest over himself that he spent the whole drive in the
        pleasantest daydreams. With a resolute feeling of hope in a new, better
        life, he reached home before nine o&rsquo;clock at night.
      </p>

      <p>
        The snow of the little quadrangle before the house was lit up by a light
        in the bedroom windows of his old nurse, Agafea Mihalovna, who performed
        the duties of housekeeper in his house. She was not yet asleep. Kouzma,
        waked up by her, came sidling sleepily out onto the steps. A setter
        bitch, Laska, ran out too, almost upsetting Kouzma, and whining, turned
        round about Levin&rsquo;s knees, jumping up and longing, but not daring,
        to put her forepaws on his chest.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re soon back again, sir,&rdquo; said Agafea Mihalovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I got tired of it, Agafea Mihalovna. With friends, one is well;
        but at home, one is better,&rdquo; he answered, and went into his study.
      </p>

      <p>
        The study was slowly lit up as the candle was brought in. The familiar
        details came out: the stag&rsquo;s horns, the bookshelves, the
        looking-glass, the stove with its ventilator, which had long wanted
        mending, his father&rsquo;s sofa, a large table, on the table an open
        book, a broken ashtray, a manuscript book with his handwriting. As he
        saw all this, there came over him for an instant a doubt of the
        possibility of arranging the new life, of which he had been dreaming on
        the road. All these traces of his life seemed to clutch him, and to say
        to him: &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not going to get away from us, and
        you&rsquo;re not going to be different, but you&rsquo;re going to be the
        same as you&rsquo;ve always been; with doubts, everlasting
        dissatisfaction with yourself, vain efforts to amend, and falls, and
        everlasting expectation, of a happiness which you won&rsquo;t get, and
        which isn&rsquo;t possible for you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This the things said to him, but another voice in his heart was telling
        him that he must not fall under the sway of the past, and that one can
        do anything with oneself. And hearing that voice, he went into the
        corner where stood his two heavy dumbbells, and began brandishing them
        like a gymnast, trying to restore his confident temper. There was a
        creak of steps at the door. He hastily put down the dumbbells.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bailiff came in, and said everything, thank God, was doing well; but
        informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been a
        little scorched. This piece of news irritated Levin. The new drying
        machine had been constructed and partly invented by Levin. The bailiff
        had always been against the drying machine, and now it was with
        suppressed triumph that he announced that the buckwheat had been
        scorched. Levin was firmly convinced that if the buckwheat had been
        scorched, it was only because the precautions had not been taken, for
        which he had hundreds of times given orders. He was annoyed, and
        reprimanded the bailiff. But there had been an important and joyful
        event: Pava, his best cow, an expensive beast, bought at a show, had
        calved.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kouzma, give me my sheepskin. And you tell them to take a
        lantern. I&rsquo;ll come and look at her,&rdquo; he said to the bailiff.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cowhouse for the more valuable cows was just behind the house.
        Walking across the yard, passing a snowdrift by the lilac tree, he went
        into the cowhouse. There was the warm, steamy smell of dung when the
        frozen door was opened, and the cows, astonished at the unfamiliar light
        of the lantern, stirred on the fresh straw. He caught a glimpse of the
        broad, smooth, black and piebald back of Hollandka. Berkoot, the bull,
        was lying down with his ring in his lip, and seemed about to get up, but
        thought better of it, and only gave two snorts as they passed by him.
        Pava, a perfect beauty, huge as a hippopotamus, with her back turned to
        them, prevented their seeing the calf, as she sniffed her all over.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin went into the pen, looked Pava over, and lifted the red and
        spotted calf onto her long, tottering legs. Pava, uneasy, began lowing,
        but when Levin put the calf close to her she was soothed, and, sighing
        heavily, began licking her with her rough tongue. The calf, fumbling,
        poked her nose under her mother&rsquo;s udder, and stiffened her tail
        out straight.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here, bring the light, Fyodor, this way,&rdquo; said Levin,
        examining the calf. &ldquo;Like the mother! though the color takes after
        the father; but that&rsquo;s nothing. Very good. Long and broad in the
        haunch. Vassily Fedorovitch, isn&rsquo;t she splendid?&rdquo; he said to
        the bailiff, quite forgiving him for the buckwheat under the influence
        of his delight in the calf.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How could she fail to be? Oh, Semyon the contractor came the day
        after you left. You must settle with him, Konstantin
        Dmitrievitch,&rdquo; said the bailiff. &ldquo;I did inform you about the
        machine.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This question was enough to take Levin back to all the details of his
        work on the estate, which was on a large scale, and complicated. He went
        straight from the cowhouse to the counting house, and after a little
        conversation with the bailiff and Semyon the contractor, he went back to
        the house and straight upstairs to the drawing-room.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 27</h3>

      <p>
        The house was big and old-fashioned, and Levin, though he lived alone,
        had the whole house heated and used. He knew that this was stupid, he
        knew that it was positively not right, and contrary to his present new
        plans, but this house was a whole world to Levin. It was the world in
        which his father and mother had lived and died. They had lived just the
        life that to Levin seemed the ideal of perfection, and that he had
        dreamed of beginning with his wife, his family.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin scarcely remembered his mother. His conception of her was for him
        a sacred memory, and his future wife was bound to be in his imagination
        a repetition of that exquisite, holy ideal of a woman that his mother
        had been.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage that
        he positively pictured to himself first the family, and only secondarily
        the woman who would give him a family. His ideas of marriage were,
        consequently, quite unlike those of the great majority of his
        acquaintances, for whom getting married was one of the numerous facts of
        social life. For Levin it was the chief affair of life, on which its
        whole happiness turned. And now he had to give up that.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he had gone into the little drawing-room, where he always had tea,
        and had settled himself in his armchair with a book, and Agafea
        Mihalovna had brought him tea, and with her usual, &ldquo;Well,
        I&rsquo;ll stay a while, sir,&rdquo; had taken a chair in the window, he
        felt that, however strange it might be, he had not parted from his
        daydreams, and that he could not live without them. Whether with her, or
        with another, still it would be. He was reading a book, and thinking of
        what he was reading, and stopping to listen to Agafea Mihalovna, who
        gossiped away without flagging, and yet with all that, all sorts of
        pictures of family life and work in the future rose disconnectedly
        before his imagination. He felt that in the depth of his soul something
        had been put in its place, settled down, and laid to rest.
      </p>

      <p>
        He heard Agafea Mihalovna talking of how Prohor had forgotten his duty
        to God, and with the money Levin had given him to buy a horse, had been
        drinking without stopping, and had beaten his wife till he&rsquo;d half
        killed her. He listened, and read his book, and recalled the whole train
        of ideas suggested by his reading. It was Tyndall&rsquo;s
        <i>Treatise on Heat</i>. He recalled his own criticisms of Tyndall of
        his complacent satisfaction in the cleverness of his experiments, and
        for his lack of philosophic insight. And suddenly there floated into his
        mind the joyful thought: &ldquo;In two years&rsquo; time I shall have
        two Dutch cows; Pava herself will perhaps still be alive, a dozen young
        daughters of Berkoot and the three others&mdash;how lovely!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He took up his book again. &ldquo;Very good, electricity and heat are
        the same thing; but is it possible to substitute the one quantity for
        the other in the equation for the solution of any problem? No. Well,
        then what of it? The connection between all the forces of nature is felt
        instinctively.... It&rsquo;s particulary nice if Pava&rsquo;s daughter
        should be a red-spotted cow, and all the herd will take after her, and
        the other three, too! Splendid! To go out with my wife and visitors to
        meet the herd.... My wife says, &lsquo;Kostya and I looked after that
        calf like a child.&rsquo; &lsquo;How can it interest you so much?&rsquo;
        says a visitor. &lsquo;Everything that interests him, interests
        me.&rsquo; But who will she be?&rdquo; And he remembered what had
        happened at Moscow.... &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing to be done....
        It&rsquo;s not my fault. But now everything shall go on in a new way.
        It&rsquo;s nonsense to pretend that life won&rsquo;t let one, that the
        past won&rsquo;t let one. One must struggle to live better, much
        better.&rdquo;... He raised his head, and fell to dreaming. Old Laska,
        who had not yet fully digested her delight at his return, and had run
        out into the yard to bark, came back wagging her tail, and crept up to
        him, bringing in the scent of fresh air, put her head under his hand,
        and whined plaintively, asking to be stroked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There, who&rsquo;d have thought it?&rdquo; said Agafea Mihalovna.
        &ldquo;The dog now ... why, she understands that her master&rsquo;s come
        home, and that he&rsquo;s low-spirited.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why low-spirited?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you suppose I don&rsquo;t see it, sir? It&rsquo;s high time I
        should know the gentry. Why, I&rsquo;ve grown up from a little thing
        with them. It&rsquo;s nothing, sir, so long as there&rsquo;s health and
        a clear conscience.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin looked intently at her, surprised at how well she knew his
        thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall I fetch you another cup?&rdquo; said she, and taking his
        cup she went out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Laska kept poking her head under his hand. He stroked her, and she
        promptly curled up at his feet, laying her head on a hindpaw. And in
        token of all now being well and satisfactory, she opened her mouth a
        little, smacked her lips, and settling her sticky lips more comfortably
        about her old teeth, she sank into blissful repose. Levin watched all
        her movements attentively.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he said to himself;
        &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do! Nothing&rsquo;s amiss....
        All&rsquo;s well.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 28</h3>

      <p>
        After the ball, early next morning, Anna Arkadyevna sent her husband a
        telegram that she was leaving Moscow the same day.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I must go, I must go&rdquo;; she explained to her
        sister-in-law the change in her plans in a tone that suggested that she
        had to remember so many things that there was no enumerating them:
        &ldquo;no, it had really better be today!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch was not dining at home, but he promised to come and
        see his sister off at seven o&rsquo;clock.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty, too, did not come, sending a note that she had a headache. Dolly
        and Anna dined alone with the children and the English governess.
        Whether it was that the children were fickle, or that they had acute
        senses, and felt that Anna was quite different that day from what she
        had been when they had taken such a fancy to her, that she was not now
        interested in them,&mdash;but they had abruptly dropped their play with
        their aunt, and their love for her, and were quite indifferent that she
        was going away. Anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for
        her departure. She wrote notes to her Moscow acquaintances, put down her
        accounts, and packed. Altogether Dolly fancied she was not in a placid
        state of mind, but in that worried mood, which Dolly knew well with
        herself, and which does not come without cause, and for the most part
        covers dissatisfaction with self. After dinner, Anna went up to her room
        to dress, and Dolly followed her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How queer you are today!&rdquo; Dolly said to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I? Do you think so? I&rsquo;m not queer, but I&rsquo;m nasty. I
        am like that sometimes. I keep feeling as if I could cry. It&rsquo;s
        very stupid, but it&rsquo;ll pass off,&rdquo; said Anna quickly, and she
        bent her flushed face over a tiny bag in which she was packing a
        nightcap and some cambric handkerchiefs. Her eyes were particularly
        bright, and were continually swimming with tears. &ldquo;In the same way
        I didn&rsquo;t want to leave Petersburg, and now I don&rsquo;t want to
        go away from here.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You came here and did a good deed,&rdquo; said Dolly, looking
        intently at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna looked at her with eyes wet with tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Dolly. I&rsquo;ve done nothing, and could
        do nothing. I often wonder why people are all in league to spoil me.
        What have I done, and what could I do? In your heart there was found
        love enough to forgive....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If it had not been for you, God knows what would have happened!
        How happy you are, Anna!&rdquo; said Dolly. &ldquo;Everything is clear
        and good in your heart.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Every heart has its own <i>skeletons</i>, as the English
        say.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You have no sort of <i>skeleton</i>, have you? Everything is so
        clear in you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have!&rdquo; said Anna suddenly, and, unexpectedly after her
        tears, a sly, ironical smile curved her lips.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, he&rsquo;s amusing, anyway, your <i>skeleton</i>, and not
        depressing,&rdquo; said Dolly, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s depressing. Do you know why I&rsquo;m going today
        instead of tomorrow? It&rsquo;s a confession that weighs on me; I want
        to make it to you,&rdquo; said Anna, letting herself drop definitely
        into an armchair, and looking straight into Dolly&rsquo;s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        And to her surprise Dolly saw that Anna was blushing up to her ears, up
        to the curly black ringlets on her neck.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Anna went on. &ldquo;Do you know why Kitty
        didn&rsquo;t come to dinner? She&rsquo;s jealous of me. I have spoiled
        ... I&rsquo;ve been the cause of that ball being a torture to her
        instead of a pleasure. But truly, truly, it&rsquo;s not my fault, or
        only my fault a little bit,&rdquo; she said, daintily drawling the words
        &ldquo;a little bit.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, how like Stiva you said that!&rdquo; said Dolly, laughing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna was hurt.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh no, oh no! I&rsquo;m not Stiva,&rdquo; she said, knitting her
        brows. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m telling you, just because I
        could never let myself doubt myself for an instant,&rdquo; said Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        But at the very moment she was uttering the words, she felt that they
        were not true. She was not merely doubting herself, she felt emotion at
        the thought of Vronsky, and was going away sooner than she had meant,
        simply to avoid meeting him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, Stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him, and that
        he....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t imagine how absurdly it all came about. I only
        meant to be matchmaking, and all at once it turned out quite
        differently. Possibly against my own will....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She crimsoned and stopped.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, they feel it directly?&rdquo; said Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I should be in despair if there were anything serious in it
        on his side,&rdquo; Anna interrupted her. &ldquo;And I am certain it
        will all be forgotten, and Kitty will leave off hating me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All the same, Anna, to tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m not very
        anxious for this marriage for Kitty. And it&rsquo;s better it should
        come to nothing, if he, Vronsky, is capable of falling in love with you
        in a single day.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, heavens, that would be too silly!&rdquo; said Anna, and again
        a deep flush of pleasure came out on her face, when she heard the idea,
        that absorbed her, put into words. &ldquo;And so here I am going away,
        having made an enemy of Kitty, whom I liked so much! Ah, how sweet she
        is! But you&rsquo;ll make it right, Dolly? Eh?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly could scarcely suppress a smile. She loved Anna, but she enjoyed
        seeing that she too had her weaknesses.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;An enemy? That can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I did so want you all to care for me, as I do for you, and now I
        care for you more than ever,&rdquo; said Anna, with tears in her eyes.
        &ldquo;Ah, how silly I am today!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She passed her handkerchief over her face and began dressing.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the very moment of starting Stepan Arkadyevitch arrived, late, rosy
        and good-humored, smelling of wine and cigars.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna&rsquo;s emotionalism infected Dolly, and when she embraced her
        sister-in-law for the last time, she whispered: &ldquo;Remember, Anna,
        what you&rsquo;ve done for me&mdash;I shall never forget. And remember
        that I love you, and shall always love you as my dearest friend!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; said Anna, kissing her and hiding
        her tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You understood me, and you understand. Good-bye, my
        darling!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 29</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, it&rsquo;s all over, and thank God!&rdquo; was the first
        thought that came to Anna Arkadyevna, when she had said good-bye for the
        last time to her brother, who had stood blocking up the entrance to the
        carriage till the third bell rang. She sat down on her lounge beside
        Annushka, and looked about her in the twilight of the sleeping-carriage.
        &ldquo;Thank God! tomorrow I shall see Seryozha and Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, and my life will go on in the old way, all nice and as
        usual.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Still in the same anxious frame of mind, as she had been all that day,
        Anna took pleasure in arranging herself for the journey with great care.
        With her little deft hands she opened and shut her little red bag, took
        out a cushion, laid it on her knees, and carefully wrapping up her feet,
        settled herself comfortably. An invalid lady had already lain down to
        sleep. Two other ladies began talking to Anna, and a stout elderly lady
        tucked up her feet, and made observations about the heating of the
        train. Anna answered a few words, but not foreseeing any entertainment
        from the conversation, she asked Annushka to get a lamp, hooked it onto
        the arm of her seat, and took from her bag a paper-knife and an English
        novel. At first her reading made no progress. The fuss and bustle were
        disturbing; then when the train had started, she could not help
        listening to the noises; then the snow beating on the left window and
        sticking to the pane, and the sight of the muffled guard passing by,
        covered with snow on one side, and the conversations about the terrible
        snowstorm raging outside, distracted her attention. Farther on, it was
        continually the same again and again: the same shaking and rattling, the
        same snow on the window, the same rapid transitions from steaming heat
        to cold, and back again to heat, the same passing glimpses of the same
        figures in the twilight, and the same voices, and Anna began to read and
        to understand what she read. Annushka was already dozing, the red bag on
        her lap, clutched by her broad hands, in gloves, of which one was torn.
        Anna Arkadyevna read and understood, but it was distasteful to her to
        read, that is, to follow the reflection of other people&rsquo;s lives.
        She had too great a desire to live herself. If she read that the heroine
        of the novel was nursing a sick man, she longed to move with noiseless
        steps about the room of a sick man; if she read of a member of
        Parliament making a speech, she longed to be delivering the speech; if
        she read of how Lady Mary had ridden after the hounds, and had provoked
        her sister-in-law, and had surprised everyone by her boldness, she too
        wished to be doing the same. But there was no chance of doing anything;
        and twisting the smooth paper-knife in her little hands, she forced
        herself to read.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hero of the novel was already almost reaching his English happiness,
        a baronetcy and an estate, and Anna was feeling a desire to go with him
        to the estate, when she suddenly felt that <i>he</i> ought to feel
        ashamed, and that she was ashamed of the same thing. But what had he to
        be ashamed of? &ldquo;What have I to be ashamed of?&rdquo; she asked
        herself in injured surprise. She laid down the book and sank against the
        back of the chair, tightly gripping the paper-cutter in both hands.
        There was nothing. She went over all her Moscow recollections. All were
        good, pleasant. She remembered the ball, remembered Vronsky and his face
        of slavish adoration, remembered all her conduct with him: there was
        nothing shameful. And for all that, at the same point in her memories,
        the feeling of shame was intensified, as though some inner voice, just
        at the point when she thought of Vronsky, were saying to her,
        &ldquo;Warm, very warm, hot.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; she
        said to herself resolutely, shifting her seat in the lounge. &ldquo;What
        does it mean? Am I afraid to look it straight in the face? Why, what is
        it? Can it be that between me and this officer boy there exist, or can
        exist, any other relations than such as are common with every
        acquaintance?&rdquo; She laughed contemptuously and took up her book
        again; but now she was definitely unable to follow what she read. She
        passed the paper-knife over the window pane, then laid its smooth, cool
        surface to her cheek, and almost laughed aloud at the feeling of delight
        that all at once without cause came over her. She felt as though her
        nerves were strings being strained tighter and tighter on some sort of
        screwing peg. She felt her eyes opening wider and wider, her fingers and
        toes twitching nervously, something within oppressing her breathing,
        while all shapes and sounds seemed in the uncertain half-light to strike
        her with unaccustomed vividness. Moments of doubt were continually
        coming upon her, when she was uncertain whether the train were going
        forwards or backwards, or were standing still altogether; whether it
        were Annushka at her side or a stranger. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that on the
        arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some beast? And what am I myself?
        Myself or some other woman?&rdquo; She was afraid of giving way to this
        delirium. But something drew her towards it, and she could yield to it
        or resist it at will. She got up to rouse herself, and slipped off her
        plaid and the cape of her warm dress. For a moment she regained her
        self-possession, and realized that the thin peasant who had come in
        wearing a long overcoat, with buttons missing from it, was the
        stoveheater, that he was looking at the thermometer, that it was the
        wind and snow bursting in after him at the door; but then everything
        grew blurred again.... That peasant with the long waist seemed to be
        gnawing something on the wall, the old lady began stretching her legs
        the whole length of the carriage, and filling it with a black cloud;
        then there was a fearful shrieking and banging, as though someone were
        being torn to pieces; then there was a blinding dazzle of red fire
        before her eyes and a wall seemed to rise up and hide everything. Anna
        felt as though she were sinking down. But it was not terrible, but
        delightful. The voice of a man muffled up and covered with snow shouted
        something in her ear. She got up and pulled herself together; she
        realized that they had reached a station and that this was the guard.
        She asked Annushka to hand her the cape she had taken off and her shawl,
        put them on and moved towards the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you wish to get out?&rdquo; asked Annushka.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I want a little air. It&rsquo;s very hot in here.&rdquo; And
        she opened the door. The driving snow and the wind rushed to meet her
        and struggled with her over the door. But she enjoyed the struggle.
      </p>

      <p>
        She opened the door and went out. The wind seemed as though lying in
        wait for her; with gleeful whistle it tried to snatch her up and bear
        her off, but she clung to the cold door post, and holding her skirt got
        down onto the platform and under the shelter of the carriages. The wind
        had been powerful on the steps, but on the platform, under the lee of
        the carriages, there was a lull. With enjoyment she drew deep breaths of
        the frozen, snowy air, and standing near the carriage looked about the
        platform and the lighted station.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 30</h3>

      <p>
        The raging tempest rushed whistling between the wheels of the carriages,
        about the scaffolding, and round the corner of the station. The
        carriages, posts, people, everything that was to be seen was covered
        with snow on one side, and was getting more and more thickly covered.
        For a moment there would come a lull in the storm, but then it would
        swoop down again with such onslaughts that it seemed impossible to stand
        against it. Meanwhile men ran to and fro, talking merrily together,
        their steps crackling on the platform as they continually opened and
        closed the big doors. The bent shadow of a man glided by at her feet,
        and she heard sounds of a hammer upon iron. &ldquo;Hand over that
        telegram!&rdquo; came an angry voice out of the stormy darkness on the
        other side. &ldquo;This way! No. 28!&rdquo; several different voices
        shouted again, and muffled figures ran by covered with snow. Two
        gentlemen with lighted cigarettes passed by her. She drew one more deep
        breath of the fresh air, and had just put her hand out of her muff to
        take hold of the door post and get back into the carriage, when another
        man in a military overcoat, quite close beside her, stepped between her
        and the flickering light of the lamp post. She looked round, and the
        same instant recognized Vronsky&rsquo;s face. Putting his hand to the
        peak of his cap, he bowed to her and asked, Was there anything she
        wanted? Could he be of any service to her? She gazed rather a long while
        at him without answering, and, in spite of the shadow in which he was
        standing, she saw, or fancied she saw, both the expression of his face
        and his eyes. It was again that expression of reverential ecstasy which
        had so worked upon her the day before. More than once she had told
        herself during the past few days, and again only a few moments before,
        that Vronsky was for her only one of the hundreds of young men, forever
        exactly the same, that are met everywhere, that she would never allow
        herself to bestow a thought upon him. But now at the first instant of
        meeting him, she was seized by a feeling of joyful pride. She had no
        need to ask why he had come. She knew as certainly as if he had told her
        that he was here to be where she was.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were going. What are you coming
        for?&rdquo; she said, letting fall the hand with which she had grasped
        the door post. And irrepressible delight and eagerness shone in her
        face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What am I coming for?&rdquo; he repeated, looking straight into
        her eyes. &ldquo;You know that I have come to be where you are,&rdquo;
        he said; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment the wind, as it were, surmounting all obstacles, sent the
        snow flying from the carriage roofs, and clanked some sheet of iron it
        had torn off, while the hoarse whistle of the engine roared in front,
        plaintively and gloomily. All the awfulness of the storm seemed to her
        more splendid now. He had said what her soul longed to hear, though she
        feared it with her reason. She made no answer, and in her face he saw
        conflict.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Forgive me, if you dislike what I said,&rdquo; he said humbly.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had spoken courteously, deferentially, yet so firmly, so stubbornly,
        that for a long while she could make no answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wrong, what you say, and I beg you, if you&rsquo;re a
        good man, to forget what you&rsquo;ve said, as I forget it,&rdquo; she
        said at last.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not one word, not one gesture of yours shall I, could I, ever
        forget....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Enough, enough!&rdquo; she cried trying assiduously to give a
        stern expression to her face, into which he was gazing greedily. And
        clutching at the cold door post, she clambered up the steps and got
        rapidly into the corridor of the carriage. But in the little corridor
        she paused, going over in her imagination what had happened. Though she
        could not recall her own words or his, she realized instinctively that
        the momentary conversation had brought them fearfully closer; and she
        was panic-stricken and blissful at it. After standing still a few
        seconds, she went into the carriage and sat down in her place. The
        overstrained condition which had tormented her before did not only come
        back, but was intensified, and reached such a pitch that she was afraid
        every minute that something would snap within her from the excessive
        tension. She did not sleep all night. But in that nervous tension, and
        in the visions that filled her imagination, there was nothing
        disagreeable or gloomy: on the contrary there was something blissful,
        glowing, and exhilarating. Towards morning Anna sank into a doze,
        sitting in her place, and when she waked it was daylight and the train
        was near Petersburg. At once thoughts of home, of husband and of son,
        and the details of that day and the following came upon her.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Petersburg, as soon as the train stopped and she got out, the first
        person that attracted her attention was her husband. &ldquo;Oh, mercy!
        why do his ears look like that?&rdquo; she thought, looking at his
        frigid and imposing figure, and especially the ears that struck her at
        the moment as propping up the brim of his round hat. Catching sight of
        her, he came to meet her, his lips falling into their habitual sarcastic
        smile, and his big, tired eyes looking straight at her. An unpleasant
        sensation gripped at her heart when she met his obstinate and weary
        glance, as though she had expected to see him different. She was
        especially struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself that
        she experienced on meeting him. That feeling was an intimate, familiar
        feeling, like a consciousness of hypocrisy, which she experienced in her
        relations with her husband. But hitherto she had not taken note of the
        feeling, now she was clearly and painfully aware of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, as you see, your tender spouse, as devoted as the first year
        after marriage, burned with impatience to see you,&rdquo; he said in his
        deliberate, high-pitched voice, and in that tone which he almost always
        took with her, a tone of jeering at anyone who should say in earnest
        what he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is Seryozha quite well?&rdquo; she asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And is this all the reward,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for my ardor?
        He&rsquo;s quite well....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 31</h3>

      <p>
        Vronsky had not even tried to sleep all that night. He sat in his
        armchair, looking straight before him or scanning the people who got in
        and out. If he had indeed on previous occasions struck and impressed
        people who did not know him by his air of unhesitating composure, he
        seemed now more haughty and self-possessed than ever. He looked at
        people as if they were things. A nervous young man, a clerk in a law
        court, sitting opposite him, hated him for that look. The young man
        asked him for a light, and entered into conversation with him, and even
        pushed against him, to make him feel that he was not a thing, but a
        person. But Vronsky gazed at him exactly as he did at the lamp, and the
        young man made a wry face, feeling that he was losing his
        self-possession under the oppression of this refusal to recognize him as
        a person.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky saw nothing and no one. He felt himself a king, not because he
        believed that he had made an impression on Anna&mdash;he did not yet
        believe that,&mdash;but because the impression she had made on him gave
        him happiness and pride.
      </p>

      <p>
        What would come of it all he did not know, he did not even think. He
        felt that all his forces, hitherto dissipated, wasted, were centered on
        one thing, and bent with fearful energy on one blissful goal. And he was
        happy at it. He knew only that he had told her the truth, that he had
        come where she was, that all the happiness of his life, the only meaning
        in life for him, now lay in seeing and hearing her. And when he got out
        of the carriage at Bologova to get some seltzer water, and caught sight
        of Anna, involuntarily his first word had told her just what he thought.
        And he was glad he had told her it, that she knew it now and was
        thinking of it. He did not sleep all night. When he was back in the
        carriage, he kept unceasingly going over every position in which he had
        seen her, every word she had uttered, and before his fancy, making his
        heart faint with emotion, floated pictures of a possible future.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he got out of the train at Petersburg, he felt after his sleepless
        night as keen and fresh as after a cold bath. He paused near his
        compartment, waiting for her to get out. &ldquo;Once more,&rdquo; he
        said to himself, smiling unconsciously, &ldquo;once more I shall see her
        walk, her face; she will say something, turn her head, glance, smile,
        maybe.&rdquo; But before he caught sight of her, he saw her husband,
        whom the station-master was deferentially escorting through the crowd.
        &ldquo;Ah, yes! The husband.&rdquo; Only now for the first time did
        Vronsky realize clearly the fact that there was a person attached to
        her, a husband. He knew that she had a husband, but had hardly believed
        in his existence, and only now fully believed in him, with his head and
        shoulders, and his legs clad in black trousers; especially when he saw
        this husband calmly take her arm with a sense of property.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seeing Alexey Alexandrovitch with his Petersburg face and severely
        self-confident figure, in his round hat, with his rather prominent
        spine, he believed in him, and was aware of a disagreeable sensation,
        such as a man might feel tortured by thirst, who, on reaching a spring,
        should find a dog, a sheep, or a pig, who has drunk of it and muddied
        the water. Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s manner of walking, with a swing
        of the hips and flat feet, particularly annoyed Vronsky. He could
        recognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love her. But
        she was still the same, and the sight of her affected him the same way,
        physically reviving him, stirring him, and filling his soul with
        rapture. He told his German valet, who ran up to him from the second
        class, to take his things and go on, and he himself went up to her. He
        saw the first meeting between the husband and wife, and noted with a
        lover&rsquo;s insight the signs of slight reserve with which she spoke
        to her husband. &ldquo;No, she does not love him and cannot love
        him,&rdquo; he decided to himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the moment when he was approaching Anna Arkadyevna he noticed too
        with joy that she was conscious of his being near, and looked round, and
        seeing him, turned again to her husband.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you passed a good night?&rdquo; he asked, bowing to her and
        her husband together, and leaving it up to Alexey Alexandrovitch to
        accept the bow on his own account, and to recognize it or not, as he
        might see fit.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you, very good,&rdquo; she answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her face looked weary, and there was not that play of eagerness in it,
        peeping out in her smile and her eyes; but for a single instant, as she
        glanced at him, there was a flash of something in her eyes, and although
        the flash died away at once, he was happy for that moment. She glanced
        at her husband to find out whether he knew Vronsky. Alexey
        Alexandrovitch looked at Vronsky with displeasure, vaguely recalling who
        this was. Vronsky&rsquo;s composure and self-confidence here struck,
        like a scythe against a stone, upon the cold self-confidence of Alexey
        Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Count Vronsky,&rdquo; said Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! We are acquainted, I believe,&rdquo; said Alexey
        Alexandrovitch indifferently, giving his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You set off with the mother and you return with the son,&rdquo;
        he said, articulating each syllable, as though each were a separate
        favor he was bestowing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re back from leave, I suppose?&rdquo; he said, and
        without waiting for a reply, he turned to his wife in his jesting tone:
        &ldquo;Well, were a great many tears shed at Moscow at parting?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        By addressing his wife like this he gave Vronsky to understand that he
        wished to be left alone, and, turning slightly towards him, he touched
        his hat; but Vronsky turned to Anna Arkadyevna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I hope I may have the honor of calling on you,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced with his weary eyes at Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; he said coldly. &ldquo;On Mondays we&rsquo;re
        at home. Most fortunate,&rdquo; he said to his wife, dismissing Vronsky
        altogether, &ldquo;that I should just have half an hour to meet you, so
        that I can prove my devotion,&rdquo; he went on in the same jesting
        tone.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You lay too much stress on your devotion for me to value it
        much,&rdquo; she responded in the same jesting tone, involuntarily
        listening to the sound of Vronsky&rsquo;s steps behind them. &ldquo;But
        what has it to do with me?&rdquo; she said to herself, and she began
        asking her husband how Seryozha had got on without her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, capitally! Mariette says he has been very good, And ... I
        must disappoint you ... but he has not missed you as your husband has.
        But once more
        <i>merci,</i> my dear, for giving me a day. Our dear <i>Samovar</i> will
        be delighted.&rdquo; (He used to call the Countess Lidia Ivanovna, well
        known in society, a samovar, because she was always bubbling over with
        excitement.) &ldquo;She has been continually asking after you. And, do
        you know, if I may venture to advise you, you should go and see her
        today. You know how she takes everything to heart. Just now, with all
        her own cares, she&rsquo;s anxious about the Oblonskys being brought
        together.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a friend of her husband&rsquo;s, and the
        center of that one of the coteries of the Petersburg world with which
        Anna was, through her husband, in the closest relations.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you know I wrote to her?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Still she&rsquo;ll want to hear details. Go and see her, if
        you&rsquo;re not too tired, my dear. Well, Kondraty will take you in the
        carriage, while I go to my committee. I shall not be alone at dinner
        again,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch went on, no longer in a sarcastic
        tone. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how I&rsquo;ve missed....&rdquo;
        And with a long pressure of her hand and a meaning smile, he put her in
        her carriage.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 32</h3>

      <p>
        The first person to meet Anna at home was her son. He dashed down the
        stairs to her, in spite of the governess&rsquo;s call, and with
        desperate joy shrieked: &ldquo;Mother! mother!&rdquo; Running up to her,
        he hung on her neck.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I told you it was mother!&rdquo; he shouted to the governess.
        &ldquo;I knew!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And her son, like her husband, aroused in Anna a feeling akin to
        disappointment. She had imagined him better than he was in reality. She
        had to let herself drop down to the reality to enjoy him as he really
        was. But even as he was, he was charming, with his fair curls, his blue
        eyes, and his plump, graceful little legs in tightly pulled-up
        stockings. Anna experienced almost physical pleasure in the sensation of
        his nearness, and his caresses, and moral soothing, when she met his
        simple, confiding, and loving glance, and heard his naïve questions.
        Anna took out the presents Dolly&rsquo;s children had sent him, and told
        her son what sort of little girl was Tanya at Moscow, and how Tanya
        could read, and even taught the other children.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, am I not so nice as she?&rdquo; asked Seryozha.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To me you&rsquo;re nicer than anyone in the world.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said Seryozha, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna had not had time to drink her coffee when the Countess Lidia
        Ivanovna was announced. The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a tall, stout
        woman, with an unhealthily sallow face and splendid, pensive black eyes.
        Anna liked her, but today she seemed to be seeing her for the first time
        with all her defects.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, my dear, so you took the olive branch?&rdquo; inquired
        Countess Lidia Ivanovna, as soon as she came into the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all over, but it was all much less serious than
        we had supposed,&rdquo; answered Anna. &ldquo;My <i>belle-sœur</i> is in
        general too hasty.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But Countess Lidia Ivanovna, though she was interested in everything
        that did not concern her, had a habit of never listening to what
        interested her; she interrupted Anna:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s plenty of sorrow and evil in the world. I am
        so worried today.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, why?&rdquo; asked Anna, trying to suppress a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to be weary of fruitlessly championing the
        truth, and sometimes I&rsquo;m quite unhinged by it. The Society of the
        Little Sisters&rdquo; (this was a religiously-patriotic, philanthropic
        institution) &ldquo;was going splendidly, but with these gentlemen
        it&rsquo;s impossible to do anything,&rdquo; added Countess Lidia
        Ivanovna in a tone of ironical submission to destiny. &ldquo;They pounce
        on the idea, and distort it, and then work it out so pettily and
        unworthily. Two or three people, your husband among them, understand all
        the importance of the thing, but the others simply drag it down.
        Yesterday Pravdin wrote to me....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Pravdin was a well-known Panslavist abroad, and Countess Lidia Ivanovna
        described the purport of his letter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then the countess told her of more disagreements and intrigues against
        the work of the unification of the churches, and departed in haste, as
        she had that day to be at the meeting of some society and also at the
        Slavonic committee.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It was all the same before, of course; but why was it I
        didn&rsquo;t notice it before?&rdquo; Anna asked herself. &ldquo;Or has
        she been very much irritated today? It&rsquo;s really ludicrous; her
        object is doing good; she a Christian, yet she&rsquo;s always angry; and
        she always has enemies, and always enemies in the name of Christianity
        and doing good.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        After Countess Lidia Ivanovna another friend came, the wife of a chief
        secretary, who told her all the news of the town. At three o&rsquo;clock
        she too went away, promising to come to dinner. Alexey Alexandrovitch
        was at the ministry. Anna, left alone, spent the time till dinner in
        assisting at her son&rsquo;s dinner (he dined apart from his parents)
        and in putting her things in order, and in reading and answering the
        notes and letters which had accumulated on her table.
      </p>

      <p>
        The feeling of causeless shame, which she had felt on the journey, and
        her excitement, too, had completely vanished. In the habitual conditions
        of her life she felt again resolute and irreproachable.
      </p>

      <p>
        She recalled with wonder her state of mind on the previous day.
        &ldquo;What was it? Nothing. Vronsky said something silly, which it was
        easy to put a stop to, and I answered as I ought to have done. To speak
        of it to my husband would be unnecessary and out of the question. To
        speak of it would be to attach importance to what has no
        importance.&rdquo; She remembered how she had told her husband of what
        was almost a declaration made her at Petersburg by a young man, one of
        her husband&rsquo;s subordinates, and how Alexey Alexandrovitch had
        answered that every woman living in the world was exposed to such
        incidents, but that he had the fullest confidence in her tact, and could
        never lower her and himself by jealousy. &ldquo;So then there&rsquo;s no
        reason to speak of it? And indeed, thank God, there&rsquo;s nothing to
        speak of,&rdquo; she told herself.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 33</h3>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch came back from the meeting of the ministers at
        four o&rsquo;clock, but as often happened, he had not time to come in to
        her. He went into his study to see the people waiting for him with
        petitions, and to sign some papers brought him by his chief secretary.
        At dinner time (there were always a few people dining with the Karenins)
        there arrived an old lady, a cousin of Alexey Alexandrovitch, the chief
        secretary of the department and his wife, and a young man who had been
        recommended to Alexey Alexandrovitch for the service. Anna went into the
        drawing-room to receive these guests. Precisely at five o&rsquo;clock,
        before the bronze Peter the First clock had struck the fifth stroke,
        Alexey Alexandrovitch came in, wearing a white tie and evening coat with
        two stars, as he had to go out directly after dinner. Every minute of
        Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s life was portioned out and occupied. And
        to make time to get through all that lay before him every day, he
        adhered to the strictest punctuality. &ldquo;Unhasting and
        unresting,&rdquo; was his motto. He came into the dining hall, greeted
        everyone, and hurriedly sat down, smiling to his wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, my solitude is over. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how
        uncomfortable&rdquo; (he laid stress on the word <i>uncomfortable</i>)
        &ldquo;it is to dine alone.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At dinner he talked a little to his wife about Moscow matters, and, with
        a sarcastic smile, asked her after Stepan Arkadyevitch; but the
        conversation was for the most part general, dealing with Petersburg
        official and public news. After dinner he spent half an hour with his
        guests, and again, with a smile, pressed his wife&rsquo;s hand,
        withdrew, and drove off to the council. Anna did not go out that evening
        either to the Princess Betsy Tverskaya, who, hearing of her return, had
        invited her, nor to the theater, where she had a box for that evening.
        She did not go out principally because the dress she had reckoned upon
        was not ready. Altogether, Anna, on turning, after the departure of her
        guests, to the consideration of her attire, was very much annoyed. She
        was generally a mistress of the art of dressing well without great
        expense, and before leaving Moscow she had given her dressmaker three
        dresses to transform. The dresses had to be altered so that they could
        not be recognized, and they ought to have been ready three days before.
        It appeared that two dresses had not been done at all, while the other
        one had not been altered as Anna had intended. The dressmaker came to
        explain, declaring that it would be better as she had done it, and Anna
        was so furious that she felt ashamed when she thought of it afterwards.
        To regain her serenity completely she went into the nursery, and spent
        the whole evening with her son, put him to bed herself, signed him with
        the cross, and tucked him up. She was glad she had not gone out
        anywhere, and had spent the evening so well. She felt so light-hearted
        and serene, she saw so clearly that all that had seemed to her so
        important on her railway journey was only one of the common trivial
        incidents of fashionable life, and that she had no reason to feel
        ashamed before anyone else or before herself. Anna sat down at the
        hearth with an English novel and waited for her husband. Exactly at
        half-past nine she heard his ring, and he came into the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here you are at last!&rdquo; she observed, holding out her hand
        to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He kissed her hand and sat down beside her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Altogether then, I see your visit was a success,&rdquo; he said
        to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said, and she began telling him about
        everything from the beginning: her journey with Countess Vronskaya, her
        arrival, the accident at the station. Then she described the pity she
        had felt, first for her brother, and afterwards for Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I imagine one cannot exonerate such a man from blame, though he
        is your brother,&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch severely.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna smiled. She knew that he said that simply to show that family
        considerations could not prevent him from expressing his genuine
        opinion. She knew that characteristic in her husband, and liked it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am glad it has all ended so satisfactorily, and that you are
        back again,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Come, what do they say about the
        new act I have got passed in the council?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna had heard nothing of this act, and she felt conscience-stricken at
        having been able so readily to forget what was to him of such
        importance.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here, on the other hand, it has made a great sensation,&rdquo; he
        said, with a complacent smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        She saw that Alexey Alexandrovitch wanted to tell her something pleasant
        to him about it, and she brought him by questions to telling it. With
        the same complacent smile he told her of the ovations he had received in
        consequence of the act he had passed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I was very, very glad. It shows that at last a reasonable and
        steady view of the matter is becoming prevalent among us.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Having drunk his second cup of tea with cream, and bread, Alexey
        Alexandrovitch got up, and was going towards his study.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve not been anywhere this evening? You&rsquo;ve
        been dull, I expect?&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she answered, getting up after him and
        accompanying him across the room to his study. &ldquo;What are you
        reading now?&rdquo; she asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Just now I&rsquo;m reading Duc de Lille,
        <i>Poésie des Enfers,</i>&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;A very remarkable
        book.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna smiled, as people smile at the weaknesses of those they love, and,
        putting her hand under his, she escorted him to the door of the study.
        She knew his habit, that had grown into a necessity, of reading in the
        evening. She knew, too, that in spite of his official duties, which
        swallowed up almost the whole of his time, he considered it his duty to
        keep up with everything of note that appeared in the intellectual world.
        She knew, too, that he was really interested in books dealing with
        politics, philosophy, and theology, that art was utterly foreign to his
        nature; but, in spite of this, or rather, in consequence of it, Alexey
        Alexandrovitch never passed over anything in the world of art, but made
        it his duty to read everything. She knew that in politics, in
        philosophy, in theology, Alexey Alexandrovitch often had doubts, and
        made investigations; but on questions of art and poetry, and, above all,
        of music, of which he was totally devoid of understanding, he had the
        most distinct and decided opinions. He was fond of talking about
        Shakespeare, Raphael, Beethoven, of the significance of new schools of
        poetry and music, all of which were classified by him with very
        conspicuous consistency.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, God be with you,&rdquo; she said at the door of the study,
        where a shaded candle and a decanter of water were already put by his
        armchair. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll write to Moscow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He pressed her hand, and again kissed it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All the same he&rsquo;s a good man; truthful, good-hearted, and
        remarkable in his own line,&rdquo; Anna said to herself going back to
        her room, as though she were defending him to someone who had attacked
        him and said that one could not love him. &ldquo;But why is it his ears
        stick out so strangely? Or has he had his hair cut?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Precisely at twelve o&rsquo;clock, when Anna was still sitting at her
        writing-table, finishing a letter to Dolly, she heard the sound of
        measured steps in slippers, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, freshly washed
        and combed, with a book under his arm, came in to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time, it&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; said he, with a meaning
        smile, and he went into their bedroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And what right had he to look at him like that?&rdquo; thought
        Anna, recalling Vronsky&rsquo;s glance at Alexey Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Undressing, she went into the bedroom; but her face had none of the
        eagerness which, during her stay in Moscow, had fairly flashed from her
        eyes and her smile; on the contrary, now the fire seemed quenched in
        her, hidden somewhere far away.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 34</h3>

      <p>
        When Vronsky went to Moscow from Petersburg, he had left his large set
        of rooms in Morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade Petritsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        Petritsky was a young lieutenant, not particularly well-connected, and
        not merely not wealthy, but always hopelessly in debt. Towards evening
        he was always drunk, and he had often been locked up after all sorts of
        ludicrous and disgraceful scandals, but he was a favorite both of his
        comrades and his superior officers. On arriving at twelve o&rsquo;clock
        from the station at his flat, Vronsky saw, at the outer door, a hired
        carriage familiar to him. While still outside his own door, as he rang,
        he heard masculine laughter, the lisp of a feminine voice, and
        Petritsky&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s one of the villains,
        don&rsquo;t let him in!&rdquo; Vronsky told the servant not to announce
        him, and slipped quietly into the first room. Baroness Shilton, a friend
        of Petritsky&rsquo;s, with a rosy little face and flaxen hair,
        resplendent in a lilac satin gown, and filling the whole room, like a
        canary, with her Parisian chatter, sat at the round table making coffee.
        Petritsky, in his overcoat, and the cavalry captain Kamerovsky, in full
        uniform, probably just come from duty, were sitting each side of her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Bravo! Vronsky!&rdquo; shouted Petritsky, jumping up, scraping
        his chair. &ldquo;Our host himself! Baroness, some coffee for him out of
        the new coffee pot. Why, we didn&rsquo;t expect you! Hope you&rsquo;re
        satisfied with the ornament of your study,&rdquo; he said, indicating
        the baroness. &ldquo;You know each other, of course?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; said Vronsky, with a bright smile,
        pressing the baroness&rsquo;s little hand. &ldquo;What next! I&rsquo;m
        an old friend.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re home after a journey,&rdquo; said the baroness,
        &ldquo;so I&rsquo;m flying. Oh, I&rsquo;ll be off this minute, if
        I&rsquo;m in the way.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re home, wherever you are, baroness,&rdquo; said
        Vronsky. &ldquo;How do you do, Kamerovsky?&rdquo; he added, coldly
        shaking hands with Kamerovsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There, you never know how to say such pretty things,&rdquo; said
        the baroness, turning to Petritsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; what&rsquo;s that for? After dinner I say things quite as
        good.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;After dinner there&rsquo;s no credit in them? Well, then,
        I&rsquo;ll make you some coffee, so go and wash and get ready,&rdquo;
        said the baroness, sitting down again, and anxiously turning the screw
        in the new coffee pot. &ldquo;Pierre, give me the coffee,&rdquo; she
        said, addressing Petritsky, whom she called Pierre as a contraction of
        his surname, making no secret of her relations with him.
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put it in.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll spoil it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t spoil it! Well, and your wife?&rdquo; said the
        baroness suddenly, interrupting Vronsky&rsquo;s conversation with his
        comrade. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been marrying you here. Have you brought
        your wife?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, baroness. I was born a Bohemian, and a Bohemian I shall
        die.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So much the better, so much the better. Shake hands on it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And the baroness, detaining Vronsky, began telling him, with many jokes,
        about her last new plans of life, asking his advice.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He persists in refusing to give me a divorce! Well, what am I to
        do?&rdquo; (<i>He</i> was her husband.) &ldquo;Now I want to begin a
        suit against him. What do you advise? Kamerovsky, look after the coffee;
        it&rsquo;s boiling over. You see, I&rsquo;m engrossed with business! I
        want a lawsuit, because I must have my property. Do you understand the
        folly of it, that on the pretext of my being unfaithful to him,&rdquo;
        she said contemptuously, &ldquo;he wants to get the benefit of my
        fortune.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky heard with pleasure this light-hearted prattle of a pretty
        woman, agreed with her, gave her half-joking counsel, and altogether
        dropped at once into the tone habitual to him in talking to such women.
        In his Petersburg world all people were divided into utterly opposed
        classes. One, the lower class, vulgar, stupid, and, above all,
        ridiculous people, who believe that one husband ought to live with the
        one wife whom he has lawfully married; that a girl should be innocent, a
        woman modest, and a man manly, self-controlled, and strong; that one
        ought to bring up one&rsquo;s children, earn one&rsquo;s bread, and pay
        one&rsquo;s debts; and various similar absurdities. This was the class
        of old-fashioned and ridiculous people. But there was another class of
        people, the real people. To this class they all belonged, and in it the
        great thing was to be elegant, generous, plucky, gay, to abandon oneself
        without a blush to every passion, and to laugh at everything else.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the first moment only, Vronsky was startled after the impression of
        a quite different world that he had brought with him from Moscow. But
        immediately as though slipping his feet into old slippers, he dropped
        back into the light-hearted, pleasant world he had always lived in.
      </p>

      <p>
        The coffee was never really made, but spluttered over everyone, and
        boiled away, doing just what was required of it&mdash;that is, providing
        much cause for much noise and laughter, and spoiling a costly rug and
        the baroness&rsquo;s gown.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well now, good-bye, or you&rsquo;ll never get washed, and I shall
        have on my conscience the worst sin a gentleman can commit. So you would
        advise a knife to his throat?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To be sure, and manage that your hand may not be far from his
        lips. He&rsquo;ll kiss your hand, and all will end
        satisfactorily,&rdquo; answered Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So at the Français!&rdquo; and, with a rustle of her skirts, she
        vanished.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kamerovsky got up too, and Vronsky, not waiting for him to go, shook
        hands and went off to his dressing-room.
      </p>

      <p>
        While he was washing, Petritsky described to him in brief outlines his
        position, as far as it had changed since Vronsky had left Petersburg. No
        money at all. His father said he wouldn&rsquo;t give him any and pay his
        debts. His tailor was trying to get him locked up, and another fellow,
        too, was threatening to get him locked up. The colonel of the regiment
        had announced that if these scandals did not cease he would have to
        leave. As for the baroness, he was sick to death of her, especially
        since she&rsquo;d taken to offering continually to lend him money. But
        he had found a girl&mdash;he&rsquo;d show her to Vronsky&mdash;a marvel,
        exquisite, in the strict Oriental style, &ldquo;genre of the slave
        Rebecca, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d had a row, too, with
        Berkoshov, and was going to send seconds to him, but of course it would
        come to nothing. Altogether everything was supremely amusing and jolly.
        And, not letting his comrade enter into further details of his position,
        Petritsky proceeded to tell him all the interesting news. As he listened
        to Petritsky&rsquo;s familiar stories in the familiar setting of the
        rooms he had spent the last three years in, Vronsky felt a delightful
        sense of coming back to the careless Petersburg life that he was used
        to.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; he cried, letting down the pedal of the
        washing basin in which he had been sousing his healthy red neck.
        &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; he cried, at the news that Laura had flung
        over Fertinghof and had made up to Mileev. &ldquo;And is he as stupid
        and pleased as ever? Well, and how&rsquo;s Buzulukov?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, there is a tale about Buzulukov&mdash;simply lovely!&rdquo;
        cried Petritsky. &ldquo;You know his weakness for balls, and he never
        misses a single court ball. He went to a big ball in a new helmet. Have
        you seen the new helmets? Very nice, lighter. Well, so he&rsquo;s
        standing.... No, I say, do listen.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am listening,&rdquo; answered Vronsky, rubbing himself with a
        rough towel.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Up comes the Grand Duchess with some ambassador or other, and, as
        ill-luck would have it, she begins talking to him about the new helmets.
        The Grand Duchess positively wanted to show the new helmet to the
        ambassador. They see our friend standing there.&rdquo; (Petritsky
        mimicked how he was standing with the helmet.) &ldquo;The Grand Duchess
        asked him to give her the helmet; he doesn&rsquo;t give it to her. What
        do you think of that? Well, everyone&rsquo;s winking at him, nodding,
        frowning&mdash;give it to her, do! He doesn&rsquo;t give it to her.
        He&rsquo;s mute as a fish. Only picture it!... Well, the ...
        what&rsquo;s his name, whatever he was ... tries to take the helmet from
        him ... he won&rsquo;t give it up!... He pulls it from him, and hands it
        to the Grand Duchess. &lsquo;Here, your Highness,&rsquo; says he,
        &lsquo;is the new helmet.&rsquo; She turned the helmet the other side
        up, And&mdash;just picture it!&mdash;plop went a pear and sweetmeats out
        of it, two pounds of sweetmeats!... He&rsquo;d been storing them up, the
        darling!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky burst into roars of laughter. And long afterwards, when he was
        talking of other things, he broke out into his healthy laugh, showing
        his strong, close rows of teeth, when he thought of the helmet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having heard all the news, Vronsky, with the assistance of his valet,
        got into his uniform, and went off to report himself. He intended, when
        he had done that, to drive to his brother&rsquo;s and to Betsy&rsquo;s
        and to pay several visits with a view to beginning to go into that
        society where he might meet Madame Karenina. As he always did in
        Petersburg, he left home not meaning to return till late at night.

      <h2>PART TWO</h2>

      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>

      <p>
        At the end of the winter, in the Shtcherbatskys&rsquo; house, a
        consultation was being held, which was to pronounce on the state of
        Kitty&rsquo;s health and the measures to be taken to restore her failing
        strength. She had been ill, and as spring came on she grew worse. The
        family doctor gave her cod liver oil, then iron, then nitrate of silver,
        but as the first and the second and the third were alike in doing no
        good, and as his advice when spring came was to go abroad, a celebrated
        physician was called in. The celebrated physician, a very handsome man,
        still youngish, asked to examine the patient. He maintained, with
        peculiar satisfaction, it seemed, that maiden modesty is a mere relic of
        barbarism, and that nothing could be more natural than for a man still
        youngish to handle a young girl naked. He thought it natural because he
        did it every day, and felt and thought, as it seemed to him, no harm as
        he did it and consequently he considered modesty in the girl not merely
        as a relic of barbarism, but also as an insult to himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was nothing for it but to submit, since, although all the doctors
        had studied in the same school, had read the same books, and learned the
        same science, and though some people said this celebrated doctor was a
        bad doctor, in the princess&rsquo;s household and circle it was for some
        reason accepted that this celebrated doctor alone had some special
        knowledge, and that he alone could save Kitty. After a careful
        examination and sounding of the bewildered patient, dazed with shame,
        the celebrated doctor, having scrupulously washed his hands, was
        standing in the drawing-room talking to the prince. The prince frowned
        and coughed, listening to the doctor. As a man who had seen something of
        life, and neither a fool nor an invalid, he had no faith in medicine,
        and in his heart was furious at the whole farce, specially as he was
        perhaps the only one who fully comprehended the cause of Kitty&rsquo;s
        illness. &ldquo;Conceited blockhead!&rdquo; he thought, as he listened
        to the celebrated doctor&rsquo;s chatter about his daughter&rsquo;s
        symptoms. The doctor was meantime with difficulty restraining the
        expression of his contempt for this old gentleman, and with difficulty
        condescending to the level of his intelligence. He perceived that it was
        no good talking to the old man, and that the principal person in the
        house was the mother. Before her he decided to scatter his pearls. At
        that instant the princess came into the drawing-room with the family
        doctor. The prince withdrew, trying not to show how ridiculous he
        thought the whole performance. The princess was distracted, and did not
        know what to do. She felt she had sinned against Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, doctor, decide our fate,&rdquo; said the princess.
        &ldquo;Tell me everything.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is there hope?&rdquo; she meant to say, but her lips quivered,
        and she could not utter the question. &ldquo;Well, doctor?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Immediately, princess. I will talk it over with my colleague, and
        then I will have the honor of laying my opinion before you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So we had better leave you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;As you please.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The princess went out with a sigh.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the doctors were left alone, the family doctor began timidly
        explaining his opinion, that there was a commencement of tuberculous
        trouble, but ... and so on. The celebrated doctor listened to him, and
        in the middle of his sentence looked at his big gold watch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The commencement of the tuberculous process we are not, as you
        are aware, able to define; till there are cavities, there is nothing
        definite. But we may suspect it. And there are indications;
        malnutrition, nervous excitability, and so on. The question stands thus:
        in presence of indications of tuberculous process, what is to be done to
        maintain nutrition?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But, you know, there are always moral, spiritual causes at the
        back in these cases,&rdquo; the family doctor permitted himself to
        interpolate with a subtle smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s an understood thing,&rdquo; responded the
        celebrated physician, again glancing at his watch. &ldquo;Beg pardon, is
        the Yausky bridge done yet, or shall I have to drive around?&rdquo; he
        asked. &ldquo;Ah! it is. Oh, well, then I can do it in twenty minutes.
        So we were saying the problem may be put thus: to maintain nutrition and
        to give tone to the nerves. The one is in close connection with the
        other, one must attack both sides at once.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And how about a tour abroad?&rdquo; asked the family doctor.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no liking for foreign tours. And take note: if there
        is an early stage of tuberculous process, of which we cannot be certain,
        a foreign tour will be of no use. What is wanted is means of improving
        nutrition, and not for lowering it.&rdquo; And the celebrated doctor
        expounded his plan of treatment with Soden waters, a remedy obviously
        prescribed primarily on the ground that they could do no harm.
      </p>

      <p>
        The family doctor listened attentively and respectfully.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habits,
        the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences. And then the
        mother wishes it,&rdquo; he added.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! Well, in that case, to be sure, let them go. Only, those
        German quacks are mischievous.... They ought to be persuaded.... Well,
        let them go then.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He glanced once more at his watch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! time&rsquo;s up already,&rdquo; And he went to the door. The
        celebrated doctor announced to the princess (a feeling of what was due
        from him dictated his doing so) that he ought to see the patient once
        more.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What! another examination!&rdquo; cried the mother, with horror.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, only a few details, princess.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come this way.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And the mother, accompanied by the doctor, went into the drawing-room to
        Kitty. Wasted and flushed, with a peculiar glitter in her eyes, left
        there by the agony of shame she had been put through, Kitty stood in the
        middle of the room. When the doctor came in she flushed crimson, and her
        eyes filled with tears. All her illness and treatment struck her as a
        thing so stupid, ludicrous even! Doctoring her seemed to her as absurd
        as putting together the pieces of a broken vase. Her heart was broken.
        Why would they try to cure her with pills and powders? But she could not
        grieve her mother, especially as her mother considered herself to blame.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;May I trouble you to sit down, princess?&rdquo; the celebrated
        doctor said to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        He sat down with a smile, facing her, felt her pulse, and again began
        asking her tiresome questions. She answered him, and all at once got up,
        furious.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, doctor, but there is really no object in this. This is
        the third time you&rsquo;ve asked me the same thing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The celebrated doctor did not take offense.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nervous irritability,&rdquo; he said to the princess, when Kitty
        had left the room. &ldquo;However, I had finished....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess, as an
        exceptionally intelligent woman, the condition of the young princess,
        and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters, which were
        certainly harmless. At the question: Should they go abroad? the doctor
        plunged into deep meditation, as though resolving a weighty problem.
        Finally his decision was pronounced: they were to go abroad, but to put
        no faith in foreign quacks, and to apply to him in any need.
      </p>

      <p>
        It seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after
        the doctor had gone. The mother was much more cheerful when she went
        back to her daughter, and Kitty pretended to be more cheerful. She had
        often, almost always, to be pretending now.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Really, I&rsquo;m quite well, mamma. But if you want to go
        abroad, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; she said, and trying to appear interested
        in the proposed tour, she began talking of the preparations for the
        journey.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

      <p>
        Soon after the doctor, Dolly had arrived. She knew that there was to be
        a consultation that day, and though she was only just up after her
        confinement (she had another baby, a little girl, born at the end of the
        winter), though she had trouble and anxiety enough of her own, she had
        left her tiny baby and a sick child, to come and hear Kitty&rsquo;s
        fate, which was to be decided that day.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, well?&rdquo; she said, coming into the drawing-room,
        without taking off her hat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all in good spirits.
        Good news, then?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        They tried to tell her what the doctor had said, but it appeared that
        though the doctor had talked distinctly enough and at great length, it
        was utterly impossible to report what he had said. The only point of
        interest was that it was settled they should go abroad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly could not help sighing. Her dearest friend, her sister, was going
        away. And her life was not a cheerful one. Her relations with Stepan
        Arkadyevitch after their reconciliation had become humiliating. The
        union Anna had cemented turned out to be of no solid character, and
        family harmony was breaking down again at the same point. There had been
        nothing definite, but Stepan Arkadyevitch was hardly ever at home;
        money, too, was hardly ever forthcoming, and Dolly was continually
        tortured by suspicions of infidelity, which she tried to dismiss,
        dreading the agonies of jealousy she had been through already. The first
        onslaught of jealousy, once lived through, could never come back again,
        and even the discovery of infidelities could never now affect her as it
        had the first time. Such a discovery now would only mean breaking up
        family habits, and she let herself be deceived, despising him and still
        more herself, for the weakness. Besides this, the care of her large
        family was a constant worry to her: first, the nursing of her young baby
        did not go well, then the nurse had gone away, now one of the children
        had fallen ill.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, how are all of you?&rdquo; asked her mother.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, mamma, we have plenty of troubles of our own. Lili is ill,
        and I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s scarlatina. I have come here now to hear
        about Kitty, and then I shall shut myself up entirely, if&mdash;God
        forbid&mdash;it should be scarlatina.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The old prince too had come in from his study after the doctor&rsquo;s
        departure, and after presenting his cheek to Dolly, and saying a few
        words to her, he turned to his wife:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How have you settled it? you&rsquo;re going? Well, and what do
        you mean to do with me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I suppose you had better stay here, Alexander,&rdquo; said his
        wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as you like.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mamma, why shouldn&rsquo;t father come with us?&rdquo; said
        Kitty. &ldquo;It would be nicer for him and for us too.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The old prince got up and stroked Kitty&rsquo;s hair. She lifted her
        head and looked at him with a forced smile. It always seemed to her that
        he understood her better than anyone in the family, though he did not
        say much about her. Being the youngest, she was her father&rsquo;s
        favorite, and she fancied that his love gave him insight. When now her
        glance met his blue kindly eyes looking intently at her, it seemed to
        her that he saw right through her, and understood all that was not good
        that was passing within her. Reddening, she stretched out towards him
        expecting a kiss, but he only patted her hair and said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;These stupid chignons! There&rsquo;s no getting at the real
        daughter. One simply strokes the bristles of dead women. Well,
        Dolinka,&rdquo; he turned to his elder daughter, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
        your young buck about, hey?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing, father,&rdquo; answered Dolly, understanding that her
        husband was meant. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always out; I scarcely ever see
        him,&rdquo; she could not resist adding with a sarcastic smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, hasn&rsquo;t he gone into the country yet&mdash;to see about
        selling that forest?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s still getting ready for the journey.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;And so am I
        to be getting ready for a journey too? At your service,&rdquo; he said
        to his wife, sitting down. &ldquo;And I tell you what, Katia,&rdquo; he
        went on to his younger daughter, &ldquo;you must wake up one fine day
        and say to yourself: Why, I&rsquo;m quite well, and merry, and going out
        again with father for an early morning walk in the frost. Hey?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        What her father said seemed simple enough, yet at these words Kitty
        became confused and overcome like a detected criminal. &ldquo;Yes, he
        sees it all, he understands it all, and in these words he&rsquo;s
        telling me that though I&rsquo;m ashamed, I must get over my
        shame.&rdquo; She could not pluck up spirit to make any answer. She
        tried to begin, and all at once burst into tears, and rushed out of the
        room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;See what comes of your jokes!&rdquo; the princess pounced down on
        her husband. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always....&rdquo; she began a string of
        reproaches.
      </p>

      <p>
        The prince listened to the princess&rsquo;s scolding rather a long while
        without speaking, but his face was more and more frowning.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so much to be pitied, poor child, so much to be
        pitied, and you don&rsquo;t feel how it hurts her to hear the slightest
        reference to the cause of it. Ah! to be so mistaken in people!&rdquo;
        said the princess, and by the change in her tone both Dolly and the
        prince knew she was speaking of Vronsky. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why
        there aren&rsquo;t laws against such base, dishonorable people.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, I can&rsquo;t bear to hear you!&rdquo; said the prince
        gloomily, getting up from his low chair, and seeming anxious to get
        away, yet stopping in the doorway. &ldquo;There are laws, madam, and
        since you&rsquo;ve challenged me to it, I&rsquo;ll tell you who&rsquo;s
        to blame for it all: you and you, you and nobody else. Laws against such
        young gallants there have always been, and there still are! Yes, if
        there has been nothing that ought not to have been, old as I am,
        I&rsquo;d have called him out to the barrier, the young dandy. Yes, and
        now you physic her and call in these quacks.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The prince apparently had plenty more to say, but as soon as the
        princess heard his tone she subsided at once, and became penitent, as
        she always did on serious occasions.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexander, Alexander,&rdquo; she whispered, moving to him and
        beginning to weep.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as she began to cry the prince too calmed down. He went up to
        her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s enough, that&rsquo;s enough! You&rsquo;re
        wretched too, I know. It can&rsquo;t be helped. There&rsquo;s no great
        harm done. God is merciful ... thanks....&rdquo; he said, not knowing
        what he was saying, as he responded to the tearful kiss of the princess
        that he felt on his hand. And the prince went out of the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before this, as soon as Kitty went out of the room in tears, Dolly, with
        her motherly, family instincts, had promptly perceived that here a
        woman&rsquo;s work lay before her, and she prepared to do it. She took
        off her hat, and, morally speaking, tucked up her sleeves and prepared
        for action. While her mother was attacking her father, she tried to
        restrain her mother, so far as filial reverence would allow. During the
        prince&rsquo;s outburst she was silent; she felt ashamed for her mother,
        and tender towards her father for so quickly being kind again. But when
        her father left them she made ready for what was the chief thing
        needful&mdash;to go to Kitty and console her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;d been meaning to tell you something for a long while,
        mamma: did you know that Levin meant to make Kitty an offer when he was
        here the last time? He told Stiva so.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what then? I don&rsquo;t understand....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So did Kitty perhaps refuse him?... She didn&rsquo;t tell you
        so?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, she has said nothing to me either of one or the other;
        she&rsquo;s too proud. But I know it&rsquo;s all on account of the
        other.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but suppose she has refused Levin, and she wouldn&rsquo;t
        have refused him if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the other, I know. And
        then, he has deceived her so horribly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        It was too terrible for the princess to think how she had sinned against
        her daughter, and she broke out angrily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I really don&rsquo;t understand! Nowadays they will all go
        their own way, and mothers haven&rsquo;t a word to say in anything, and
        then....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mamma, I&rsquo;ll go up to her.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, do. Did I tell you not to?&rdquo; said her mother.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 3</h3>

      <p>
        When she went into Kitty&rsquo;s little room, a pretty, pink little
        room, full of knick-knacks in <i>vieux saxe,</i> as fresh, and pink, and
        white, and gay as Kitty herself had been two months ago, Dolly
        remembered how they had decorated the room the year before together,
        with what love and gaiety. Her heart turned cold when she saw Kitty
        sitting on a low chair near the door, her eyes fixed immovably on a
        corner of the rug. Kitty glanced at her sister, and the cold, rather
        ill-tempered expression of her face did not change.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going now, and I shall have to keep in and you
        won&rsquo;t be able to come to see me,&rdquo; said Dolly, sitting down
        beside her. &ldquo;I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What about?&rdquo; Kitty asked swiftly, lifting her head in
        dismay.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What should it be, but your trouble?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have no trouble.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nonsense, Kitty. Do you suppose I could help knowing? I know all
        about it. And believe me, it&rsquo;s of so little consequence....
        We&rsquo;ve all been through it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty did not speak, and her face had a stern expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not worth your grieving over him,&rdquo; pursued Darya
        Alexandrovna, coming straight to the point.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, because he has treated me with contempt,&rdquo; said Kitty,
        in a breaking voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of it! Please, don&rsquo;t
        talk of it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But who can have told you so? No one has said that. I&rsquo;m
        certain he was in love with you, and would still be in love with you, if
        it hadn&rsquo;t....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, the most awful thing of all for me is this
        sympathizing!&rdquo; shrieked Kitty, suddenly flying into a passion. She
        turned round on her chair, flushed crimson, and rapidly moving her
        fingers, pinched the clasp of her belt first with one hand and then with
        the other. Dolly knew this trick her sister had of clenching her hands
        when she was much excited; she knew, too, that in moments of excitement
        Kitty was capable of forgetting herself and saying a great deal too
        much, and Dolly would have soothed her, but it was too late.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What, what is it you want to make me feel, eh?&rdquo; said Kitty
        quickly. &ldquo;That I&rsquo;ve been in love with a man who didn&rsquo;t
        care a straw for me, and that I&rsquo;m dying of love for him? And this
        is said to me by my own sister, who imagines that ... that ... that
        she&rsquo;s sympathizing with me!... I don&rsquo;t want these
        condolences and humbug!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kitty, you&rsquo;re unjust.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why are you tormenting me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I ... quite the contrary ... I see you&rsquo;re
        unhappy....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But Kitty in her fury did not hear her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to grieve over and be comforted about. I am
        too proud ever to allow myself to care for a man who does not love
        me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t say so either.... Only one thing. Tell me the
        truth,&rdquo; said Darya Alexandrovna, taking her by the hand:
        &ldquo;tell me, did Levin speak to you?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The mention of Levin&rsquo;s name seemed to deprive Kitty of the last
        vestige of self-control. She leaped up from her chair, and flinging her
        clasp on the ground, she gesticulated rapidly with her hands and said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why bring Levin in too? I can&rsquo;t understand what you want to
        torment me for. I&rsquo;ve told you, and I say it again, that I have
        some pride, and never, <i>never</i> would I do as you&rsquo;re
        doing&mdash;go back to a man who&rsquo;s deceived you, who has cared for
        another woman. I can&rsquo;t understand it! You may, but I
        can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And saying these words she glanced at her sister, and seeing that Dolly
        sat silent, her head mournfully bowed, Kitty, instead of running out of
        the room as she had meant to do, sat down near the door, and hid her
        face in her handkerchief.
      </p>

      <p>
        The silence lasted for two minutes: Dolly was thinking of herself. That
        humiliation of which she was always conscious came back to her with a
        peculiar bitterness when her sister reminded her of it. She had not
        looked for such cruelty in her sister, and she was angry with her. But
        suddenly she heard the rustle of a skirt, and with it the sound of
        heart-rending, smothered sobbing, and felt arms about her neck. Kitty
        was on her knees before her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dolinka, I am so, so wretched!&rdquo; she whispered penitently.
        And the sweet face covered with tears hid itself in Darya
        Alexandrovna&rsquo;s skirt.
      </p>

      <p>
        As though tears were the indispensable oil, without which the machinery
        of mutual confidence could not run smoothly between the two sisters, the
        sisters after their tears talked, not of what was uppermost in their
        minds, but, though they talked of outside matters, they understood each
        other. Kitty knew that the words she had uttered in anger about her
        husband&rsquo;s infidelity and her humiliating position had cut her poor
        sister to the heart, but that she had forgiven her. Dolly for her part
        knew all she had wanted to find out. She felt certain that her surmises
        were correct; that Kitty&rsquo;s misery, her inconsolable misery, was
        due precisely to the fact that Levin had made her an offer and she had
        refused him, and Vronsky had deceived her, and that she was fully
        prepared to love Levin and to detest Vronsky. Kitty said not a word of
        that; she talked of nothing but her spiritual condition.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have nothing to make me miserable,&rdquo; she said, getting
        calmer; &ldquo;but can you understand that everything has become
        hateful, loathsome, coarse to me, and I myself most of all? You
        can&rsquo;t imagine what loathsome thoughts I have about
        everything.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, whatever loathsome thoughts can you have?&rdquo; asked
        Dolly, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The most utterly loathsome and coarse: I can&rsquo;t tell you.
        It&rsquo;s not unhappiness, or low spirits, but much worse. As though
        everything that was good in me was all hidden away, and nothing was left
        but the most loathsome. Come, how am I to tell you?&rdquo; she went on,
        seeing the puzzled look in her sister&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Father began
        saying something to me just now.... It seems to me he thinks all I want
        is to be married. Mother takes me to a ball: it seems to me she only
        takes me to get me married off as soon as may be, and be rid of me. I
        know it&rsquo;s not the truth, but I can&rsquo;t drive away such
        thoughts. Eligible suitors, as they call them&mdash;I can&rsquo;t bear
        to see them. It seems to me they&rsquo;re taking stock of me and summing
        me up. In old days to go anywhere in a ball dress was a simple joy to
        me, I admired myself; now I feel ashamed and awkward. And then! The
        doctor.... Then....&rdquo; Kitty hesitated; she wanted to say further
        that ever since this change had taken place in her, Stepan Arkadyevitch
        had become insufferably repulsive to her, and that she could not see him
        without the grossest and most hideous conceptions rising before her
        imagination.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, everything presents itself to me, in the coarsest, most
        loathsome light,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my illness.
        Perhaps it will pass off.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t think about it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;m never happy except with the
        children at your house.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a pity you can&rsquo;t be with me!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m coming. I&rsquo;ve had scarlatina, and
        I&rsquo;ll persuade mamma to let me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty insisted on having her way, and went to stay at her sister&rsquo;s
        and nursed the children all through the scarlatina, for scarlatina it
        turned out to be. The two sisters brought all the six children
        successfully through it, but Kitty was no better in health, and in Lent
        the Shtcherbatskys went abroad.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 4</h3>

      <p>
        The highest Petersburg society is essentially one: in it everyone knows
        everyone else, everyone even visits everyone else. But this great set
        has its subdivisions. Anna Arkadyevna Karenina had friends and close
        ties in three different circles of this highest society. One circle was
        her husband&rsquo;s government official set, consisting of his
        colleagues and subordinates, brought together in the most various and
        capricious manner, and belonging to different social strata. Anna found
        it difficult now to recall the feeling of almost awe-stricken reverence
        which she had at first entertained for these persons. Now she knew all
        of them as people know one another in a country town; she knew their
        habits and weaknesses, and where the shoe pinched each one of them. She
        knew their relations with one another and with the head authorities,
        knew who was for whom, and how each one maintained his position, and
        where they agreed and disagreed. But the circle of political, masculine
        interests had never interested her, in spite of countess Lidia
        Ivanovna&rsquo;s influence, and she avoided it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another little set with which Anna was in close relations was the one by
        means of which Alexey Alexandrovitch had made his career. The center of
        this circle was the Countess Lidia Ivanovna. It was a set made up of
        elderly, ugly, benevolent, and godly women, and clever, learned, and
        ambitious men. One of the clever people belonging to the set had called
        it &ldquo;the conscience of Petersburg society.&rdquo; Alexey
        Alexandrovitch had the highest esteem for this circle, and Anna with her
        special gift for getting on with everyone, had in the early days of her
        life in Petersburg made friends in this circle also. Now, since her
        return from Moscow, she had come to feel this set insufferable. It
        seemed to her that both she and all of them were insincere, and she felt
        so bored and ill at ease in that world that she went to see the Countess
        Lidia Ivanovna as little as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        The third circle with which Anna had ties was preeminently the
        fashionable world&mdash;the world of balls, of dinners, of sumptuous
        dresses, the world that hung on to the court with one hand, so as to
        avoid sinking to the level of the demi-monde. For the demi-monde the
        members of that fashionable world believed that they despised, though
        their tastes were not merely similar, but in fact identical. Her
        connection with this circle was kept up through Princess Betsy
        Tverskaya, her cousin&rsquo;s wife, who had an income of a hundred and
        twenty thousand roubles, and who had taken a great fancy to Anna ever
        since she first came out, showed her much attention, and drew her into
        her set, making fun of Countess Lidia Ivanovna&rsquo;s coterie.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m old and ugly I&rsquo;ll be the same,&rdquo; Betsy
        used to say; &ldquo;but for a pretty young woman like you it&rsquo;s
        early days for that house of charity.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna had at first avoided as far as she could Princess Tverskaya&rsquo;s
        world, because it necessitated an expenditure beyond her means, and
        besides in her heart she preferred the first circle. But since her visit
        to Moscow she had done quite the contrary. She avoided her
        serious-minded friends, and went out into the fashionable world. There
        she met Vronsky, and experienced an agitating joy at those meetings. She
        met Vronsky specially often at Betsy&rsquo;s for Betsy was a Vronsky by
        birth and his cousin. Vronsky was everywhere where he had any chance of
        meeting Anna, and speaking to her, when he could, of his love. She gave
        him no encouragement, but every time she met him there surged up in her
        heart that same feeling of quickened life that had come upon her that
        day in the railway carriage when she saw him for the first time. She was
        conscious herself that her delight sparkled in her eyes and curved her
        lips into a smile, and she could not quench the expression of this
        delight.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first Anna sincerely believed that she was displeased with him for
        daring to pursue her. Soon after her return from Moscow, on arriving at
        a <i>soirée</i>
        where she had expected to meet him, and not finding him there, she
        realized distinctly from the rush of disappointment that she had been
        deceiving herself, and that this pursuit was not merely not distasteful
        to her, but that it made the whole interest of her life.
      </p>

      <p class="p2">
        The celebrated singer was singing for the second time, and all the
        fashionable world was in the theater. Vronsky, seeing his cousin from
        his stall in the front row, did not wait till the
        <i>entr&rsquo;acte</i>, but went to her box.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come to dinner?&rdquo; she said to him.
        &ldquo;I marvel at the second sight of lovers,&rdquo; she added with a
        smile, so that no one but he could hear; &ldquo;<i
          >she wasn&rsquo;t there</i
        >. But come after the opera.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky looked inquiringly at her. She nodded. He thanked her by a
        smile, and sat down beside her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But how I remember your jeers!&rdquo; continued Princess Betsy,
        who took a peculiar pleasure in following up this passion to a
        successful issue. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s become of all that? You&rsquo;re
        caught, my dear boy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my one desire, to be caught,&rdquo; answered
        Vronsky, with his serene, good-humored smile. &ldquo;If I complain of
        anything it&rsquo;s only that I&rsquo;m not caught enough, to tell the
        truth. I begin to lose hope.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, whatever hope can you have?&rdquo; said Betsy, offended on
        behalf of her friend. &ldquo;<i>Entendons nous....</i>&rdquo; But in her
        eyes there were gleams of light that betrayed that she understood
        perfectly and precisely as he did what hope he might have.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; said Vronsky, laughing and showing his even
        rows of teeth. &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he added, taking an opera-glass
        out of her hand, and proceeding to scrutinize, over her bare shoulder,
        the row of boxes facing them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m becoming
        ridiculous.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He was very well aware that he ran no risk of being ridiculous in the
        eyes of Betsy or any other fashionable people. He was very well aware
        that in their eyes the position of an unsuccessful lover of a girl, or
        of any woman free to marry, might be ridiculous. But the position of a
        man pursuing a married woman, and, regardless of everything, staking his
        life on drawing her into adultery, has something fine and grand about
        it, and can never be ridiculous; and so it was with a proud and gay
        smile under his mustaches that he lowered the opera-glass and looked at
        his cousin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But why was it you didn&rsquo;t come to dinner?&rdquo; she said,
        admiring him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I must tell you about that. I was busily employed, and doing
        what, do you suppose? I&rsquo;ll give you a hundred guesses, a thousand
        ... you&rsquo;d never guess. I&rsquo;ve been reconciling a husband with
        a man who&rsquo;d insulted his wife. Yes, really!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, did you succeed?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Almost.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You really must tell me about it,&rdquo; she said, getting up.
        &ldquo;Come to me in the next <i>entr&rsquo;acte.</i>&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;m going to the French theater.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;From Nilsson?&rdquo; Betsy queried in horror, though she could
        not herself have distinguished Nilsson&rsquo;s voice from any chorus
        girl&rsquo;s.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;ve an appointment there, all to do
        with my mission of peace.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Blessed are the peacemakers; theirs is the kingdom of
        heaven,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Betsy, vaguely recollecting she had heard
        some similar saying from someone. &ldquo;Very well, then, sit down, and
        tell me what it&rsquo;s all about.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And she sat down again.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 5</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This is rather indiscreet, but it&rsquo;s so good it&rsquo;s an
        awful temptation to tell the story,&rdquo; said Vronsky, looking at her
        with his laughing eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to mention any
        names.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I shall guess, so much the better.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, listen: two festive young men were driving&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Officers of your regiment, of course?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say they were officers,&mdash;two young men who
        had been lunching.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In other words, drinking.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Possibly. They were driving on their way to dinner with a friend
        in the most festive state of mind. And they beheld a pretty woman in a
        hired sledge; she overtakes them, looks round at them, and, so they
        fancy anyway, nods to them and laughs. They, of course, follow her. They
        gallop at full speed. To their amazement, the fair one alights at the
        entrance of the very house to which they were going. The fair one darts
        upstairs to the top story. They get a glimpse of red lips under a short
        veil, and exquisite little feet.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You describe it with such feeling that I fancy you must be one of
        the two.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And after what you said, just now! Well, the young men go in to
        their comrade&rsquo;s; he was giving a farewell dinner. There they
        certainly did drink a little too much, as one always does at farewell
        dinners. And at dinner they inquire who lives at the top in that house.
        No one knows; only their host&rsquo;s valet, in answer to their inquiry
        whether any &lsquo;young ladies&rsquo; are living on the top floor,
        answered that there were a great many of them about there. After dinner
        the two young men go into their host&rsquo;s study, and write a letter
        to the unknown fair one. They compose an ardent epistle, a declaration
        in fact, and they carry the letter upstairs themselves, so as to
        elucidate whatever might appear not perfectly intelligible in the
        letter.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why are you telling me these horrible stories? Well?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They ring. A maid-servant opens the door, they hand her the
        letter, and assure the maid that they&rsquo;re both so in love that
        they&rsquo;ll die on the spot at the door. The maid, stupefied, carries
        in their messages. All at once a gentleman appears with whiskers like
        sausages, as red as a lobster, announces that there is no one living in
        the flat except his wife, and sends them both about their
        business.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you know he had whiskers like sausages, as you say?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, you shall hear. I&rsquo;ve just been to make peace between
        them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and what then?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most interesting part of the story. It appears
        that it&rsquo;s a happy couple, a government clerk and his lady. The
        government clerk lodges a complaint, and I became a mediator, and such a
        mediator!... I assure you Talleyrand couldn&rsquo;t hold a candle to
        me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, where was the difficulty?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, you shall hear.... We apologize in due form: we are in
        despair, we entreat forgiveness for the unfortunate misunderstanding.
        The government clerk with the sausages begins to melt, but he, too,
        desires to express his sentiments, and as soon as ever he begins to
        express them, he begins to get hot and say nasty things, and again
        I&rsquo;m obliged to trot out all my diplomatic talents. I allowed that
        their conduct was bad, but I urged him to take into consideration their
        heedlessness, their youth; then, too, the young men had only just been
        lunching together. &lsquo;You understand. They regret it deeply, and beg
        you to overlook their misbehavior.&rsquo; The government clerk was
        softened once more. &lsquo;I consent, count, and am ready to overlook
        it; but you perceive that my wife&mdash;my wife&rsquo;s a respectable
        woman&mdash;has been exposed to the persecution, and insults, and
        effrontery of young upstarts, scoundrels....&rsquo; And you must
        understand, the young upstarts are present all the while, and I have to
        keep the peace between them. Again I call out all my diplomacy, and
        again as soon as the thing was about at an end, our friend the
        government clerk gets hot and red, and his sausages stand on end with
        wrath, and once more I launch out into diplomatic wiles.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, he must tell you this story!&rdquo; said Betsy, laughing, to
        a lady who came into her box. &ldquo;He has been making me laugh
        so.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, <i>bonne chance</i>!&rdquo; she added, giving Vronsky one
        finger of the hand in which she held her fan, and with a shrug of her
        shoulders she twitched down the bodice of her gown that had worked up,
        so as to be duly naked as she moved forward towards the footlights into
        the light of the gas, and the sight of all eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky drove to the French theater, where he really had to see the
        colonel of his regiment, who never missed a single performance there. He
        wanted to see him, to report on the result of his mediation, which had
        occupied and amused him for the last three days. Petritsky, whom he
        liked, was implicated in the affair, and the other culprit was a capital
        fellow and first-rate comrade, who had lately joined the regiment, the
        young Prince Kedrov. And what was most important, the interests of the
        regiment were involved in it too.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both the young men were in Vronsky&rsquo;s company. The colonel of the
        regiment was waited upon by the government clerk, Venden, with a
        complaint against his officers, who had insulted his wife. His young
        wife, so Venden told the story&mdash;he had been married half a
        year&mdash;was at church with her mother, and suddenly overcome by
        indisposition, arising from her interesting condition, she could not
        remain standing, she drove home in the first sledge, a smart-looking
        one, she came across. On the spot the officers set off in pursuit of
        her; she was alarmed, and feeling still more unwell, ran up the
        staircase home. Venden himself, on returning from his office, heard a
        ring at their bell and voices, went out, and seeing the intoxicated
        officers with a letter, he had turned them out. He asked for exemplary
        punishment.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; said the colonel to
        Vronsky, whom he had invited to come and see him.
        &ldquo;Petritsky&rsquo;s becoming impossible. Not a week goes by without
        some scandal. This government clerk won&rsquo;t let it drop, he&rsquo;ll
        go on with the thing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky saw all the thanklessness of the business, and that there could
        be no question of a duel in it, that everything must be done to soften
        the government clerk, and hush the matter up. The colonel had called in
        Vronsky just because he knew him to be an honorable and intelligent man,
        and, more than all, a man who cared for the honor of the regiment. They
        talked it over, and decided that Petritsky and Kedrov must go with
        Vronsky to Venden&rsquo;s to apologize. The colonel and Vronsky were
        both fully aware that Vronsky&rsquo;s name and rank would be sure to
        contribute greatly to the softening of the injured husband&rsquo;s
        feelings.
      </p>

      <p>
        And these two influences were not in fact without effect; though the
        result remained, as Vronsky had described, uncertain.
      </p>

      <p>
        On reaching the French theater, Vronsky retired to the foyer with the
        colonel, and reported to him his success, or non-success. The colonel,
        thinking it all over, made up his mind not to pursue the matter further,
        but then for his own satisfaction proceeded to cross-examine Vronsky
        about his interview; and it was a long while before he could restrain
        his laughter, as Vronsky described how the government clerk, after
        subsiding for a while, would suddenly flare up again, as he recalled the
        details, and how Vronsky, at the last half word of conciliation,
        skillfully manœuvered a retreat, shoving Petritsky out before him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a disgraceful story, but killing. Kedrov really
        can&rsquo;t fight the gentleman! Was he so awfully hot?&rdquo; he
        commented, laughing. &ldquo;But what do you say to Claire today?
        She&rsquo;s marvelous,&rdquo; he went on, speaking of a new French
        actress. &ldquo;However often you see her, every day she&rsquo;s
        different. It&rsquo;s only the French who can do that.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 6</h3>

      <p>
        Princess Betsy drove home from the theater, without waiting for the end
        of the last act. She had only just time to go into her dressing-room,
        sprinkle her long, pale face with powder, rub it, set her dress to
        rights, and order tea in the big drawing-room, when one after another
        carriages drove up to her huge house in Bolshaia Morskaia. Her guests
        stepped out at the wide entrance, and the stout porter, who used to read
        the newspapers in the mornings behind the glass door, to the edification
        of the passers-by, noiselessly opened the immense door, letting the
        visitors pass by him into the house.
      </p>

      <p>
        Almost at the same instant the hostess, with freshly arranged coiffure
        and freshened face, walked in at one door and her guests at the other
        door of the drawing-room, a large room with dark walls, downy rugs, and
        a brightly lighted table, gleaming with the light of candles, white
        cloth, silver samovar, and transparent china tea-things.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hostess sat down at the table and took off her gloves. Chairs were
        set with the aid of footmen, moving almost imperceptibly about the room;
        the party settled itself, divided into two groups: one round the samovar
        near the hostess, the other at the opposite end of the drawing-room,
        round the handsome wife of an ambassador, in black velvet, with sharply
        defined black eyebrows. In both groups conversation wavered, as it
        always does, for the first few minutes, broken up by meetings,
        greetings, offers of tea, and as it were, feeling about for something to
        rest upon.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s exceptionally good as an actress; one can see
        she&rsquo;s studied Kaulbach,&rdquo; said a diplomatic attaché in the
        group round the ambassador&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;Did you notice how she
        fell down?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, please, don&rsquo;t let us talk about Nilsson! No one can
        possibly say anything new about her,&rdquo; said a fat, red-faced,
        flaxen-headed lady, without eyebrows and chignon, wearing an old silk
        dress. This was Princess Myakaya, noted for her simplicity and the
        roughness of her manners, and nicknamed <i>enfant terrible</i>. Princess
        Myakaya, sitting in the middle between the two groups, and listening to
        both, took part in the conversation first of one and then of the other.
        &ldquo;Three people have used that very phrase about Kaulbach to me
        today already, just as though they had made a compact about it. And I
        can&rsquo;t see why they liked that remark so.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The conversation was cut short by this observation, and a new subject
        had to be thought of again.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do tell me something amusing but not spiteful,&rdquo; said the
        ambassador&rsquo;s wife, a great proficient in the art of that elegant
        conversation called by the English <i>small talk</i>. She addressed the
        attaché, who was at a loss now what to begin upon.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They say that that&rsquo;s a difficult task, that nothing&rsquo;s
        amusing that isn&rsquo;t spiteful,&rdquo; he began with a smile.
        &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll try. Get me a subject. It all lies in the subject.
        If a subject&rsquo;s given me, it&rsquo;s easy to spin something round
        it. I often think that the celebrated talkers of the last century would
        have found it difficult to talk cleverly now. Everything clever is so
        stale....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That has been said long ago,&rdquo; the ambassador&rsquo;s wife
        interrupted him, laughing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The conversation began amiably, but just because it was too amiable, it
        came to a stop again. They had to have recourse to the sure,
        never-failing topic&mdash;gossip.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s something Louis Quinze about
        Tushkevitch?&rdquo; he said, glancing towards a handsome, fair-haired
        young man, standing at the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes! He&rsquo;s in the same style as the drawing-room and
        that&rsquo;s why it is he&rsquo;s so often here.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This conversation was maintained, since it rested on allusions to what
        could not be talked of in that room&mdash;that is to say, of the
        relations of Tushkevitch with their hostess.
      </p>

      <p>
        Round the samovar and the hostess the conversation had been meanwhile
        vacillating in just the same way between three inevitable topics: the
        latest piece of public news, the theater, and scandal. It, too, came
        finally to rest on the last topic, that is, ill-natured gossip.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you heard the Maltishtcheva woman&mdash;the mother, not the
        daughter&mdash;has ordered a costume in <i>diable rose</i> color?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nonsense! No, that&rsquo;s too lovely!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I wonder that with her sense&mdash;for she&rsquo;s not a fool,
        you know&mdash;that she doesn&rsquo;t see how funny she is.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone had something to say in censure or ridicule of the luckless
        Madame Maltishtcheva, and the conversation crackled merrily, like a
        burning faggot-stack.
      </p>

      <p>
        The husband of Princess Betsy, a good-natured fat man, an ardent
        collector of engravings, hearing that his wife had visitors, came into
        the drawing-room before going to his club. Stepping noiselessly over the
        thick rugs, he went up to Princess Myakaya.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How did you like Nilsson?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, how can you steal upon anyone like that! How you startled
        me!&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t talk to me about the
        opera; you know nothing about music. I&rsquo;d better meet you on your
        own ground, and talk about your majolica and engravings. Come now, what
        treasure have you been buying lately at the old curiosity shops?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Would you like me to show you? But you don&rsquo;t understand
        such things.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, do show me! I&rsquo;ve been learning about them at
        those&mdash;what&rsquo;s their names?... the bankers ... they&rsquo;ve
        some splendid engravings. They showed them to us.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, have you been at the Schützburgs?&rdquo; asked the hostess
        from the samovar.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, <i>ma chère</i>. They asked my husband and me to dinner, and
        told us the sauce at that dinner cost a hundred pounds,&rdquo; Princess
        Myakaya said, speaking loudly, and conscious everyone was listening;
        &ldquo;and very nasty sauce it was, some green mess. We had to ask them,
        and I made them sauce for eighteen pence, and everybody was very much
        pleased with it. I can&rsquo;t run to hundred-pound sauces.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s unique!&rdquo; said the lady of the house.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Marvelous!&rdquo; said someone.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sensation produced by Princess Myakaya&rsquo;s speeches was always
        unique, and the secret of the sensation she produced lay in the fact
        that though she spoke not always appropriately, as now, she said simple
        things with some sense in them. In the society in which she lived such
        plain statements produced the effect of the wittiest epigram. Princess
        Myakaya could never see why it had that effect, but she knew it had, and
        took advantage of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        As everyone had been listening while Princess Myakaya spoke, and so the
        conversation around the ambassador&rsquo;s wife had dropped, Princess
        Betsy tried to bring the whole party together, and turned to the
        ambassador&rsquo;s wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you really not have tea? You should come over here by
        us.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re very happy here,&rdquo; the ambassador&rsquo;s
        wife responded with a smile, and she went on with the conversation that
        had been begun.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was a very agreeable conversation. They were criticizing the
        Karenins, husband and wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna is quite changed since her stay in Moscow. There&rsquo;s
        something strange about her,&rdquo; said her friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The great change is that she brought back with her the shadow of
        Alexey Vronsky,&rdquo; said the ambassador&rsquo;s wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what of it? There&rsquo;s a fable of Grimm&rsquo;s about a
        man without a shadow, a man who&rsquo;s lost his shadow. And
        that&rsquo;s his punishment for something. I never could understand how
        it was a punishment. But a woman must dislike being without a
        shadow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but women with a shadow usually come to a bad end,&rdquo;
        said Anna&rsquo;s friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Bad luck to your tongue!&rdquo; said Princess Myakaya suddenly.
        &ldquo;Madame Karenina&rsquo;s a splendid woman. I don&rsquo;t like her
        husband, but I like her very much.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you like her husband? He&rsquo;s such a
        remarkable man,&rdquo; said the ambassador&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;My
        husband says there are few statesmen like him in Europe.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And my husband tells me just the same, but I don&rsquo;t believe
        it,&rdquo; said Princess Myakaya. &ldquo;If our husbands didn&rsquo;t
        talk to us, we should see the facts as they are. Alexey Alexandrovitch,
        to my thinking, is simply a fool. I say it in a whisper ... but
        doesn&rsquo;t it really make everything clear? Before, when I was told
        to consider him clever, I kept looking for his ability, and thought
        myself a fool for not seeing it; but directly I said,
        <i>he&rsquo;s a fool,</i> though only in a whisper, everything&rsquo;s
        explained, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How spiteful you are today!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not a bit. I&rsquo;d no other way out of it. One of the two had
        to be a fool. And, well, you know one can&rsquo;t say that of
        oneself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;No one is satisfied with his fortune, and everyone is
        satisfied with his wit.&rsquo;&rdquo; The attaché repeated the French
        saying.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it, just it,&rdquo; Princess Myakaya turned to
        him. &ldquo;But the point is that I won&rsquo;t abandon Anna to your
        mercies. She&rsquo;s so nice, so charming. How can she help it if
        they&rsquo;re all in love with her, and follow her about like
        shadows?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I had no idea of blaming her for it,&rdquo; Anna&rsquo;s
        friend said in self-defense.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If no one follows us about like a shadow, that&rsquo;s no proof
        that we&rsquo;ve any right to blame her.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And having duly disposed of Anna&rsquo;s friend, the Princess Myakaya
        got up, and together with the ambassador&rsquo;s wife, joined the group
        at the table, where the conversation was dealing with the king of
        Prussia.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What wicked gossip were you talking over there?&rdquo; asked
        Betsy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;About the Karenins. The princess gave us a sketch of Alexey
        Alexandrovitch,&rdquo; said the ambassador&rsquo;s wife with a smile, as
        she sat down at the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Pity we didn&rsquo;t hear it!&rdquo; said Princess Betsy,
        glancing towards the door. &ldquo;Ah, here you are at last!&rdquo; she
        said, turning with a smile to Vronsky, as he came in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky was not merely acquainted with all the persons whom he was
        meeting here; he saw them all every day; and so he came in with the
        quiet manner with which one enters a room full of people from whom one
        has only just parted.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where do I come from?&rdquo; he said, in answer to a question
        from the ambassador&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no help for
        it, I must confess. From the <i>opera bouffe</i>. I do believe
        I&rsquo;ve seen it a hundred times, and always with fresh enjoyment.
        It&rsquo;s exquisite! I know it&rsquo;s disgraceful, but I go to sleep
        at the opera, and I sit out the <i>opera bouffe</i> to the last minute,
        and enjoy it. This evening....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He mentioned a French actress, and was going to tell something about
        her; but the ambassador&rsquo;s wife, with playful horror, cut him
        short.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t tell us about that horror.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All right, I won&rsquo;t especially as everyone knows those
        horrors.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the
        correct thing, like the opera,&rdquo; chimed in Princess Myakaya.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 7</h3>

      <p>
        Steps were heard at the door, and Princess Betsy, knowing it was Madame
        Karenina, glanced at Vronsky. He was looking towards the door, and his
        face wore a strange new expression. Joyfully, intently, and at the same
        time timidly, he gazed at the approaching figure, and slowly he rose to
        his feet. Anna walked into the drawing-room. Holding herself extremely
        erect, as always, looking straight before her, and moving with her
        swift, resolute, and light step, that distinguished her from all other
        society women, she crossed the short space to her hostess, shook hands
        with her, smiled, and with the same smile looked around at Vronsky.
        Vronsky bowed low and pushed a chair up for her.
      </p>

      <p>
        She acknowledged this only by a slight nod, flushed a little, and
        frowned. But immediately, while rapidly greeting her acquaintances, and
        shaking the hands proffered to her, she addressed Princess Betsy:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have been at Countess Lidia&rsquo;s, and meant to have come
        here earlier, but I stayed on. Sir John was there. He&rsquo;s very
        interesting.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s this missionary?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; he told us about the life in India, most interesting
        things.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The conversation, interrupted by her coming in, flickered up again like
        the light of a lamp being blown out.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir John! Yes, Sir John; I&rsquo;ve seen him. He speaks well. The
        Vlassieva girl&rsquo;s quite in love with him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And is it true the younger Vlassieva girl&rsquo;s to marry
        Topov?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, they say it&rsquo;s quite a settled thing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I wonder at the parents! They say it&rsquo;s a marriage for
        love.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For love? What antediluvian notions you have! Can one talk of
        love in these days?&rdquo; said the ambassador&rsquo;s wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done? It&rsquo;s a foolish old fashion
        that&rsquo;s kept up still,&rdquo; said Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So much the worse for those who keep up the fashion. The only
        happy marriages I know are marriages of prudence.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages
        flies away like dust just because that passion turns up that they have
        refused to recognize,&rdquo; said Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties
        have sown their wild oats already. That&rsquo;s like
        scarlatina&mdash;one has to go through it and get it over.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then they ought to find out how to vaccinate for love, like
        smallpox.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I was in love in my young days with a deacon,&rdquo; said the
        Princess Myakaya. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it did me any
        good.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; I imagine, joking apart, that to know love, one must make
        mistakes and then correct them,&rdquo; said Princess Betsy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Even after marriage?&rdquo; said the ambassador&rsquo;s wife
        playfully.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s never too late to mend.&rsquo;&rdquo; The
        attaché repeated the English proverb.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; Betsy agreed; &ldquo;one must make mistakes and
        correct them. What do you think about it?&rdquo; she turned to Anna,
        who, with a faintly perceptible resolute smile on her lips, was
        listening in silence to the conversation.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Anna, playing with the glove she had taken
        off, &ldquo;I think ... of so many men, so many minds, certainly so many
        hearts, so many kinds of love.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky was gazing at Anna, and with a fainting heart waiting for what
        she would say. He sighed as after a danger escaped when she uttered
        these words.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna suddenly turned to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I have had a letter from Moscow. They write me that Kitty
        Shtcherbatskaya&rsquo;s very ill.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Vronsky, knitting his brows.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna looked sternly at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t interest you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;On the contrary, it does, very much. What was it exactly they
        told you, if I may know?&rdquo; he questioned.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna got up and went to Betsy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Give me a cup of tea,&rdquo; she said, standing at her table.
      </p>

      <p>
        While Betsy was pouring out the tea, Vronsky went up to Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it they write to you?&rdquo; he repeated.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I often think men have no understanding of what&rsquo;s not
        honorable though they&rsquo;re always talking of it,&rdquo; said Anna,
        without answering him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to tell you so a long
        while,&rdquo; she added, and moving a few steps away, she sat down at a
        table in a corner covered with albums.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand the meaning of your words,&rdquo;
        he said, handing her the cup.
      </p>

      <p>
        She glanced towards the sofa beside her, and he instantly sat down.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I have been wanting to tell you,&rdquo; she said, not
        looking at him. &ldquo;You behaved wrongly, very wrongly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you suppose I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve acted wrongly?
        But who was the cause of my doing so?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you say that to me for?&rdquo; she said, glancing
        severely at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You know what for,&rdquo; he answered boldly and joyfully,
        meeting her glance and not dropping his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not he, but she, was confused.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That only shows you have no heart,&rdquo; she said. But her eyes
        said that she knew he had a heart, and that was why she was afraid of
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What you spoke of just now was a mistake, and not love.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Remember that I have forbidden you to utter that word, that
        hateful word,&rdquo; said Anna, with a shudder. But at once she felt
        that by that very word &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; she had shown that she
        acknowledged certain rights over him, and by that very fact was
        encouraging him to speak of love. &ldquo;I have long meant to tell you
        this,&rdquo; she went on, looking resolutely into his eyes, and hot all
        over from the burning flush on her cheeks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come on
        purpose this evening, knowing I should meet you. I have come to tell you
        that this must end. I have never blushed before anyone, and you force me
        to feel to blame for something.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked at her and was struck by a new spiritual beauty in her face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you wish of me?&rdquo; he said simply and seriously.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I want you to go to Moscow and ask for Kitty&rsquo;s
        forgiveness,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t wish that?&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        He saw she was saying what she forced herself to say, not what she
        wanted to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you love me, as you say,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;do so
        that I may be at peace.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        His face grew radiant.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that you&rsquo;re all my life to me? But I
        know no peace, and I can&rsquo;t give it to you; all myself&mdash;and
        love ... yes. I can&rsquo;t think of you and myself apart. You and I are
        one to me. And I see no chance before us of peace for me or for you. I
        see a chance of despair, of wretchedness ... or I see a chance of bliss,
        what bliss!... Can it be there&rsquo;s no chance of it?&rdquo; he
        murmured with his lips; but she heard.
      </p>

      <p>
        She strained every effort of her mind to say what ought to be said. But
        instead of that she let her eyes rest on him, full of love, and made no
        answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s come!&rdquo; he thought in ecstasy. &ldquo;When I was
        beginning to despair, and it seemed there would be no
        end&mdash;it&rsquo;s come! She loves me! She owns it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then do this for me: never say such things to me, and let us be
        friends,&rdquo; she said in words; but her eyes spoke quite differently.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Friends we shall never be, you know that yourself. Whether we
        shall be the happiest or the wretchedest of people&mdash;that&rsquo;s in
        your hands.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She would have said something, but he interrupted her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I ask one thing only: I ask for the right to hope, to suffer as I
        do. But if even that cannot be, command me to disappear, and I
        disappear. You shall not see me if my presence is distasteful to
        you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to drive you away.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Only don&rsquo;t change anything, leave everything as it
        is,&rdquo; he said in a shaky voice. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your
        husband.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At that instant Alexey Alexandrovitch did in fact walk into the room
        with his calm, awkward gait.
      </p>

      <p>
        Glancing at his wife and Vronsky, he went up to the lady of the house,
        and sitting down for a cup of tea, began talking in his deliberate,
        always audible voice, in his habitual tone of banter, ridiculing
        someone.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Your Rambouillet is in full conclave,&rdquo; he said, looking
        round at all the party; &ldquo;the graces and the muses.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But Princess Betsy could not endure that tone of
        his&mdash;&ldquo;sneering,&rdquo; as she called it, using the English
        word, and like a skillful hostess she at once brought him into a serious
        conversation on the subject of universal conscription. Alexey
        Alexandrovitch was immediately interested in the subject, and began
        seriously defending the new imperial decree against Princess Betsy, who
        had attacked it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky and Anna still sat at the little table.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This is getting indecorous,&rdquo; whispered one lady, with an
        expressive glance at Madame Karenina, Vronsky, and her husband.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; said Anna&rsquo;s friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        But not only those ladies, almost everyone in the room, even the
        Princess Myakaya and Betsy herself, looked several times in the
        direction of the two who had withdrawn from the general circle, as
        though that were a disturbing fact. Alexey Alexandrovitch was the only
        person who did not once look in that direction, and was not diverted
        from the interesting discussion he had entered upon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Noticing the disagreeable impression that was being made on everyone,
        Princess Betsy slipped someone else into her place to listen to Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, and went up to Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always amazed at the clearness and precision of your
        husband&rsquo;s language,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The most
        transcendental ideas seem to be within my grasp when he&rsquo;s
        speaking.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Anna, radiant with a smile of happiness, and
        not understanding a word of what Betsy had said. She crossed over to the
        big table and took part in the general conversation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch, after staying half an hour, went up to his wife
        and suggested that they should go home together. But she answered, not
        looking at him, that she was staying to supper. Alexey Alexandrovitch
        made his bows and withdrew.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fat old Tatar, Madame Karenina&rsquo;s coachman, was with difficulty
        holding one of her pair of grays, chilled with the cold and rearing at
        the entrance. A footman stood opening the carriage door. The hall-porter
        stood holding open the great door of the house. Anna Arkadyevna, with
        her quick little hand, was unfastening the lace of her sleeve, caught in
        the hook of her fur cloak, and with bent head listening to the words
        Vronsky murmured as he escorted her down.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said nothing, of course, and I ask nothing,&rdquo;
        he was saying; &ldquo;but you know that friendship&rsquo;s not what I
        want: that there&rsquo;s only one happiness in life for me, that word
        that you dislike so ... yes, love!...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Love,&rdquo; she repeated slowly, in an inner voice, and
        suddenly, at the very instant she unhooked the lace, she added,
        &ldquo;Why I don&rsquo;t like the word is that it means too much to me,
        far more than you can understand,&rdquo; and she glanced into his face.
        &ldquo;<i>Au revoir!</i>&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She gave him her hand, and with her rapid, springy step she passed by
        the porter and vanished into the carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her glance, the touch of her hand, set him aflame. He kissed the palm of
        his hand where she had touched it, and went home, happy in the sense
        that he had got nearer to the attainment of his aims that evening than
        during the last two months.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 8</h3>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch had seen nothing striking or improper in the fact
        that his wife was sitting with Vronsky at a table apart, in eager
        conversation with him about something. But he noticed that to the rest
        of the party this appeared something striking and improper, and for that
        reason it seemed to him too to be improper. He made up his mind that he
        must speak of it to his wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        On reaching home Alexey Alexandrovitch went to his study, as he usually
        did, seated himself in his low chair, opened a book on the Papacy at the
        place where he had laid the paper-knife in it, and read till one
        o&rsquo;clock, just as he usually did. But from time to time he rubbed
        his high forehead and shook his head, as though to drive away something.
        At his usual time he got up and made his toilet for the night. Anna
        Arkadyevna had not yet come in. With a book under his arm he went
        upstairs. But this evening, instead of his usual thoughts and
        meditations upon official details, his thoughts were absorbed by his
        wife and something disagreeable connected with her. Contrary to his
        usual habit, he did not get into bed, but fell to walking up and down
        the rooms with his hands clasped behind his back. He could not go to
        bed, feeling that it was absolutely needful for him first to think
        thoroughly over the position that had just arisen.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Alexey Alexandrovitch had made up his mind that he must talk to his
        wife about it, it had seemed a very easy and simple matter. But now,
        when he began to think over the question that had just presented itself,
        it seemed to him very complicated and difficult.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch was not jealous. Jealousy according to his notions
        was an insult to one&rsquo;s wife, and one ought to have confidence in
        one&rsquo;s wife. Why one ought to have confidence&mdash;that is to say,
        complete conviction that his young wife would always love him&mdash;he
        did not ask himself. But he had no experience of lack of confidence,
        because he had confidence in her, and told himself that he ought to have
        it. Now, though his conviction that jealousy was a shameful feeling and
        that one ought to feel confidence, had not broken down, he felt that he
        was standing face to face with something illogical and irrational, and
        did not know what was to be done. Alexey Alexandrovitch was standing
        face to face with life, with the possibility of his wife&rsquo;s loving
        someone other than himself, and this seemed to him very irrational and
        incomprehensible because it was life itself. All his life Alexey
        Alexandrovitch had lived and worked in official spheres, having to do
        with the reflection of life. And every time he had stumbled against life
        itself he had shrunk away from it. Now he experienced a feeling akin to
        that of a man who, while calmly crossing a precipice by a bridge, should
        suddenly discover that the bridge is broken, and that there is a chasm
        below. That chasm was life itself, the bridge that artificial life in
        which Alexey Alexandrovitch had lived. For the first time the question
        presented itself to him of the possibility of his wife&rsquo;s loving
        someone else, and he was horrified at it.
      </p>

      <p>
        He did not undress, but walked up and down with his regular tread over
        the resounding parquet of the dining-room, where one lamp was burning,
        over the carpet of the dark drawing-room, in which the light was
        reflected on the big new portrait of himself hanging over the sofa, and
        across her boudoir, where two candles burned, lighting up the portraits
        of her parents and woman friends, and the pretty knick-knacks of her
        writing-table, that he knew so well. He walked across her boudoir to the
        bedroom door, and turned back again. At each turn in his walk,
        especially at the parquet of the lighted dining-room, he halted and said
        to himself, &ldquo;Yes, this I must decide and put a stop to; I must
        express my view of it and my decision.&rdquo; And he turned back again.
        &ldquo;But express what&mdash;what decision?&rdquo; he said to himself
        in the drawing-room, and he found no reply. &ldquo;But after all,&rdquo;
        he asked himself before turning into the boudoir, &ldquo;what has
        occurred? Nothing. She was talking a long while with him. But what of
        that? Surely women in society can talk to whom they please. And then,
        jealousy means lowering both myself and her,&rdquo; he told himself as
        he went into her boudoir; but this dictum, which had always had such
        weight with him before, had now no weight and no meaning at all. And
        from the bedroom door he turned back again; but as he entered the dark
        drawing-room some inner voice told him that it was not so, and that if
        others noticed it that showed that there was something. And he said to
        himself again in the dining-room, &ldquo;Yes, I must decide and put a
        stop to it, and express my view of it....&rdquo; And again at the turn
        in the drawing-room he asked himself, &ldquo;Decide how?&rdquo; And
        again he asked himself, &ldquo;What had occurred?&rdquo; and answered,
        &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; and recollected that jealousy was a feeling
        insulting to his wife; but again in the drawing-room he was convinced
        that something had happened. His thoughts, like his body, went round a
        complete circle, without coming upon anything new. He noticed this,
        rubbed his forehead, and sat down in her boudoir.
      </p>

      <p>
        There, looking at her table, with the malachite blotting case lying at
        the top and an unfinished letter, his thoughts suddenly changed. He
        began to think of her, of what she was thinking and feeling. For the
        first time he pictured vividly to himself her personal life, her ideas,
        her desires, and the idea that she could and should have a separate life
        of her own seemed to him so alarming that he made haste to dispel it. It
        was the chasm which he was afraid to peep into. To put himself in
        thought and feeling in another person&rsquo;s place was a spiritual
        exercise not natural to Alexey Alexandrovitch. He looked on this
        spiritual exercise as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And the worst of it all,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;is that just
        now, at the very moment when my great work is approaching
        completion&rdquo; (he was thinking of the project he was bringing
        forward at the time), &ldquo;when I stand in need of all my mental peace
        and all my energies, just now this stupid worry should fall foul of me.
        But what&rsquo;s to be done? I&rsquo;m not one of those men who submit
        to uneasiness and worry without having the force of character to face
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I must think it over, come to a decision, and put it out of my
        mind,&rdquo; he said aloud.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The question of her feelings, of what has passed and may be
        passing in her soul, that&rsquo;s not my affair; that&rsquo;s the affair
        of her conscience, and falls under the head of religion,&rdquo; he said
        to himself, feeling consolation in the sense that he had found to which
        division of regulating principles this new circumstance could be
        properly referred.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself,
        &ldquo;questions as to her feelings, and so on, are questions for her
        conscience, with which I can have nothing to do. My duty is clearly
        defined. As the head of the family, I am a person bound in duty to guide
        her, and consequently, in part the person responsible; I am bound to
        point out the danger I perceive, to warn her, even to use my authority.
        I ought to speak plainly to her.&rdquo; And everything that he would say
        tonight to his wife took clear shape in Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s
        head. Thinking over what he would say, he somewhat regretted that he
        should have to use his time and mental powers for domestic consumption,
        with so little to show for it, but, in spite of that, the form and
        contents of the speech before him shaped itself as clearly and
        distinctly in his head as a ministerial report.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I must say and express fully the following points: first,
        exposition of the value to be attached to public opinion and to decorum;
        secondly, exposition of religious significance of marriage; thirdly, if
        need be, reference to the calamity possibly ensuing to our son;
        fourthly, reference to the unhappiness likely to result to
        herself.&rdquo; And, interlacing his fingers, Alexey Alexandrovitch
        stretched them, and the joints of the fingers cracked. This trick, a bad
        habit, the cracking of his fingers, always soothed him, and gave
        precision to his thoughts, so needful to him at this juncture.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was the sound of a carriage driving up to the front door. Alexey
        Alexandrovitch halted in the middle of the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        A woman&rsquo;s step was heard mounting the stairs. Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, ready for his speech, stood compressing his crossed
        fingers, waiting to see if the crack would not come again. One joint
        cracked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Already, from the sound of light steps on the stairs, he was aware that
        she was close, and though he was satisfied with his speech, he felt
        frightened of the explanation confronting him....
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 9</h3>

      <p>
        Anna came in with hanging head, playing with the tassels of her hood.
        Her face was brilliant and glowing; but this glow was not one of
        brightness; it suggested the fearful glow of a conflagration in the
        midst of a dark night. On seeing her husband, Anna raised her head and
        smiled, as though she had just waked up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not in bed? What a wonder!&rdquo; she said, letting
        fall her hood, and without stopping, she went on into the dressing-room.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s late, Alexey Alexandrovitch,&rdquo; she said, when she
        had gone through the doorway.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna, it&rsquo;s necessary for me to have a talk with you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;With me?&rdquo; she said, wonderingly. She came out from behind
        the door of the dressing-room, and looked at him. &ldquo;Why, what is
        it? What about?&rdquo; she asked, sitting down. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s
        talk, if it&rsquo;s so necessary. But it would be better to get to
        sleep.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna said what came to her lips, and marveled, hearing herself, at her
        own capacity for lying. How simple and natural were her words, and how
        likely that she was simply sleepy! She felt herself clad in an
        impenetrable armor of falsehood. She felt that some unseen force had
        come to her aid and was supporting her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna, I must warn you,&rdquo; he began.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Warn me?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She looked at him so simply, so brightly, that anyone who did not know
        her as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural,
        either in the sound or the sense of her words. But to him, knowing her,
        knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual, she
        noticed it, and asked him the reason; to him, knowing that every joy,
        every pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once;
        to him, now to see that she did not care to notice his state of mind,
        that she did not care to say a word about herself, meant a great deal.
        He saw that the inmost recesses of her soul, that had always hitherto
        lain open before him, were closed against him. More than that, he saw
        from her tone that she was not even perturbed at that, but as it were
        said straight out to him: &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s shut up, and so it must
        be, and will be in future.&rdquo; Now he experienced a feeling such as a
        man might have, returning home and finding his own house locked up.
        &ldquo;But perhaps the key may yet be found,&rdquo; thought Alexey
        Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I want to warn you,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, &ldquo;that
        through thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be
        talked about in society. Your too animated conversation this evening
        with Count Vronsky&rdquo; (he enunciated the name firmly and with
        deliberate emphasis) &ldquo;attracted attention.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He talked and looked at her laughing eyes, which frightened him now with
        their impenetrable look, and, as he talked, he felt all the uselessness
        and idleness of his words.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always like that,&rdquo; she answered, as though
        completely misapprehending him, and of all he had said only taking in
        the last phrase. &ldquo;One time you don&rsquo;t like my being dull, and
        another time you don&rsquo;t like my being lively. I wasn&rsquo;t dull.
        Does that offend you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch shivered, and bent his hands to make the joints
        crack.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, please, don&rsquo;t do that, I do so dislike it,&rdquo; she
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna, is this you?&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch, quietly
        making an effort over himself, and restraining the motion of his
        fingers.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what is it all about?&rdquo; she said, with such genuine and
        droll wonder. &ldquo;What do you want of me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch paused, and rubbed his forehead and his eyes. He
        saw that instead of doing as he had intended&mdash;that is to say,
        warning his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world&mdash;he had
        unconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her
        conscience, and was struggling against the barrier he fancied between
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This is what I meant to say to you,&rdquo; he went on coldly and
        composedly, &ldquo;and I beg you to listen to it. I consider jealousy,
        as you know, a humiliating and degrading feeling, and I shall never
        allow myself to be influenced by it; but there are certain rules of
        decorum which cannot be disregarded with impunity. This evening it was
        not I observed it, but judging by the impression made on the company,
        everyone observed that your conduct and deportment were not altogether
        what could be desired.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I positively don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Anna, shrugging
        her shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she thought.
        &ldquo;But other people noticed it, and that&rsquo;s what upsets
        him.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not well, Alexey
        Alexandrovitch,&rdquo; she added, and she got up, and would have gone
        towards the door; but he moved forward as though he would stop her.
      </p>

      <p>
        His face was ugly and forbidding, as Anna had never seen him. She
        stopped, and bending her head back and on one side, began with her rapid
        hand taking out her hairpins.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m listening to what&rsquo;s to come,&rdquo; she
        said, calmly and ironically; &ldquo;and indeed I listen with interest,
        for I should like to understand what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She spoke, and marveled at the confident, calm, and natural tone in
        which she was speaking, and the choice of the words she used.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To enter into all the details of your feelings I have no right,
        and besides, I regard that as useless and even harmful,&rdquo; began
        Alexey Alexandrovitch. &ldquo;Ferreting in one&rsquo;s soul, one often
        ferrets out something that might have lain there unnoticed. Your
        feelings are an affair of your own conscience; but I am in duty bound to
        you, to myself, and to God, to point out to you your duties. Our life
        has been joined, not by man, but by God. That union can only be severed
        by a crime, and a crime of that nature brings its own
        chastisement.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand a word. And, oh dear! how sleepy I am,
        unluckily,&rdquo; she said, rapidly passing her hand through her hair,
        feeling for the remaining hairpins.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna, for God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t speak like that!&rdquo; he
        said gently. &ldquo;Perhaps I am mistaken, but believe me, what I say, I
        say as much for myself as for you. I am your husband, and I love
        you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        For an instant her face fell, and the mocking gleam in her eyes died
        away; but the word <i>love</i> threw her into revolt again. She thought:
        &ldquo;Love? Can he love? If he hadn&rsquo;t heard there was such a
        thing as love, he would never have used the word. He doesn&rsquo;t even
        know what love is.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey Alexandrovitch, really I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo;
        she said. &ldquo;Define what it is you find....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Pardon, let me say all I have to say. I love you. But I am not
        speaking of myself; the most important persons in this matter are our
        son and yourself. It may very well be, I repeat, that my words seem to
        you utterly unnecessary and out of place; it may be that they are called
        forth by my mistaken impression. In that case, I beg you to forgive me.
        But if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest foundation for
        them, then I beg you to think a little, and if your heart prompts you,
        to speak out to me....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch was unconsciously saying something utterly unlike
        what he had prepared.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have nothing to say. And besides,&rdquo; she said hurriedly,
        with difficulty repressing a smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really time to be
        in bed.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed, and, without saying more, went into the
        bedroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she came into the bedroom, he was already in bed. His lips were
        sternly compressed, and his eyes looked away from her. Anna got into her
        bed, and lay expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to her
        again. She both feared his speaking and wished for it. But he was
        silent. She waited for a long while without moving, and had forgotten
        about him. She thought of that other; she pictured him, and felt how her
        heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of him.
        Suddenly she heard an even, tranquil snore. For the first instant Alexey
        Alexandrovitch seemed, as it were, appalled at his own snoring, and
        ceased; but after an interval of two breathings the snore sounded again,
        with a new tranquil rhythm.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s late, it&rsquo;s late,&rdquo; she whispered with a
        smile. A long while she lay, not moving, with open eyes, whose
        brilliance she almost fancied she could herself see in the darkness.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 10</h3>

      <p>
        From that time a new life began for Alexey Alexandrovitch and for his
        wife. Nothing special happened. Anna went out into society, as she had
        always done, was particularly often at Princess Betsy&rsquo;s, and met
        Vronsky everywhere. Alexey Alexandrovitch saw this, but could do
        nothing. All his efforts to draw her into open discussion she confronted
        with a barrier which he could not penetrate, made up of a sort of amused
        perplexity. Outwardly everything was the same, but their inner relations
        were completely changed. Alexey Alexandrovitch, a man of great power in
        the world of politics, felt himself helpless in this. Like an ox with
        head bent, submissively he awaited the blow which he felt was lifted
        over him. Every time he began to think about it, he felt that he must
        try once more, that by kindness, tenderness, and persuasion there was
        still hope of saving her, of bringing her back to herself, and every day
        he made ready to talk to her. But every time he began talking to her, he
        felt that the spirit of evil and deceit, which had taken possession of
        her, had possession of him too, and he talked to her in a tone quite
        unlike that in which he had meant to talk. Involuntarily he talked to
        her in his habitual tone of jeering at anyone who should say what he was
        saying. And in that tone it was impossible to say what needed to be said
        to her.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 11</h3>

      <p>
        That which for Vronsky had been almost a whole year the one absorbing
        desire of his life, replacing all his old desires; that which for Anna
        had been an impossible, terrible, and even for that reason more
        entrancing dream of bliss, that desire had been fulfilled. He stood
        before her, pale, his lower jaw quivering, and besought her to be calm,
        not knowing how or why.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna! Anna!&rdquo; he said with a choking voice, &ldquo;Anna, for
        pity&rsquo;s sake!...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But the louder he spoke, the lower she dropped her once proud and gay,
        now shame-stricken head, and she bowed down and sank from the sofa where
        she was sitting, down on the floor, at his feet; she would have fallen
        on the carpet if he had not held her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My God! Forgive me!&rdquo; she said, sobbing, pressing his hands
        to her bosom.
      </p>

      <p>
        She felt so sinful, so guilty, that nothing was left her but to
        humiliate herself and beg forgiveness; and as now there was no one in
        her life but him, to him she addressed her prayer for forgiveness.
        Looking at him, she had a physical sense of her humiliation, and she
        could say nothing more. He felt what a murderer must feel, when he sees
        the body he has robbed of life. That body, robbed by him of life, was
        their love, the first stage of their love. There was something awful and
        revolting in the memory of what had been bought at this fearful price of
        shame. Shame at their spiritual nakedness crushed her and infected him.
        But in spite of all the murderer&rsquo;s horror before the body of his
        victim, he must hack it to pieces, hide the body, must use what he has
        gained by his murder.
      </p>

      <p>
        And with fury, as it were with passion, the murderer falls on the body,
        and drags it and hacks at it; so he covered her face and shoulders with
        kisses. She held his hand, and did not stir. &ldquo;Yes, these
        kisses&mdash;that is what has been bought by this shame. Yes, and one
        hand, which will always be mine&mdash;the hand of my accomplice.&rdquo;
        She lifted up that hand and kissed it. He sank on his knees and tried to
        see her face; but she hid it, and said nothing. At last, as though
        making an effort over herself, she got up and pushed him away. Her face
        was still as beautiful, but it was only the more pitiful for that.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All is over,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I have nothing but you.
        Remember that.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can never forget what is my whole life. For one instant of this
        happiness....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Happiness!&rdquo; she said with horror and loathing and her
        horror unconsciously infected him. &ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake, not a
        word, not a word more.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She rose quickly and moved away from him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not a word more,&rdquo; she repeated, and with a look of chill
        despair, incomprehensible to him, she parted from him. She felt that at
        that moment she could not put into words the sense of shame, of rapture,
        and of horror at this stepping into a new life, and she did not want to
        speak of it, to vulgarize this feeling by inappropriate words. But later
        too, and the next day and the third day, she still found no words in
        which she could express the complexity of her feelings; indeed, she
        could not even find thoughts in which she could clearly think out all
        that was in her soul.
      </p>

      <p>
        She said to herself: &ldquo;No, just now I can&rsquo;t think of it,
        later on, when I am calmer.&rdquo; But this calm for thought never came;
        every time the thought rose of what she had done and what would happen
        to her, and what she ought to do, a horror came over her and she drove
        those thoughts away.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Later, later,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;when I am
        calmer.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But in dreams, when she had no control over her thoughts, her position
        presented itself to her in all its hideous nakedness. One dream haunted
        her almost every night. She dreamed that both were her husbands at once,
        that both were lavishing caresses on her. Alexey Alexandrovitch was
        weeping, kissing her hands, and saying, &ldquo;How happy we are
        now!&rdquo; And Alexey Vronsky was there too, and he too was her
        husband. And she was marveling that it had once seemed impossible to
        her, was explaining to them, laughing, that this was ever so much
        simpler, and that now both of them were happy and contented. But this
        dream weighed on her like a nightmare, and she awoke from it in terror.

      <h3>Chapter 12</h3>

      <p>
        In the early days after his return from Moscow, whenever Levin shuddered
        and grew red, remembering the disgrace of his rejection, he said to
        himself: &ldquo;This was just how I used to shudder and blush, thinking
        myself utterly lost, when I was plucked in physics and did not get my
        remove; and how I thought myself utterly ruined after I had mismanaged
        that affair of my sister&rsquo;s that was entrusted to me. And yet, now
        that years have passed, I recall it and wonder that it could distress me
        so much. It will be the same thing too with this trouble. Time will go
        by and I shall not mind about this either.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But three months had passed and he had not left off minding about it;
        and it was as painful for him to think of it as it had been those first
        days. He could not be at peace because after dreaming so long of family
        life, and feeling himself so ripe for it, he was still not married, and
        was further than ever from marriage. He was painfully conscious himself,
        as were all about him, that at his years it is not well for man to be
        alone. He remembered how before starting for Moscow he had once said to
        his cowman Nikolay, a simple-hearted peasant, whom he liked talking to:
        &ldquo;Well, Nikolay! I mean to get married,&rdquo; and how Nikolay had
        promptly answered, as of a matter on which there could be no possible
        doubt: &ldquo;And high time too, Konstantin Dmitrievitch.&rdquo; But
        marriage had now become further off than ever. The place was taken, and
        whenever he tried to imagine any of the girls he knew in that place, he
        felt that it was utterly impossible. Moreover, the recollection of the
        rejection and the part he had played in the affair tortured him with
        shame. However often he told himself that he was in no wise to blame in
        it, that recollection, like other humiliating reminiscences of a similar
        kind, made him twinge and blush. There had been in his past, as in every
        man&rsquo;s, actions, recognized by him as bad, for which his conscience
        ought to have tormented him; but the memory of these evil actions was
        far from causing him so much suffering as those trivial but humiliating
        reminiscences. These wounds never healed. And with these memories was
        now ranged his rejection and the pitiful position in which he must have
        appeared to others that evening. But time and work did their part.
        Bitter memories were more and more covered up by the
        incidents&mdash;paltry in his eyes, but really important&mdash;of his
        country life. Every week he thought less often of Kitty. He was
        impatiently looking forward to the news that she was married, or just
        going to be married, hoping that such news would, like having a tooth
        out, completely cure him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile spring came on, beautiful and kindly, without the delays and
        treacheries of spring,&mdash;one of those rare springs in which plants,
        beasts, and man rejoice alike. This lovely spring roused Levin still
        more, and strengthened him in his resolution of renouncing all his past
        and building up his lonely life firmly and independently. Though many of
        the plans with which he had returned to the country had not been carried
        out, still his most important resolution&mdash;that of purity&mdash;had
        been kept by him. He was free from that shame, which had usually
        harassed him after a fall; and he could look everyone straight in the
        face. In February he had received a letter from Marya Nikolaevna telling
        him that his brother Nikolay&rsquo;s health was getting worse, but that
        he would not take advice, and in consequence of this letter Levin went
        to Moscow to his brother&rsquo;s and succeeded in persuading him to see
        a doctor and to go to a watering-place abroad. He succeeded so well in
        persuading his brother, and in lending him money for the journey without
        irritating him, that he was satisfied with himself in that matter. In
        addition to his farming, which called for special attention in spring,
        and in addition to reading, Levin had begun that winter a work on
        agriculture, the plan of which turned on taking into account the
        character of the laborer on the land as one of the unalterable data of
        the question, like the climate and the soil, and consequently deducing
        all the principles of scientific culture, not simply from the data of
        soil and climate, but from the data of soil, climate, and a certain
        unalterable character of the laborer. Thus, in spite of his solitude, or
        in consequence of his solitude, his life was exceedingly full. Only
        rarely he suffered from an unsatisfied desire to communicate his stray
        ideas to someone besides Agafea Mihalovna. With her indeed he not
        infrequently fell into discussion upon physics, the theory of
        agriculture, and especially philosophy; philosophy was Agafea
        Mihalovna&rsquo;s favorite subject.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spring was slow in unfolding. For the last few weeks it had been
        steadily fine frosty weather. In the daytime it thawed in the sun, but
        at night there were even seven degrees of frost. There was such a frozen
        surface on the snow that they drove the wagons anywhere off the roads.
        Easter came in the snow. Then all of a sudden, on Easter Monday, a warm
        wind sprang up, storm clouds swooped down, and for three days and three
        nights the warm, driving rain fell in streams. On Thursday the wind
        dropped, and a thick gray fog brooded over the land as though hiding the
        mysteries of the transformations that were being wrought in nature.
        Behind the fog there was the flowing of water, the cracking and floating
        of ice, the swift rush of turbid, foaming torrents; and on the following
        Monday, in the evening, the fog parted, the storm clouds split up into
        little curling crests of cloud, the sky cleared, and the real spring had
        come. In the morning the sun rose brilliant and quickly wore away the
        thin layer of ice that covered the water, and all the warm air was
        quivering with the steam that rose up from the quickened earth. The old
        grass looked greener, and the young grass thrust up its tiny blades; the
        buds of the guelder-rose and of the currant and the sticky birch-buds
        were swollen with sap, and an exploring bee was humming about the golden
        blossoms that studded the willow. Larks trilled unseen above the velvety
        green fields and the ice-covered stubble-land; peewits wailed over the
        low lands and marshes flooded by the pools; cranes and wild geese flew
        high across the sky uttering their spring calls. The cattle, bald in
        patches where the new hair had not grown yet, lowed in the pastures; the
        bowlegged lambs frisked round their bleating mothers. Nimble children
        ran about the drying paths, covered with the prints of bare feet. There
        was a merry chatter of peasant women over their linen at the pond, and
        the ring of axes in the yard, where the peasants were repairing ploughs
        and harrows. The real spring had come.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 13</h3>

      <p>
        Levin put on his big boots, and, for the first time, a cloth jacket,
        instead of his fur cloak, and went out to look after his farm, stepping
        over streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his eyes,
        and treading one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spring is the time of plans and projects. And, as he came out into the
        farmyard, Levin, like a tree in spring that knows not what form will be
        taken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds,
        hardly knew what undertakings he was going to begin upon now in the farm
        work that was so dear to him. But he felt that he was full of the most
        splendid plans and projects. First of all he went to the cattle. The
        cows had been let out into their paddock, and their smooth sides were
        already shining with their new, sleek, spring coats; they basked in the
        sunshine and lowed to go to the meadow. Levin gazed admiringly at the
        cows he knew so intimately to the minutest detail of their condition,
        and gave orders for them to be driven out into the meadow, and the
        calves to be let into the paddock. The herdsman ran gaily to get ready
        for the meadow. The cowherd girls, picking up their petticoats, ran
        splashing through the mud with bare legs, still white, not yet brown
        from the sun, waving brush wood in their hands, chasing the calves that
        frolicked in the mirth of spring.
      </p>

      <p>
        After admiring the young ones of that year, who were particularly
        fine&mdash;the early calves were the size of a peasant&rsquo;s cow, and
        Pava&rsquo;s daughter, at three months old, was as big as a
        yearling&mdash;Levin gave orders for a trough to be brought out and for
        them to be fed in the paddock. But it appeared that as the paddock had
        not been used during the winter, the hurdles made in the autumn for it
        were broken. He sent for the carpenter, who, according to his orders,
        ought to have been at work at the thrashing machine. But it appeared
        that the carpenter was repairing the harrows, which ought to have been
        repaired before Lent. This was very annoying to Levin. It was annoying
        to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the farm work against
        which he had been striving with all his might for so many years. The
        hurdles, as he ascertained, being not wanted in winter, had been carried
        to the cart-horses&rsquo; stable; and there broken, as they were of
        light construction, only meant for feeding calves. Moreover, it was
        apparent also that the harrows and all the agricultural implements,
        which he had directed to be looked over and repaired in the winter, for
        which very purpose he had hired three carpenters, had not been put into
        repair, and the harrows were being repaired when they ought to have been
        harrowing the field. Levin sent for his bailiff, but immediately went
        off himself to look for him. The bailiff, beaming all over, like
        everyone that day, in a sheepskin bordered with astrachan, came out of
        the barn, twisting a bit of straw in his hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t the carpenter at the thrashing machine?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I meant to tell you yesterday, the harrows want repairing.
        Here it&rsquo;s time they got to work in the fields.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what were they doing in the winter, then?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what did you want the carpenter for?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where are the hurdles for the calves&rsquo; paddock?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I ordered them to be got ready. What would you have with those
        peasants!&rdquo; said the bailiff, with a wave of his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not those peasants but this bailiff!&rdquo; said
        Levin, getting angry. &ldquo;Why, what do I keep you for?&rdquo; he
        cried. But, bethinking himself that this would not help matters, he
        stopped short in the middle of a sentence, and merely sighed.
        &ldquo;Well, what do you say? Can sowing begin?&rdquo; he asked, after a
        pause.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Behind Turkin tomorrow or the next day they might begin.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And the clover?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent Vassily and Mishka; they&rsquo;re sowing. Only I
        don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;ll manage to get through; it&rsquo;s so
        slushy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How many acres?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;About fifteen.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why not sow all?&rdquo; cried Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        That they were only sowing the clover on fifteen acres, not on all the
        forty-five, was still more annoying to him. Clover, as he knew, both
        from books and from his own experience, never did well except when it
        was sown as early as possible, almost in the snow. And yet Levin could
        never get this done.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one to send. What would you have with such a set
        of peasants? Three haven&rsquo;t turned up. And there&rsquo;s
        Semyon....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you should have taken some men from the thatching.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And so I have, as it is.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where are the peasants, then?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Five are making compôte&rdquo; (which meant compost), &ldquo;four
        are shifting the oats for fear of a touch of mildew, Konstantin
        Dmitrievitch.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin knew very well that &ldquo;a touch of mildew&rdquo; meant that his
        English seed oats were already ruined. Again they had not done as he had
        ordered.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, but I told you during Lent to put in pipes,&rdquo; he cried.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put yourself out; we shall get it all done in
        time.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin waved his hand angrily, went into the granary to glance at the
        oats, and then to the stable. The oats were not yet spoiled. But the
        peasants were carrying the oats in spades when they might simply let
        them slide down into the lower granary; and arranging for this to be
        done, and taking two workmen from there for sowing clover, Levin got
        over his vexation with the bailiff. Indeed, it was such a lovely day
        that one could not be angry.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ignat!&rdquo; he called to the coachman, who, with his sleeves
        tucked up, was washing the carriage wheels, &ldquo;saddle me....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Which, sir?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, let it be Kolpik.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        While they were saddling his horse, Levin again called up the bailiff,
        who was hanging about in sight, to make it up with him, and began
        talking to him about the spring operations before them, and his plans
        for the farm.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wagons were to begin carting manure earlier, so as to get all done
        before the early mowing. And the ploughing of the further land to go on
        without a break so as to let it ripen lying fallow. And the mowing to be
        all done by hired labor, not on half-profits. The bailiff listened
        attentively, and obviously made an effort to approve of his
        employer&rsquo;s projects. But still he had that look Levin knew so well
        that always irritated him, a look of hopelessness and despondency. That
        look said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well, but as God wills.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Nothing mortified Levin so much as that tone. But it was the tone common
        to all the bailiffs he had ever had. They had all taken up that attitude
        to his plans, and so now he was not angered by it, but mortified, and
        felt all the more roused to struggle against this, as it seemed,
        elemental force continually ranged against him, for which he could find
        no other expression than &ldquo;as God wills.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If we can manage it, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,&rdquo; said the
        bailiff.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why ever shouldn&rsquo;t you manage it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We positively must have another fifteen laborers. And they
        don&rsquo;t turn up. There were some here today asking seventy roubles
        for the summer.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin was silent. Again he was brought face to face with that opposing
        force. He knew that however much they tried, they could not hire more
        than forty&mdash;thirty-seven perhaps or thirty-eight&mdash;laborers for
        a reasonable sum. Some forty had been taken on, and there were no more.
        But still he could not help struggling against it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Send to Sury, to Tchefirovka; if they don&rsquo;t come we must
        look for them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll send, to be sure,&rdquo; said Vassily Fedorovitch
        despondently. &ldquo;But there are the horses, too, they&rsquo;re not
        good for much.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get some more. I know, of course,&rdquo; Levin added
        laughing, &ldquo;you always want to do with as little and as poor
        quality as possible; but this year I&rsquo;m not going to let you have
        things your own way. I&rsquo;ll see to everything myself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t think you take much rest as it is. It cheers
        us up to work under the master&rsquo;s eye....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So they&rsquo;re sowing clover behind the Birch Dale? I&rsquo;ll
        go and have a look at them,&rdquo; he said, getting on to the little bay
        cob, Kolpik, who was led up by the coachman.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get across the streams, Konstantin
        Dmitrievitch,&rdquo; the coachman shouted.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll go by the forest.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out
        into the open country, his good little horse, after his long inactivity,
        stepping out gallantly, snorting over the pools, and asking, as it were,
        for guidance. If Levin had felt happy before in the cattle pens and
        farmyard, he felt happier yet in the open country. Swaying rhythmically
        with the ambling paces of his good little cob, drinking in the warm yet
        fresh scent of the snow and the air, as he rode through his forest over
        the crumbling, wasted snow, still left in parts, and covered with
        dissolving tracks, he rejoiced over every tree, with the moss reviving
        on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots. When he came out of the
        forest, in the immense plain before him, his grass fields stretched in
        an unbroken carpet of green, without one bare place or swamp, only
        spotted here and there in the hollows with patches of melting snow. He
        was not put out of temper even by the sight of the peasants&rsquo;
        horses and colts trampling down his young grass (he told a peasant he
        met to drive them out), nor by the sarcastic and stupid reply of the
        peasant Ipat, whom he met on the way, and asked, &ldquo;Well, Ipat,
        shall we soon be sowing?&rdquo; &ldquo;We must get the ploughing done
        first, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,&rdquo; answered Ipat. The further he
        rode, the happier he became, and plans for the land rose to his mind
        each better than the last; to plant all his fields with hedges along the
        southern borders, so that the snow should not lie under them; to divide
        them up into six fields of arable and three of pasture and hay; to build
        a cattle yard at the further end of the estate, and to dig a pond and to
        construct movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land.
        And then eight hundred acres of wheat, three hundred of potatoes, and
        four hundred of clover, and not one acre exhausted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Absorbed in such dreams, carefully keeping his horse by the hedges, so
        as not to trample his young crops, he rode up to the laborers who had
        been sent to sow clover. A cart with the seed in it was standing, not at
        the edge, but in the middle of the crop, and the winter corn had been
        torn up by the wheels and trampled by the horse. Both the laborers were
        sitting in the hedge, probably smoking a pipe together. The earth in the
        cart, with which the seed was mixed, was not crushed to powder, but
        crusted together or adhering in clods. Seeing the master, the laborer,
        Vassily, went towards the cart, while Mishka set to work sowing. This
        was not as it should be, but with the laborers Levin seldom lost his
        temper. When Vassily came up, Levin told him to lead the horse to the
        hedge.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, sir, it&rsquo;ll spring up again,&rdquo;
        responded Vassily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t argue,&rdquo; said Levin, &ldquo;but do as
        you&rsquo;re told.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Vassily, and he took the horse&rsquo;s
        head. &ldquo;What a sowing, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,&rdquo; he said,
        hesitating; &ldquo;first rate. Only it&rsquo;s a work to get about! You
        drag a ton of earth on your shoes.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why is it you have earth that&rsquo;s not sifted?&rdquo; said
        Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, we crumble it up,&rdquo; answered Vassily, taking up some
        seed and rolling the earth in his palms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vassily was not to blame for their having filled up his cart with
        unsifted earth, but still it was annoying.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin had more than once already tried a way he knew for stifling his
        anger, and turning all that seemed dark right again, and he tried that
        way now. He watched how Mishka strode along, swinging the huge clods of
        earth that clung to each foot; and getting off his horse, he took the
        sieve from Vassily and started sowing himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where did you stop?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vassily pointed to the mark with his foot, and Levin went forward as
        best he could, scattering the seed on the land. Walking was as difficult
        as on a bog, and by the time Levin had ended the row he was in a great
        heat, and he stopped and gave up the sieve to Vassily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, master, when summer&rsquo;s here, mind you don&rsquo;t
        scold me for these rows,&rdquo; said Vassily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Levin cheerily, already feeling the effect of his
        method.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ll see in the summer time. It&rsquo;ll look
        different. Look you where I sowed last spring. How I did work at it! I
        do my best, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, d&rsquo;ye see, as I would for my
        own father. I don&rsquo;t like bad work myself, nor would I let another
        man do it. What&rsquo;s good for the master&rsquo;s good for us too. To
        look out yonder now,&rdquo; said Vassily, pointing, &ldquo;it does
        one&rsquo;s heart good.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely spring, Vassily.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a spring such as the old men don&rsquo;t remember
        the like of. I was up home; an old man up there has sown wheat too,
        about an acre of it. He was saying you wouldn&rsquo;t know it from
        rye.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you been sowing wheat long?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, sir, it was you taught us the year before last. You gave me
        two measures. We sold about eight bushels and sowed a rood.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, mind you crumble up the clods,&rdquo; said Levin, going
        towards his horse, &ldquo;and keep an eye on Mishka. And if
        there&rsquo;s a good crop you shall have half a rouble for every
        acre.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Humbly thankful. We are very well content, sir, as it is.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin got on his horse and rode towards the field where was last
        year&rsquo;s clover, and the one which was ploughed ready for the spring
        corn.
      </p>

      <p>
        The crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent. It had
        survived everything, and stood up vividly green through the broken
        stalks of last year&rsquo;s wheat. The horse sank in up to the pasterns,
        and he drew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the half-thawed
        ground. Over the ploughland riding was utterly impossible; the horse
        could only keep a foothold where there was ice, and in the thawing
        furrows he sank deep in at each step. The ploughland was in splendid
        condition; in a couple of days it would be fit for harrowing and sowing.
        Everything was capital, everything was cheering. Levin rode back across
        the streams, hoping the water would have gone down. And he did in fact
        get across, and startled two ducks. &ldquo;There must be snipe
        too,&rdquo; he thought, and just as he reached the turning homewards he
        met the forest keeper, who confirmed his theory about the snipe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin went home at a trot, so as to have time to eat his dinner and get
        his gun ready for the evening.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 14</h3>

      <p>
        As he rode up to the house in the happiest frame of mind, Levin heard
        the bell ring at the side of the principal entrance of the house.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s someone from the railway station,&rdquo; he
        thought, &ldquo;just the time to be here from the Moscow train ... Who
        could it be? What if it&rsquo;s brother Nikolay? He did say:
        &lsquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll go to the waters, or maybe I&rsquo;ll come down
        to you.&rsquo;&rdquo; He felt dismayed and vexed for the first minute,
        that his brother Nikolay&rsquo;s presence should come to disturb his
        happy mood of spring. But he felt ashamed of the feeling, and at once he
        opened, as it were, the arms of his soul, and with a softened feeling of
        joy and expectation, now he hoped with all his heart that it was his
        brother. He pricked up his horse, and riding out from behind the acacias
        he saw a hired three-horse sledge from the railway station, and a
        gentleman in a fur coat. It was not his brother. &ldquo;Oh, if it were
        only some nice person one could talk to a little!&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried Levin joyfully, flinging up both his hands.
        &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a delightful visitor! Ah, how glad I am to see
        you!&rdquo; he shouted, recognizing Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall find out for certain whether she&rsquo;s married, or when
        she&rsquo;s going to be married,&rdquo; he thought. And on that
        delicious spring day he felt that the thought of her did not hurt him at
        all.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you didn&rsquo;t expect me, eh?&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, getting out of the sledge, splashed with mud on the bridge
        of his nose, on his cheek, and on his eyebrows, but radiant with health
        and good spirits. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to see you in the first
        place,&rdquo; he said, embracing and kissing him, &ldquo;to have some
        stand-shooting second, and to sell the forest at Ergushovo third.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Delightful! What a spring we&rsquo;re having! How ever did you
        get along in a sledge?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In a cart it would have been worse still, Konstantin
        Dmitrievitch,&rdquo; answered the driver, who knew him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m very, very glad to see you,&rdquo; said Levin,
        with a genuine smile of childlike delight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin led his friend to the room set apart for visitors, where Stepan
        Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s things were carried also&mdash;a bag, a gun in a
        case, a satchel for cigars. Leaving him there to wash and change his
        clothes, Levin went off to the counting house to speak about the
        ploughing and clover. Agafea Mihalovna, always very anxious for the
        credit of the house, met him in the hall with inquiries about dinner.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do just as you like, only let it be as soon as possible,&rdquo;
        he said, and went to the bailiff.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he came back, Stepan Arkadyevitch, washed and combed, came out of
        his room with a beaming smile, and they went upstairs together.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I am glad I managed to get away to you! Now I shall
        understand what the mysterious business is that you are always absorbed
        in here. No, really, I envy you. What a house, how nice it all is! So
        bright, so cheerful!&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgetting that it
        was not always spring and fine weather like that day. &ldquo;And your
        nurse is simply charming! A pretty maid in an apron might be even more
        agreeable, perhaps; but for your severe monastic style it does very
        well.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch told him many interesting pieces of news; especially
        interesting to Levin was the news that his brother, Sergey Ivanovitch,
        was intending to pay him a visit in the summer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not one word did Stepan Arkadyevitch say in reference to Kitty and the
        Shtcherbatskys; he merely gave him greetings from his wife. Levin was
        grateful to him for his delicacy and was very glad of his visitor. As
        always happened with him during his solitude, a mass of ideas and
        feelings had been accumulating within him, which he could not
        communicate to those about him. And now he poured out upon Stepan
        Arkadyevitch his poetic joy in the spring, and his failures and plans
        for the land, and his thoughts and criticisms on the books he had been
        reading, and the idea of his own book, the basis of which really was,
        though he was unaware of it himself, a criticism of all the old books on
        agriculture. Stepan Arkadyevitch, always charming, understanding
        everything at the slightest reference, was particularly charming on this
        visit, and Levin noticed in him a special tenderness, as it were, and a
        new tone of respect that flattered him.
      </p>

      <p>
        The efforts of Agafea Mihalovna and the cook, that the dinner should be
        particularly good, only ended in the two famished friends attacking the
        preliminary course, eating a great deal of bread and butter, salt goose
        and salted mushrooms, and in Levin&rsquo;s finally ordering the soup to
        be served without the accompaniment of little pies, with which the cook
        had particularly meant to impress their visitor. But though Stepan
        Arkadyevitch was accustomed to very different dinners, he thought
        everything excellent: the herb brandy, and the bread, and the butter,
        and above all the salt goose and the mushrooms, and the nettle soup, and
        the chicken in white sauce, and the white Crimean wine&mdash;everything
        was superb and delicious.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Splendid, splendid!&rdquo; he said, lighting a fat cigar after
        the roast. &ldquo;I feel as if, coming to you, I had landed on a
        peaceful shore after the noise and jolting of a steamer. And so you
        maintain that the laborer himself is an element to be studied and to
        regulate the choice of methods in agriculture. Of course, I&rsquo;m an
        ignorant outsider; but I should fancy theory and its application will
        have its influence on the laborer too.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but wait a bit. I&rsquo;m not talking of political economy,
        I&rsquo;m talking of the science of agriculture. It ought to be like the
        natural sciences, and to observe given phenomena and the laborer in his
        economic, ethnographical....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At that instant Agafea Mihalovna came in with jam.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, Agafea Mihalovna,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, kissing
        the tips of his plump fingers, &ldquo;what salt goose, what herb
        brandy!... What do you think, isn&rsquo;t it time to start,
        Kostya?&rdquo; he added.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin looked out of the window at the sun sinking behind the bare
        tree-tops of the forest.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Kouzma, get ready
        the trap,&rdquo; and he ran downstairs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, going down, carefully took the canvas cover off his
        varnished gun case with his own hands, and opening it, began to get
        ready his expensive new-fashioned gun. Kouzma, who already scented a big
        tip, never left Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s side, and put on him both
        his stockings and boots, a task which Stepan Arkadyevitch readily left
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kostya, give orders that if the merchant Ryabinin comes ... I
        told him to come today, he&rsquo;s to be brought in and to wait for
        me....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, do you mean to say you&rsquo;re selling the forest to
        Ryabinin?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes. Do you know him?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To be sure I do. I have had to do business with him,
        &lsquo;positively and conclusively.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed. &ldquo;Positively and conclusively&rdquo;
        were the merchant&rsquo;s favorite words.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s wonderfully funny the way he talks. She knows
        where her master&rsquo;s going!&rdquo; he added, patting Laska, who hung
        about Levin, whining and licking his hands, his boots, and his gun.
      </p>

      <p>
        The trap was already at the steps when they went out.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I told them to bring the trap round; or would you rather
        walk?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;d better drive,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        getting into the trap. He sat down, tucked the tiger-skin rug round him,
        and lighted a cigar. &ldquo;How is it you don&rsquo;t smoke? A cigar is
        a sort of thing, not exactly a pleasure, but the crown and outward sign
        of pleasure. Come, this is life! How splendid it is! This is how I
        should like to live!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, who prevents you?&rdquo; said Levin, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re a lucky man! You&rsquo;ve got everything you
        like. You like horses&mdash;and you have them; dogs&mdash;you have them;
        shooting&mdash;you have it; farming&mdash;you have it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps because I rejoice in what I have, and don&rsquo;t fret
        for what I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Levin, thinking of Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch comprehended, looked at him, but said nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin was grateful to Oblonsky for noticing, with his never-failing
        tact, that he dreaded conversation about the Shtcherbatskys, and so
        saying nothing about them. But now Levin was longing to find out what
        was tormenting him so, yet he had not the courage to begin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, tell me how things are going with you,&rdquo; said Levin,
        bethinking himself that it was not nice of him to think only of himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s eyes sparkled merrily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t admit, I know, that one can be fond of new rolls
        when one has had one&rsquo;s rations of bread&mdash;to your mind
        it&rsquo;s a crime; but I don&rsquo;t count life as life without
        love,&rdquo; he said, taking Levin&rsquo;s question his own way.
        &ldquo;What am I to do? I&rsquo;m made that way. And really, one does so
        little harm to anyone, and gives oneself so much pleasure....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What! is there something new, then?&rdquo; queried Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, my boy, there is! There, do you see, you know the type of
        Ossian&rsquo;s women.... Women, such as one sees in dreams.... Well,
        these women are sometimes to be met in reality ... and these women are
        terrible. Woman, don&rsquo;t you know, is such a subject that however
        much you study it, it&rsquo;s always perfectly new.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, it would be better not to study it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No. Some mathematician has said that enjoyment lies in the search
        for truth, not in the finding it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin listened in silence, and in spite of all the efforts he made, he
        could not in the least enter into the feelings of his friend and
        understand his sentiments and the charm of studying such women.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 15</h3>

      <p>
        The place fixed on for the stand-shooting was not far above a stream in
        a little aspen copse. On reaching the copse, Levin got out of the trap
        and led Oblonsky to a corner of a mossy, swampy glade, already quite
        free from snow. He went back himself to a double birch tree on the other
        side, and leaning his gun on the fork of a dead lower branch, he took
        off his full overcoat, fastened his belt again, and worked his arms to
        see if they were free.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gray old Laska, who had followed them, sat down warily opposite him and
        pricked up her ears. The sun was setting behind a thick forest, and in
        the glow of sunset the birch trees, dotted about in the aspen copse,
        stood out clearly with their hanging twigs, and their buds swollen
        almost to bursting.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the thickest parts of the copse, where the snow still remained,
        came the faint sound of narrow winding threads of water running away.
        Tiny birds twittered, and now and then fluttered from tree to tree.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last
        year&rsquo;s leaves, stirred by the thawing of the earth and the growth
        of the grass.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Imagine! One can hear and see the grass growing!&rdquo; Levin
        said to himself, noticing a wet, slate-colored aspen leaf moving beside
        a blade of young grass. He stood, listened, and gazed sometimes down at
        the wet mossy ground, sometimes at Laska listening all alert, sometimes
        at the sea of bare tree tops that stretched on the slope below him,
        sometimes at the darkening sky, covered with white streaks of cloud.
      </p>

      <p>
        A hawk flew high over a forest far away with slow sweep of its wings;
        another flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and
        vanished. The birds twittered more and more loudly and busily in the
        thicket. An owl hooted not far off, and Laska, starting, stepped
        cautiously a few steps forward, and putting her head on one side, began
        to listen intently. Beyond the stream was heard the cuckoo. Twice she
        uttered her usual cuckoo call, and then gave a hoarse, hurried call and
        broke down.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Imagine! the cuckoo already!&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        coming out from behind a bush.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I hear it,&rdquo; answered Levin, reluctantly breaking the
        stillness with his voice, which sounded disagreeable to himself.
        &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s figure again went behind the bush, and Levin
        saw nothing but the bright flash of a match, followed by the red glow
        and blue smoke of a cigarette.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Tchk! tchk!&rdquo; came the snapping sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch
        cocking his gun.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that cry?&rdquo; asked Oblonsky, drawing
        Levin&rsquo;s attention to a prolonged cry, as though a colt were
        whinnying in a high voice, in play.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you know it? That&rsquo;s the hare. But enough
        talking! Listen, it&rsquo;s flying!&rdquo; almost shrieked Levin,
        cocking his gun.
      </p>

      <p>
        They heard a shrill whistle in the distance, and in the exact time, so
        well known to the sportsman, two seconds later&mdash;another, a third,
        and after the third whistle the hoarse, guttural cry could be heard.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin looked about him to right and to left, and there, just facing him
        against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of
        the aspens, he saw the flying bird. It was flying straight towards him;
        the guttural cry, like the even tearing of some strong stuff, sounded
        close to his ear; the long beak and neck of the bird could be seen, and
        at the very instant when Levin was taking aim, behind the bush where
        Oblonsky stood, there was a flash of red lightning: the bird dropped
        like an arrow, and darted upwards again. Again came the red flash and
        the sound of a blow, and fluttering its wings as though trying to keep
        up in the air, the bird halted, stopped still an instant, and fell with
        a heavy splash on the slushy ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Can I have missed it?&rdquo; shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch, who
        could not see for the smoke.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; said Levin, pointing to Laska, who with one
        ear raised, wagging the end of her shaggy tail, came slowly back as
        though she would prolong the pleasure, and as it were smiling, brought
        the dead bird to her master. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you were
        successful,&rdquo; said Levin, who, at the same time, had a sense of
        envy that he had not succeeded in shooting the snipe.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It was a bad shot from the right barrel,&rdquo; responded Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, loading his gun. &ldquo;Sh... it&rsquo;s flying!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard again. Two
        snipe, playing and chasing one another, and only whistling, not crying,
        flew straight at the very heads of the sportsmen. There was the report
        of four shots, and like swallows the snipe turned swift somersaults in
        the air and vanished from sight.
      </p>

      <p class="p2">
        The stand-shooting was capital. Stepan Arkadyevitch shot two more birds
        and Levin two, of which one was not found. It began to get dark. Venus,
        bright and silvery, shone with her soft light low down in the west
        behind the birch trees, and high up in the east twinkled the red lights
        of Arcturus. Over his head Levin made out the stars of the Great Bear
        and lost them again. The snipe had ceased flying; but Levin resolved to
        stay a little longer, till Venus, which he saw below a branch of birch,
        should be above it, and the stars of the Great Bear should be perfectly
        plain. Venus had risen above the branch, and the ear of the Great Bear
        with its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky,
        yet still he waited.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it time to go home?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was quite still now in the copse, and not a bird was stirring.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stay a little while,&rdquo; answered Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;As you like.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        They were standing now about fifteen paces from one another.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Stiva!&rdquo; said Levin unexpectedly; &ldquo;how is it you
        don&rsquo;t tell me whether your sister-in-law&rsquo;s married yet, or
        when she&rsquo;s going to be?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer, he fancied, could
        affect him. But he had never dreamed of what Stepan Arkadyevitch
        replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s never thought of being married, and isn&rsquo;t
        thinking of it; but she&rsquo;s very ill, and the doctors have sent her
        abroad. They&rsquo;re positively afraid she may not live.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Levin. &ldquo;Very ill? What is wrong with
        her? How has she...?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        While they were saying this, Laska, with ears pricked up, was looking
        upwards at the sky, and reproachfully at them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They have chosen a time to talk,&rdquo; she was thinking.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on the wing.... Here it is, yes, it is. They&rsquo;ll
        miss it,&rdquo; thought Laska.
      </p>

      <p>
        But at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle which, as
        it were, smote on their ears, and both suddenly seized their guns and
        two flashes gleamed, and two bangs sounded at the very same instant. The
        snipe flying high above instantly folded its wings and fell into a
        thicket, bending down the delicate shoots.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Splendid! Together!&rdquo; cried Levin, and he ran with Laska
        into the thicket to look for the snipe.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, what was it that was unpleasant?&rdquo; he wondered.
        &ldquo;Yes, Kitty&rsquo;s ill.... Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped;
        I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s found it! Isn&rsquo;t she a clever thing?&rdquo; he
        said, taking the warm bird from Laska&rsquo;s mouth and packing it into
        the almost full game bag. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it, Stiva!&rdquo; he
        shouted.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 16</h3>

      <p>
        On the way home Levin asked all details of Kitty&rsquo;s illness and the
        Shtcherbatskys&rsquo; plans, and though he would have been ashamed to
        admit it, he was pleased at what he heard. He was pleased that there was
        still hope, and still more pleased that she should be suffering who had
        made him suffer so much. But when Stepan Arkadyevitch began to speak of
        the causes of Kitty&rsquo;s illness, and mentioned Vronsky&rsquo;s name,
        Levin cut him short.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have no right whatever to know family matters, and, to tell the
        truth, no interest in them either.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled hardly perceptibly, catching the
        instantaneous change he knew so well in Levin&rsquo;s face, which had
        become as gloomy as it had been bright a minute before.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you quite settled about the forest with Ryabinin?&rdquo;
        asked Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s settled. The price is magnificent; thirty-eight
        thousand. Eight straight away, and the rest in six years. I&rsquo;ve
        been bothering about it for ever so long. No one would give more.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve as good as given away your forest for
        nothing,&rdquo; said Levin gloomily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you mean for nothing?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch with
        a good-humored smile, knowing that nothing would be right in
        Levin&rsquo;s eyes now.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Because the forest is worth at least a hundred and fifty roubles
        the acre,&rdquo; answered Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, these farmers!&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch playfully.
        &ldquo;Your tone of contempt for us poor townsfolk!... But when it comes
        to business, we do it better than anyone. I assure you I have reckoned
        it all out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the forest is fetching a very
        good price&mdash;so much so that I&rsquo;m afraid of this fellow&rsquo;s
        crying off, in fact. You know it&rsquo;s not
        &lsquo;timber,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, hoping by this
        distinction to convince Levin completely of the unfairness of his
        doubts. &ldquo;And it won&rsquo;t run to more than twenty-five yards of
        fagots per acre, and he&rsquo;s giving me at the rate of seventy roubles
        the acre.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin smiled contemptuously. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he thought,
        &ldquo;that fashion not only in him, but in all city people, who, after
        being twice in ten years in the country, pick up two or three phrases
        and use them in season and out of season, firmly persuaded that they
        know all about it. &lsquo;<i>Timber, run to so many yards the acre.</i
        >&rsquo; He says those words without understanding them himself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t attempt to teach you what you write about in
        your office,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and if need arose, I should come to
        you to ask about it. But you&rsquo;re so positive you know all the lore
        of the forest. It&rsquo;s difficult. Have you counted the trees?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How count the trees?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing,
        still trying to draw his friend out of his ill-temper. &ldquo;Count the
        sands of the sea, number the stars. Some higher power might do
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, the higher power of Ryabinin can. Not a single merchant
        ever buys a forest without counting the trees, unless they get it given
        them for nothing, as you&rsquo;re doing now. I know your forest. I go
        there every year shooting, and your forest&rsquo;s worth a hundred and
        fifty roubles an acre paid down, while he&rsquo;s giving you sixty by
        installments. So that in fact you&rsquo;re making him a present of
        thirty thousand.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t let your imagination run away with you,&rdquo;
        said Stepan Arkadyevitch piteously. &ldquo;Why was it none would give
        it, then?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, because he has an understanding with the merchants;
        he&rsquo;s bought them off. I&rsquo;ve had to do with all of them; I
        know them. They&rsquo;re not merchants, you know: they&rsquo;re
        speculators. He wouldn&rsquo;t look at a bargain that gave him ten,
        fifteen per cent. profit, but holds back to buy a rouble&rsquo;s worth
        for twenty kopecks.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, enough of it! You&rsquo;re out of temper.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not the least,&rdquo; said Levin gloomily, as they drove up to
        the house.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather,
        with a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar-straps. In the
        trap sat the chubby, tightly belted clerk who served Ryabinin as
        coachman. Ryabinin himself was already in the house, and met the friends
        in the hall. Ryabinin was a tall, thinnish, middle-aged man, with
        mustache and a projecting clean-shaven chin, and prominent muddy-looking
        eyes. He was dressed in a long-skirted blue coat, with buttons below the
        waist at the back, and wore high boots wrinkled over the ankles and
        straight over the calf, with big galoshes drawn over them. He rubbed his
        face with his handkerchief, and wrapping round him his coat, which sat
        extremely well as it was, he greeted them with a smile, holding out his
        hand to Stepan Arkadyevitch, as though he wanted to catch something.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So here you are,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, giving him his
        hand. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s capital.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I did not venture to disregard your excellency&rsquo;s commands,
        though the road was extremely bad. I positively walked the whole way,
        but I am here at my time. Konstantin Dmitrievitch, my respects&rdquo;;
        he turned to Levin, trying to seize his hand too. But Levin, scowling,
        made as though he did not notice his hand, and took out the snipe.
        &ldquo;Your honors have been diverting yourselves with the chase? What
        kind of bird may it be, pray?&rdquo; added Ryabinin, looking
        contemptuously at the snipe: &ldquo;a great delicacy, I suppose.&rdquo;
        And he shook his head disapprovingly, as though he had grave doubts
        whether this game were worth the candle.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Would you like to go into my study?&rdquo; Levin said in French
        to Stepan Arkadyevitch, scowling morosely. &ldquo;Go into my study; you
        can talk there.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Quite so, where you please,&rdquo; said Ryabinin with
        contemptuous dignity, as though wishing to make it felt that others
        might be in difficulties as to how to behave, but that he could never be
        in any difficulty about anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        On entering the study Ryabinin looked about, as his habit was, as though
        seeking the holy picture, but when he had found it, he did not cross
        himself. He scanned the bookcases and bookshelves, and with the same
        dubious air with which he had regarded the snipe, he smiled
        contemptuously and shook his head disapprovingly, as though by no means
        willing to allow that this game were worth the candle.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, have you brought the money?&rdquo; asked Oblonsky.
        &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t trouble about the money. I&rsquo;ve come to see
        you to talk it over.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is there to talk over? But do sit down.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if I do,&rdquo; said Ryabinin, sitting down
        and leaning his elbows on the back of his chair in a position of the
        intensest discomfort to himself. &ldquo;You must knock it down a bit,
        prince. It would be too bad. The money is ready conclusively to the last
        farthing. As to paying the money down, there&rsquo;ll be no hitch
        there.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin, who had meanwhile been putting his gun away in the cupboard, was
        just going out of the door, but catching the merchant&rsquo;s words, he
        stopped.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve got the forest for nothing as it is,&rdquo; he
        said. &ldquo;He came to me too late, or I&rsquo;d have fixed the price
        for him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Ryabinin got up, and in silence, with a smile, he looked Levin down and
        up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very close about money is Konstantin Dmitrievitch,&rdquo; he said
        with a smile, turning to Stepan Arkadyevitch; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
        positively no dealing with him. I was bargaining for some wheat of him,
        and a pretty price I offered too.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why should I give you my goods for nothing? I didn&rsquo;t pick
        it up on the ground, nor steal it either.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mercy on us! nowadays there&rsquo;s no chance at all of stealing.
        With the open courts and everything done in style, nowadays
        there&rsquo;s no question of stealing. We are just talking things over
        like gentlemen. His excellency&rsquo;s asking too much for the forest. I
        can&rsquo;t make both ends meet over it. I must ask for a little
        concession.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But is the thing settled between you or not? If it&rsquo;s
        settled, it&rsquo;s useless haggling; but if it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; said
        Levin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy the forest.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The smile vanished at once from Ryabinin&rsquo;s face. A hawklike,
        greedy, cruel expression was left upon it. With rapid, bony fingers he
        unbuttoned his coat, revealing a shirt, bronze waistcoat buttons, and a
        watch chain, and quickly pulled out a fat old pocketbook.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here you are, the forest is mine,&rdquo; he said, crossing
        himself quickly, and holding out his hand. &ldquo;Take the money;
        it&rsquo;s my forest. That&rsquo;s Ryabinin&rsquo;s way of doing
        business; he doesn&rsquo;t haggle over every half-penny,&rdquo; he
        added, scowling and waving the pocketbook.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be in a hurry if I were you,&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, really,&rdquo; said Oblonsky in surprise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
        given my word, you know.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin went out of the room, slamming the door. Ryabinin looked towards
        the door and shook his head with a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all youthfulness&mdash;positively nothing but
        boyishness. Why, I&rsquo;m buying it, upon my honor, simply, believe me,
        for the glory of it, that Ryabinin, and no one else, should have bought
        the copse of Oblonsky. And as to the profits, why, I must make what God
        gives. In God&rsquo;s name. If you would kindly sign the
        title-deed....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Within an hour the merchant, stroking his big overcoat neatly down, and
        hooking up his jacket, with the agreement in his pocket, seated himself
        in his tightly covered trap, and drove homewards.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ugh, these gentlefolks!&rdquo; he said to the clerk.
        &ldquo;They&mdash;they&rsquo;re a nice lot!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; responded the clerk, handing him the
        reins and buttoning the leather apron. &ldquo;But I can congratulate you
        on the purchase, Mihail Ignatitch?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, well....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 17</h3>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch went upstairs with his pocket bulging with notes,
        which the merchant had paid him for three months in advance. The
        business of the forest was over, the money in his pocket; their shooting
        had been excellent, and Stepan Arkadyevitch was in the happiest frame of
        mind, and so he felt specially anxious to dissipate the ill-humor that
        had come upon Levin. He wanted to finish the day at supper as pleasantly
        as it had been begun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin certainly was out of humor, and in spite of all his desire to be
        affectionate and cordial to his charming visitor, he could not control
        his mood. The intoxication of the news that Kitty was not married had
        gradually begun to work upon him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty was not married, but ill, and ill from love for a man who had
        slighted her. This slight, as it were, rebounded upon him. Vronsky had
        slighted her, and she had slighted him, Levin. Consequently Vronsky had
        the right to despise Levin, and therefore he was his enemy. But all this
        Levin did not think out. He vaguely felt that there was something in it
        insulting to him, and he was not angry now at what had disturbed him,
        but he fell foul of everything that presented itself. The stupid sale of
        the forest, the fraud practiced upon Oblonsky and concluded in his
        house, exasperated him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, finished?&rdquo; he said, meeting Stepan Arkadyevitch
        upstairs. &ldquo;Would you like supper?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t say no to it. What an appetite I get in
        the country! Wonderful! Why didn&rsquo;t you offer Ryabinin
        something?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, damn him!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Still, how you do treat him!&rdquo; said Oblonsky. &ldquo;You
        didn&rsquo;t even shake hands with him. Why not shake hands with
        him?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t shake hands with a waiter, and a
        waiter&rsquo;s a hundred times better than he is.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a reactionist you are, really! What about the amalgamation
        of classes?&rdquo; said Oblonsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anyone who likes amalgamating is welcome to it, but it sickens
        me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a regular reactionist, I see.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Really, I have never considered what I am. I am Konstantin Levin,
        and nothing else.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And Konstantin Levin very much out of temper,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why?
        Because&mdash;excuse me&mdash;of your stupid sale....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned good-humoredly, like one who feels himself
        teased and attacked for no fault of his own.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, enough about it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When did anybody
        ever sell anything without being told immediately after the sale,
        &lsquo;It was worth much more&rsquo;? But when one wants to sell, no one
        will give anything.... No, I see you&rsquo;ve a grudge against that
        unlucky Ryabinin.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Maybe I have. And do you know why? You&rsquo;ll say again that
        I&rsquo;m a reactionist, or some other terrible word; but all the same
        it does annoy and anger me to see on all sides the impoverishing of the
        nobility to which I belong, and, in spite of the amalgamation of
        classes, I&rsquo;m glad to belong. And their impoverishment is not due
        to extravagance&mdash;that would be nothing; living in good
        style&mdash;that&rsquo;s the proper thing for noblemen; it&rsquo;s only
        the nobles who know how to do it. Now the peasants about us buy land,
        and I don&rsquo;t mind that. The gentleman does nothing, while the
        peasant works and supplants the idle man. That&rsquo;s as it ought to
        be. And I&rsquo;m very glad for the peasant. But I do mind seeing the
        process of impoverishment from a sort of&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what
        to call it&mdash;innocence. Here a Polish speculator bought for half its
        value a magnificent estate from a young lady who lives in Nice. And
        there a merchant will get three acres of land, worth ten roubles, as
        security for the loan of one rouble. Here, for no kind of reason,
        you&rsquo;ve made that rascal a present of thirty thousand
        roubles.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what should I have done? Counted every tree?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course, they must be counted. You didn&rsquo;t count them, but
        Ryabinin did. Ryabinin&rsquo;s children will have means of livelihood
        and education, while yours maybe will not!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you must excuse me, but there&rsquo;s something mean in
        this counting. We have our business and they have theirs, and they must
        make their profit. Anyway, the thing&rsquo;s done, and there&rsquo;s an
        end of it. And here come some poached eggs, my favorite dish. And Agafea
        Mihalovna will give us that marvelous herb-brandy....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch sat down at the table and began joking with Agafea
        Mihalovna, assuring her that it was long since he had tasted such a
        dinner and such a supper.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you do praise it, anyway,&rdquo; said Agafea Mihalovna,
        &ldquo;but Konstantin Dmitrievitch, give him what you will&mdash;a crust
        of bread&mdash;he&rsquo;ll eat it and walk away.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Though Levin tried to control himself, he was gloomy and silent. He
        wanted to put one question to Stepan Arkadyevitch, but he could not
        bring himself to the point, and could not find the words or the moment
        in which to put it. Stepan Arkadyevitch had gone down to his room,
        undressed, again washed, and attired in a nightshirt with goffered
        frills, he had got into bed, but Levin still lingered in his room,
        talking of various trifling matters, and not daring to ask what he
        wanted to know.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How wonderfully they make this soap,&rdquo; he said gazing at a
        piece of soap he was handling, which Agafea Mihalovna had put ready for
        the visitor but Oblonsky had not used. &ldquo;Only look; why, it&rsquo;s
        a work of art.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, everything&rsquo;s brought to such a pitch of perfection
        nowadays,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, with a moist and blissful
        yawn. &ldquo;The theater, for instance, and the entertainments ...
        a&mdash;a&mdash;a!&rdquo; he yawned. &ldquo;The electric light
        everywhere ... a&mdash;a&mdash;a!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, the electric light,&rdquo; said Levin. &ldquo;Yes. Oh, and
        where&rsquo;s Vronsky now?&rdquo; he asked suddenly, laying down the
        soap.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Vronsky?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, checking his yawn;
        &ldquo;he&rsquo;s in Petersburg. He left soon after you did, and
        he&rsquo;s not once been in Moscow since. And do you know, Kostya,
        I&rsquo;ll tell you the truth,&rdquo; he went on, leaning his elbow on
        the table, and propping on his hand his handsome ruddy face, in which
        his moist, good-natured, sleepy eyes shone like stars. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
        your own fault. You took fright at the sight of your rival. But, as I
        told you at the time, I couldn&rsquo;t say which had the better chance.
        Why didn&rsquo;t you fight it out? I told you at the time
        that....&rdquo; He yawned inwardly, without opening his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Does he know, or doesn&rsquo;t he, that I did make an
        offer?&rdquo; Levin wondered, gazing at him. &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s
        something humbugging, diplomatic in his face,&rdquo; and feeling he was
        blushing, he looked Stepan Arkadyevitch straight in the face without
        speaking.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If there was anything on her side at the time, it was nothing but
        a superficial attraction,&rdquo; pursued Oblonsky. &ldquo;His being such
        a perfect aristocrat, don&rsquo;t you know, and his future position in
        society, had an influence not with her, but with her mother.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin scowled. The humiliation of his rejection stung him to the heart,
        as though it were a fresh wound he had only just received. But he was at
        home, and the walls of home are a support.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Stay, stay,&rdquo; he began, interrupting Oblonsky. &ldquo;You
        talk of his being an aristocrat. But allow me to ask what it consists
        in, that aristocracy of Vronsky or of anybody else, beside which I can
        be looked down upon? You consider Vronsky an aristocrat, but I
        don&rsquo;t. A man whose father crawled up from nothing at all by
        intrigue, and whose mother&mdash;God knows whom she wasn&rsquo;t mixed
        up with.... No, excuse me, but I consider myself aristocratic, and
        people like me, who can point back in the past to three or four
        honorable generations of their family, of the highest degree of breeding
        (talent and intellect, of course that&rsquo;s another matter), and have
        never curried favor with anyone, never depended on anyone for anything,
        like my father and my grandfather. And I know many such. You think it
        mean of me to count the trees in my forest, while you make Ryabinin a
        present of thirty thousand; but you get rents from your lands and I
        don&rsquo;t know what, while I don&rsquo;t and so I prize what&rsquo;s
        come to me from my ancestors or been won by hard work.... We are
        aristocrats, and not those who can only exist by favor of the powerful
        of this world, and who can be bought for twopence halfpenny.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, but whom are you attacking? I agree with you,&rdquo; said
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, sincerely and genially; though he was aware that in
        the class of those who could be bought for twopence halfpenny Levin was
        reckoning him too. Levin&rsquo;s warmth gave him genuine pleasure.
        &ldquo;Whom are you attacking? Though a good deal is not true that you
        say about Vronsky, but I won&rsquo;t talk about that. I tell you
        straight out, if I were you, I should go back with me to Moscow,
        and....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t know whether you know it or not, but I
        don&rsquo;t care. And I tell you&mdash;I did make an offer and was
        rejected, and Katerina Alexandrovna is nothing now to me but a painful
        and humiliating reminiscence.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What ever for? What nonsense!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t talk about it. Please forgive me, if
        I&rsquo;ve been nasty,&rdquo; said Levin. Now that he had opened his
        heart, he became as he had been in the morning. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
        angry with me, Stiva? Please don&rsquo;t be angry,&rdquo; he said, and
        smiling, he took his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course not; not a bit, and no reason to be. I&rsquo;m glad
        we&rsquo;ve spoken openly. And do you know, stand-shooting in the
        morning is unusually good&mdash;why not go? I couldn&rsquo;t sleep the
        night anyway, but I might go straight from shooting to the
        station.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Capital.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 18</h3>

      <p>
        Although all Vronsky&rsquo;s inner life was absorbed in his passion, his
        external life unalterably and inevitably followed along the old
        accustomed lines of his social and regimental ties and interests. The
        interests of his regiment took an important place in Vronsky&rsquo;s
        life, both because he was fond of the regiment, and because the regiment
        was fond of him. They were not only fond of Vronsky in his regiment,
        they respected him too, and were proud of him; proud that this man, with
        his immense wealth, his brilliant education and abilities, and the path
        open before him to every kind of success, distinction, and ambition, had
        disregarded all that, and of all the interests of life had the interests
        of his regiment and his comrades nearest to his heart. Vronsky was aware
        of his comrades&rsquo; view of him, and in addition to his liking for
        the life, he felt bound to keep up that reputation.
      </p>

      <p>
        It need not be said that he did not speak of his love to any of his
        comrades, nor did he betray his secret even in the wildest drinking
        bouts (though indeed he was never so drunk as to lose all control of
        himself). And he shut up any of his thoughtless comrades who attempted
        to allude to his connection. But in spite of that, his love was known to
        all the town; everyone guessed with more or less confidence at his
        relations with Madame Karenina. The majority of the younger men envied
        him for just what was the most irksome factor in his love&mdash;the
        exalted position of Karenin, and the consequent publicity of their
        connection in society.
      </p>

      <p>
        The greater number of the young women, who envied Anna and had long been
        weary of hearing her called <i>virtuous</i>, rejoiced at the fulfillment
        of their predictions, and were only waiting for a decisive turn in
        public opinion to fall upon her with all the weight of their scorn. They
        were already making ready their handfuls of mud to fling at her when the
        right moment arrived. The greater number of the middle-aged people and
        certain great personages were displeased at the prospect of the
        impending scandal in society.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky&rsquo;s mother, on hearing of his connection, was at first
        pleased at it, because nothing to her mind gave such a finishing touch
        to a brilliant young man as a <i>liaison</i> in the highest society; she
        was pleased, too, that Madame Karenina, who had so taken her fancy, and
        had talked so much of her son, was, after all, just like all other
        pretty and well-bred women,&mdash;at least according to the Countess
        Vronskaya&rsquo;s ideas. But she had heard of late that her son had
        refused a position offered him of great importance to his career, simply
        in order to remain in the regiment, where he could be constantly seeing
        Madame Karenina. She learned that great personages were displeased with
        him on this account, and she changed her opinion. She was vexed, too,
        that from all she could learn of this connection it was not that
        brilliant, graceful, worldly <i>liaison</i> which she would have
        welcomed, but a sort of Wertherish, desperate passion, so she was told,
        which might well lead him into imprudence. She had not seen him since
        his abrupt departure from Moscow, and she sent her elder son to bid him
        come to see her.
      </p>

      <p>
        This elder son, too, was displeased with his younger brother. He did not
        distinguish what sort of love his might be, big or little, passionate or
        passionless, lasting or passing (he kept a ballet girl himself, though
        he was the father of a family, so he was lenient in these matters), but
        he knew that this love affair was viewed with displeasure by those whom
        it was necessary to please, and therefore he did not approve of his
        brother&rsquo;s conduct.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides the service and society, Vronsky had another great
        interest&mdash;horses; he was passionately fond of horses.
      </p>

      <p>
        That year races and a steeplechase had been arranged for the officers.
        Vronsky had put his name down, bought a thoroughbred English mare, and
        in spite of his love affair, he was looking forward to the races with
        intense, though reserved, excitement....
      </p>

      <p>
        These two passions did not interfere with one another. On the contrary,
        he needed occupation and distraction quite apart from his love, so as to
        recruit and rest himself from the violent emotions that agitated him.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 19</h3>

      <p>
        On the day of the races at Krasnoe Selo, Vronsky had come earlier than
        usual to eat beefsteak in the common messroom of the regiment. He had no
        need to be strict with himself, as he had very quickly been brought down
        to the required light weight; but still he had to avoid gaining flesh,
        and so he eschewed farinaceous and sweet dishes. He sat with his coat
        unbuttoned over a white waistcoat, resting both elbows on the table, and
        while waiting for the steak he had ordered he looked at a French novel
        that lay open on his plate. He was only looking at the book to avoid
        conversation with the officers coming in and out; he was thinking.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was thinking of Anna&rsquo;s promise to see him that day after the
        races. But he had not seen her for three days, and as her husband had
        just returned from abroad, he did not know whether she would be able to
        meet him today or not, and he did not know how to find out. He had had
        his last interview with her at his cousin Betsy&rsquo;s summer villa. He
        visited the Karenins&rsquo; summer villa as rarely as possible. Now he
        wanted to go there, and he pondered the question how to do it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course I shall say Betsy has sent me to ask whether
        she&rsquo;s coming to the races. Of course, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; he
        decided, lifting his head from the book. And as he vividly pictured the
        happiness of seeing her, his face lighted up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Send to my house, and tell them to have out the carriage and
        three horses as quick as they can,&rdquo; he said to the servant, who
        handed him the steak on a hot silver dish, and moving the dish up he
        began eating.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the billiard room next door came the sound of balls knocking, of
        talk and laughter. Two officers appeared at the entrance-door: one, a
        young fellow, with a feeble, delicate face, who had lately joined the
        regiment from the Corps of Pages; the other, a plump, elderly officer,
        with a bracelet on his wrist, and little eyes, lost in fat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky glanced at them, frowned, and looking down at his book as though
        he had not noticed them, he proceeded to eat and read at the same time.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What? Fortifying yourself for your work?&rdquo; said the plump
        officer, sitting down beside him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;As you see,&rdquo; responded Vronsky, knitting his brows, wiping
        his mouth, and not looking at the officer.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not afraid of getting fat?&rdquo; said the
        latter, turning a chair round for the young officer.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Vronsky angrily, making a wry face of disgust,
        and showing his even teeth.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not afraid of getting fat?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Waiter, sherry!&rdquo; said Vronsky, without replying, and moving
        the book to the other side of him, he went on reading.
      </p>

      <p>
        The plump officer took up the list of wines and turned to the young
        officer.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You choose what we&rsquo;re to drink,&rdquo; he said, handing him
        the card, and looking at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Rhine wine, please,&rdquo; said the young officer, stealing a
        timid glance at Vronsky, and trying to pull his scarcely visible
        mustache. Seeing that Vronsky did not turn round, the young officer got
        up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go into the billiard room,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        The plump officer rose submissively, and they moved towards the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment there walked into the room the tall and well-built
        Captain Yashvin. Nodding with an air of lofty contempt to the two
        officers, he went up to Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! here he is!&rdquo; he cried, bringing his big hand down
        heavily on his epaulet. Vronsky looked round angrily, but his face
        lighted up immediately with his characteristic expression of genial and
        manly serenity.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Alexey,&rdquo; said the captain, in his loud
        baritone. &ldquo;You must just eat a mouthful, now, and drink only one
        tiny glass.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not hungry.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There go the inseparables,&rdquo; Yashvin dropped, glancing
        sarcastically at the two officers who were at that instant leaving the
        room. And he bent his long legs, swathed in tight riding breeches, and
        sat down in the chair, too low for him, so that his knees were cramped
        up in a sharp angle.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you turn up at the Red Theater yesterday?
        Numerova wasn&rsquo;t at all bad. Where were you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I was late at the Tverskoys&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; responded Yashvin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yashvin, a gambler and a rake, a man not merely without moral
        principles, but of immoral principles, Yashvin was Vronsky&rsquo;s
        greatest friend in the regiment. Vronsky liked him both for his
        exceptional physical strength, which he showed for the most part by
        being able to drink like a fish, and do without sleep without being in
        the slightest degree affected by it; and for his great strength of
        character, which he showed in his relations with his comrades and
        superior officers, commanding both fear and respect, and also at cards,
        when he would play for tens of thousands and however much he might have
        drunk, always with such skill and decision that he was reckoned the best
        player in the English Club. Vronsky respected and liked Yashvin
        particularly because he felt Yashvin liked him, not for his name and his
        money, but for himself. And of all men he was the only one with whom
        Vronsky would have liked to speak of his love. He felt that Yashvin, in
        spite of his apparent contempt for every sort of feeling, was the only
        man who could, so he fancied, comprehend the intense passion which now
        filled his whole life. Moreover, he felt certain that Yashvin, as it
        was, took no delight in gossip and scandal, and interpreted his feeling
        rightly, that is to say, knew and believed that this passion was not a
        jest, not a pastime, but something more serious and important.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky had never spoken to him of his passion, but he was aware that he
        knew all about it, and that he put the right interpretation on it, and
        he was glad to see that in his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! yes,&rdquo; he said, to the announcement that Vronsky had
        been at the Tverskoys&rsquo;; and his black eyes shining, he plucked at
        his left mustache, and began twisting it into his mouth, a bad habit he
        had.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and what did you do yesterday? Win anything?&rdquo; asked
        Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Eight thousand. But three don&rsquo;t count; he won&rsquo;t pay
        up.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, then you can afford to lose over me,&rdquo; said Vronsky,
        laughing. (Yashvin had bet heavily on Vronsky in the races.)
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No chance of my losing. Mahotin&rsquo;s the only one that&rsquo;s
        risky.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And the conversation passed to forecasts of the coming race, the only
        thing Vronsky could think of just now.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come along, I&rsquo;ve finished,&rdquo; said Vronsky, and getting
        up he went to the door. Yashvin got up too, stretching his long legs and
        his long back.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early for me to dine, but I must have a drink.
        I&rsquo;ll come along directly. Hi, wine!&rdquo; he shouted, in his rich
        voice, that always rang out so loudly at drill, and set the windows
        shaking now.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, all right,&rdquo; he shouted again immediately after.
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going home, so I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he walked out with Vronsky.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 20</h3>

      <p>
        Vronsky was staying in a roomy, clean, Finnish hut, divided into two by
        a partition. Petritsky lived with him in camp too. Petritsky was asleep
        when Vronsky and Yashvin came into the hut.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Get up, don&rsquo;t go on sleeping,&rdquo; said Yashvin, going
        behind the partition and giving Petritsky, who was lying with ruffled
        hair and with his nose in the pillow, a prod on the shoulder.
      </p>

      <p>
        Petritsky jumped up suddenly onto his knees and looked round.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Your brother&rsquo;s been here,&rdquo; he said to Vronsky.
        &ldquo;He waked me up, damn him, and said he&rsquo;d look in
        again.&rdquo; And pulling up the rug he flung himself back on the
        pillow. &ldquo;Oh, do shut up, Yashvin!&rdquo; he said, getting furious
        with Yashvin, who was pulling the rug off him. &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; He
        turned over and opened his eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better tell me what
        to drink; such a nasty taste in my mouth, that....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Brandy&rsquo;s better than anything,&rdquo; boomed Yashvin.
        &ldquo;Tereshtchenko! brandy for your master and cucumbers,&rdquo; he
        shouted, obviously taking pleasure in the sound of his own voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Brandy, do you think? Eh?&rdquo; queried Petritsky, blinking and
        rubbing his eyes. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll drink something? All right
        then, we&rsquo;ll have a drink together! Vronsky, have a drink?&rdquo;
        said Petritsky, getting up and wrapping the tiger-skin rug round him. He
        went to the door of the partition wall, raised his hands, and hummed in
        French, &ldquo;There was a king in Thule.&rdquo; &ldquo;Vronsky, will
        you have a drink?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Go along,&rdquo; said Vronsky, putting on the coat his valet
        handed to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where are you off to?&rdquo; asked Yashvin. &ldquo;Oh, here are
        your three horses,&rdquo; he added, seeing the carriage drive up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To the stables, and I&rsquo;ve got to see Bryansky, too, about
        the horses,&rdquo; said Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky had as a fact promised to call at Bryansky&rsquo;s, some eight
        miles from Peterhof, and to bring him some money owing for some horses;
        and he hoped to have time to get that in too. But his comrades were at
        once aware that he was not only going there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Petritsky, still humming, winked and made a pout with his lips, as
        though he would say: &ldquo;Oh, yes, we know your Bryansky.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mind you&rsquo;re not late!&rdquo; was Yashvin&rsquo;s only
        comment; and to change the conversation: &ldquo;How&rsquo;s my roan? is
        he doing all right?&rdquo; he inquired, looking out of the window at the
        middle one of the three horses, which he had sold Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Petritsky to Vronsky as he was just going out.
        &ldquo;Your brother left a letter and a note for you. Wait a bit; where
        are they?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky stopped.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, where are they?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where are they? That&rsquo;s just the question!&rdquo; said
        Petritsky solemnly, moving his forefinger upwards from his nose.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, tell me; this is silly!&rdquo; said Vronsky smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have not lighted the fire. Here somewhere about.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, enough fooling! Where is the letter?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve forgotten really. Or was it a dream? Wait a bit,
        wait a bit! But what&rsquo;s the use of getting in a rage. If
        you&rsquo;d drunk four bottles yesterday as I did you&rsquo;d forget
        where you were lying. Wait a bit, I&rsquo;ll remember!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Petritsky went behind the partition and lay down on his bed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Wait a bit! This was how I was lying, and this was how he was
        standing. Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes.... Here it is!&rdquo;&mdash;and
        Petritsky pulled a letter out from under the mattress, where he had
        hidden it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky took the letter and his brother&rsquo;s note. It was the letter
        he was expecting&mdash;from his mother, reproaching him for not having
        been to see her&mdash;and the note was from his brother to say that he
        must have a little talk with him. Vronsky knew that it was all about the
        same thing. &ldquo;What business is it of theirs!&rdquo; thought
        Vronsky, and crumpling up the letters he thrust them between the buttons
        of his coat so as to read them carefully on the road. In the porch of
        the hut he was met by two officers; one of his regiment and one of
        another.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky&rsquo;s quarters were always a meeting place for all the
        officers.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where are you off to?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I must go to Peterhof.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Has the mare come from Tsarskoe?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;ve not seen her yet.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They say Mahotin&rsquo;s Gladiator&rsquo;s lame.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nonsense! But however are you going to race in this mud?&rdquo;
        said the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here are my saviors!&rdquo; cried Petritsky, seeing them come in.
        Before him stood the orderly with a tray of brandy and salted cucumbers.
        &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Yashvin ordering me to drink a pick-me-up.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you did give it to us yesterday,&rdquo; said one of those
        who had come in; &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t let us get a wink of sleep all
        night.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t we make a pretty finish!&rdquo; said Petritsky.
        &ldquo;Volkov climbed onto the roof and began telling us how sad he was.
        I said: &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have music, the funeral march!&rsquo; He
        fairly dropped asleep on the roof over the funeral march.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Drink it up; you positively must drink the brandy, and then
        seltzer water and a lot of lemon,&rdquo; said Yashvin, standing over
        Petritsky like a mother making a child take medicine, &ldquo;and then a
        little champagne&mdash;just a small bottle.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, there&rsquo;s some sense in that. Stop a bit, Vronsky.
        We&rsquo;ll all have a drink.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; good-bye all of you. I&rsquo;m not going to drink
        today.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, are you gaining weight? All right, then we must have it
        alone. Give us the seltzer water and lemon.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Vronsky!&rdquo; shouted someone when he was already outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get your hair cut, it&rsquo;ll weigh you down,
        especially at the top.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky was in fact beginning, prematurely, to get a little bald. He
        laughed gaily, showing his even teeth, and pulling his cap over the thin
        place, went out and got into his carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To the stables!&rdquo; he said, and was just pulling out the
        letters to read them through, but he thought better of it, and put off
        reading them so as not to distract his attention before looking at the
        mare. &ldquo;Later!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 21</h3>

      <p>
        The temporary stable, a wooden shed, had been put up close to the race
        course, and there his mare was to have been taken the previous day. He
        had not yet seen her there.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the last few days he had not ridden her out for exercise himself,
        but had put her in the charge of the trainer, and so now he positively
        did not know in what condition his mare had arrived yesterday and was
        today. He had scarcely got out of his carriage when his groom, the
        so-called &ldquo;stable boy,&rdquo; recognizing the carriage some way
        off, called the trainer. A dry-looking Englishman, in high boots and a
        short jacket, clean-shaven, except for a tuft below his chin, came to
        meet him, walking with the uncouth gait of jockey, turning his elbows
        out and swaying from side to side.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, how&rsquo;s Frou-Frou?&rdquo; Vronsky asked in English.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; the Englishman&rsquo;s voice responded
        somewhere in the inside of his throat. &ldquo;Better not go in,&rdquo;
        he added, touching his hat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put a muzzle on her, and
        the mare&rsquo;s fidgety. Better not go in, it&rsquo;ll excite the
        mare.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going in. I want to look at her.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come along, then,&rdquo; said the Englishman, frowning, and
        speaking with his mouth shut, and, with swinging elbows, he went on in
        front with his disjointed gait.
      </p>

      <p>
        They went into the little yard in front of the shed. A stable boy,
        spruce and smart in his holiday attire, met them with a broom in his
        hand, and followed them. In the shed there were five horses in their
        separate stalls, and Vronsky knew that his chief rival, Gladiator, a
        very tall chestnut horse, had been brought there, and must be standing
        among them. Even more than his mare, Vronsky longed to see Gladiator,
        whom he had never seen. But he knew that by the etiquette of the race
        course it was not merely impossible for him to see the horse, but
        improper even to ask questions about him. Just as he was passing along
        the passage, the boy opened the door into the second horse-box on the
        left, and Vronsky caught a glimpse of a big chestnut horse with white
        legs. He knew that this was Gladiator, but, with the feeling of a man
        turning away from the sight of another man&rsquo;s open letter, he
        turned round and went into Frou-Frou&rsquo;s stall.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The horse is here belonging to Mak... Mak... I never can say the
        name,&rdquo; said the Englishman, over his shoulder, pointing his big
        finger and dirty nail towards Gladiator&rsquo;s stall.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mahotin? Yes, he&rsquo;s my most serious rival,&rdquo; said
        Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you were riding him,&rdquo; said the Englishman,
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;d bet on you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Frou-Frou&rsquo;s more nervous; he&rsquo;s stronger,&rdquo; said
        Vronsky, smiling at the compliment to his riding.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In a steeplechase it all depends on riding and on pluck,&rdquo;
        said the Englishman.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of pluck&mdash;that is, energy and courage&mdash;Vronsky did not merely
        feel that he had enough; what was of far more importance, he was firmly
        convinced that no one in the world could have more of this
        &ldquo;pluck&rdquo; than he had.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I want more thinning down?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; answered the Englishman. &ldquo;Please,
        don&rsquo;t speak loud. The mare&rsquo;s fidgety,&rdquo; he added,
        nodding towards the horse-box, before which they were standing, and from
        which came the sound of restless stamping in the straw.
      </p>

      <p>
        He opened the door, and Vronsky went into the horse-box, dimly lighted
        by one little window. In the horse-box stood a dark bay mare, with a
        muzzle on, picking at the fresh straw with her hoofs. Looking round him
        in the twilight of the horse-box, Vronsky unconsciously took in once
        more in a comprehensive glance all the points of his favorite mare.
        Frou-Frou was a beast of medium size, not altogether free from reproach,
        from a breeder&rsquo;s point of view. She was small-boned all over;
        though her chest was extremely prominent in front, it was narrow. Her
        hind-quarters were a little drooping, and in her fore-legs, and still
        more in her hind-legs, there was a noticeable curvature. The muscles of
        both hind- and fore-legs were not very thick; but across her shoulders
        the mare was exceptionally broad, a peculiarity specially striking now
        that she was lean from training. The bones of her legs below the knees
        looked no thicker than a finger from in front, but were extraordinarily
        thick seen from the side. She looked altogether, except across the
        shoulders, as it were, pinched in at the sides and pressed out in depth.
        But she had in the highest degree the quality that makes all defects
        forgotten: that quality was
        <i>blood</i>, the blood <i>that tells</i>, as the English expression has
        it. The muscles stood up sharply under the network of sinews, covered
        with the delicate, mobile skin, soft as satin, and they were hard as
        bone. Her clean-cut head, with prominent, bright, spirited eyes,
        broadened out at the open nostrils, that showed the red blood in the
        cartilage within. About all her figure, and especially her head, there
        was a certain expression of energy, and, at the same time, of softness.
        She was one of those creatures which seem only not to speak because the
        mechanism of their mouth does not allow them to.
      </p>

      <p>
        To Vronsky, at any rate, it seemed that she understood all he felt at
        that moment, looking at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Directly Vronsky went towards her, she drew in a deep breath, and,
        turning back her prominent eye till the white looked bloodshot, she
        started at the approaching figures from the opposite side, shaking her
        muzzle, and shifting lightly from one leg to the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There, you see how fidgety she is,&rdquo; said the Englishman.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There, darling! There!&rdquo; said Vronsky, going up to the mare
        and speaking soothingly to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the nearer he came, the more excited she grew. Only when he stood by
        her head, she was suddenly quieter, while the muscles quivered under her
        soft, delicate coat. Vronsky patted her strong neck, straightened over
        her sharp withers a stray lock of her mane that had fallen on the other
        side, and moved his face near her dilated nostrils, transparent as a
        bat&rsquo;s wing. She drew a loud breath and snorted out through her
        tense nostrils, started, pricked up her sharp ear, and put out her
        strong, black lip towards Vronsky, as though she would nip hold of his
        sleeve. But remembering the muzzle, she shook it and again began
        restlessly stamping one after the other her shapely legs.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Quiet, darling, quiet!&rdquo; he said, patting her again over her
        hind-quarters; and with a glad sense that his mare was in the best
        possible condition, he went out of the horse-box.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mare&rsquo;s excitement had infected Vronsky. He felt that his heart
        was throbbing, and that he, too, like the mare, longed to move, to bite;
        it was both dreadful and delicious.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I rely on you, then,&rdquo; he said to the Englishman;
        &ldquo;half-past six on the ground.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Englishman. &ldquo;Oh, where are you
        going, my lord?&rdquo; he asked suddenly, using the title &ldquo;my
        lord,&rdquo; which he had scarcely ever used before.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky in amazement raised his head, and stared, as he knew how to
        stare, not into the Englishman&rsquo;s eyes, but at his forehead,
        astounded at the impertinence of his question. But realizing that in
        asking this the Englishman had been looking at him not as an employer,
        but as a jockey, he answered:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go to Bryansky&rsquo;s; I shall be home within
        an hour.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How often I&rsquo;m asked that question today!&rdquo; he said to
        himself, and he blushed, a thing which rarely happened to him. The
        Englishman looked gravely at him; and, as though he, too, knew where
        Vronsky was going, he added:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The great thing&rsquo;s to keep quiet before a race,&rdquo; said
        he; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t get out of temper or upset about anything.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Vronsky, smiling; and jumping into his
        carriage, he told the man to drive to Peterhof.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before he had driven many paces away, the dark clouds that had been
        threatening rain all day broke, and there was a heavy downpour of rain.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; thought Vronsky, putting up the roof of the
        carriage. &ldquo;It was muddy before, now it will be a perfect
        swamp.&rdquo; As he sat in solitude in the closed carriage, he took out
        his mother&rsquo;s letter and his brother&rsquo;s note, and read them
        through.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, it was the same thing over and over again. Everyone, his mother,
        his brother, everyone thought fit to interfere in the affairs of his
        heart. This interference aroused in him a feeling of angry
        hatred&mdash;a feeling he had rarely known before. &ldquo;What business
        is it of theirs? Why does everybody feel called upon to concern himself
        about me? And why do they worry me so? Just because they see that this
        is something they can&rsquo;t understand. If it were a common, vulgar,
        worldly intrigue, they would have left me alone. They feel that this is
        something different, that this is not a mere pastime, that this woman is
        dearer to me than life. And this is incomprehensible, and that&rsquo;s
        why it annoys them. Whatever our destiny is or may be, we have made it
        ourselves, and we do not complain of it,&rdquo; he said, in the word
        <i>we</i>
        linking himself with Anna. &ldquo;No, they must needs teach us how to
        live. They haven&rsquo;t an idea of what happiness is; they don&rsquo;t
        know that without our love, for us there is neither happiness nor
        unhappiness&mdash;no life at all,&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was angry with all of them for their interference just because he
        felt in his soul that they, all these people, were right. He felt that
        the love that bound him to Anna was not a momentary impulse, which would
        pass, as worldly intrigues do pass, leaving no other traces in the life
        of either but pleasant or unpleasant memories. He felt all the torture
        of his own and her position, all the difficulty there was for them,
        conspicuous as they were in the eye of all the world, in concealing
        their love, in lying and deceiving; and in lying, deceiving, feigning,
        and continually thinking of others, when the passion that united them
        was so intense that they were both oblivious of everything else but
        their love.
      </p>

      <p>
        He vividly recalled all the constantly recurring instances of inevitable
        necessity for lying and deceit, which were so against his natural bent.
        He recalled particularly vividly the shame he had more than once
        detected in her at this necessity for lying and deceit. And he
        experienced the strange feeling that had sometimes come upon him since
        his secret love for Anna. This was a feeling of loathing for
        something&mdash;whether for Alexey Alexandrovitch, or for himself, or
        for the whole world, he could not have said. But he always drove away
        this strange feeling. Now, too, he shook it off and continued the thread
        of his thoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, she was unhappy before, but proud and at peace; and now she
        cannot be at peace and feel secure in her dignity, though she does not
        show it. Yes, we must put an end to it,&rdquo; he decided.
      </p>

      <p>
        And for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that it was
        essential to put an end to this false position, and the sooner the
        better. &ldquo;Throw up everything, she and I, and hide ourselves
        somewhere alone with our love,&rdquo; he said to himself.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 22</h3>

      <p>
        The rain did not last long, and by the time Vronsky arrived, his
        shaft-horse trotting at full speed and dragging the trace-horses
        galloping through the mud, with their reins hanging loose, the sun had
        peeped out again, the roofs of the summer villas and the old limetrees
        in the gardens on both sides of the principal streets sparkled with wet
        brilliance, and from the twigs came a pleasant drip and from the roofs
        rushing streams of water. He thought no more of the shower spoiling the
        race course, but was rejoicing now that&mdash;thanks to the
        rain&mdash;he would be sure to find her at home and alone, as he knew
        that Alexey Alexandrovitch, who had lately returned from a foreign
        watering place, had not moved from Petersburg.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hoping to find her alone, Vronsky alighted, as he always did, to avoid
        attracting attention, before crossing the bridge, and walked to the
        house. He did not go up the steps to the street door, but went into the
        court.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Has your master come?&rdquo; he asked a gardener.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, sir. The mistress is at home. But will you please go to the
        front door; there are servants there,&rdquo; the gardener answered.
        &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll open the door.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll go in from the garden.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And feeling satisfied that she was alone, and wanting to take her by
        surprise, since he had not promised to be there today, and she would
        certainly not expect him to come before the races, he walked, holding
        his sword and stepping cautiously over the sandy path, bordered with
        flowers, to the terrace that looked out upon the garden. Vronsky forgot
        now all that he had thought on the way of the hardships and difficulties
        of their position. He thought of nothing but that he would see her
        directly, not in imagination, but living, all of her, as she was in
        reality. He was just going in, stepping on his whole foot so as not to
        creak, up the worn steps of the terrace, when he suddenly remembered
        what he always forgot, and what caused the most torturing side of his
        relations with her, her son with his questioning&mdash;hostile, as he
        fancied&mdash;eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        This boy was more often than anyone else a check upon their freedom.
        When he was present, both Vronsky and Anna did not merely avoid speaking
        of anything that they could not have repeated before everyone; they did
        not even allow themselves to refer by hints to anything the boy did not
        understand. They had made no agreement about this, it had settled
        itself. They would have felt it wounding themselves to deceive the
        child. In his presence they talked like acquaintances. But in spite of
        this caution, Vronsky often saw the child&rsquo;s intent, bewildered
        glance fixed upon him, and a strange shyness, uncertainty, at one time
        friendliness, at another, coldness and reserve, in the boy&rsquo;s
        manner to him; as though the child felt that between this man and his
        mother there existed some important bond, the significance of which he
        could not understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a fact, the boy did feel that he could not understand this relation,
        and he tried painfully, and was not able to make clear to himself what
        feeling he ought to have for this man. With a child&rsquo;s keen
        instinct for every manifestation of feeling, he saw distinctly that his
        father, his governess, his nurse,&mdash;all did not merely dislike
        Vronsky, but looked on him with horror and aversion, though they never
        said anything about him, while his mother looked on him as her greatest
        friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What does it mean? Who is he? How ought I to love him? If I
        don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s my fault; either I&rsquo;m stupid or a
        naughty boy,&rdquo; thought the child. And this was what caused his
        dubious, inquiring, sometimes hostile, expression, and the shyness and
        uncertainty which Vronsky found so irksome. This child&rsquo;s presence
        always and infallibly called up in Vronsky that strange feeling of
        inexplicable loathing which he had experienced of late. This
        child&rsquo;s presence called up both in Vronsky and in Anna a feeling
        akin to the feeling of a sailor who sees by the compass that the
        direction in which he is swiftly moving is far from the right one, but
        that to arrest his motion is not in his power, that every instant is
        carrying him further and further away, and that to admit to himself his
        deviation from the right direction is the same as admitting his certain
        ruin.
      </p>

      <p>
        This child, with his innocent outlook upon life, was the compass that
        showed them the point to which they had departed from what they knew,
        but did not want to know.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time Seryozha was not at home, and she was completely alone. She
        was sitting on the terrace waiting for the return of her son, who had
        gone out for his walk and been caught in the rain. She had sent a
        manservant and a maid out to look for him. Dressed in a white gown,
        deeply embroidered, she was sitting in a corner of the terrace behind
        some flowers, and did not hear him. Bending her curly black head, she
        pressed her forehead against a cool watering pot that stood on the
        parapet, and both her lovely hands, with the rings he knew so well,
        clasped the pot. The beauty of her whole figure, her head, her neck, her
        hands, struck Vronsky every time as something new and unexpected. He
        stood still, gazing at her in ecstasy. But, directly he would have made
        a step to come nearer to her, she was aware of his presence, pushed away
        the watering pot, and turned her flushed face towards him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? You are ill?&rdquo; he said to her in
        French, going up to her. He would have run to her, but remembering that
        there might be spectators, he looked round towards the balcony door, and
        reddened a little, as he always reddened, feeling that he had to be
        afraid and be on his guard.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m quite well,&rdquo; she said, getting up and
        pressing his outstretched hand tightly. &ldquo;I did not expect ...
        thee.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mercy! what cold hands!&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You startled me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m alone, and
        expecting Seryozha; he&rsquo;s out for a walk; they&rsquo;ll come in
        from this side.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But, in spite of her efforts to be calm, her lips were quivering.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Forgive me for coming, but I couldn&rsquo;t pass the day without
        seeing you,&rdquo; he went on, speaking French, as he always did to
        avoid using the stiff Russian plural form, so impossibly frigid between
        them, and the dangerously intimate singular.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Forgive you? I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re ill or worried,&rdquo; he went on, not letting
        go her hands and bending over her. &ldquo;What were you thinking
        of?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Always the same thing,&rdquo; she said, with a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        She spoke the truth. If ever at any moment she had been asked what she
        was thinking of, she could have answered truly: of the same thing, of
        her happiness and her unhappiness. She was thinking, just when he came
        upon her, of this: why was it, she wondered, that to others, to Betsy
        (she knew of her secret connection with Tushkevitch) it was all easy,
        while to her it was such torture? Today this thought gained special
        poignancy from certain other considerations. She asked him about the
        races. He answered her questions, and, seeing that she was agitated,
        trying to calm her, he began telling her in the simplest tone the
        details of his preparations for the races.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell him or not tell him?&rdquo; she thought, looking into his
        quiet, affectionate eyes. &ldquo;He is so happy, so absorbed in his
        races that he won&rsquo;t understand as he ought, he won&rsquo;t
        understand all the gravity of this fact to us.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told me what you were thinking of when I
        came in,&rdquo; he said, interrupting his narrative; &ldquo;please tell
        me!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She did not answer, and, bending her head a little, she looked
        inquiringly at him from under her brows, her eyes shining under their
        long lashes. Her hand shook as it played with a leaf she had picked. He
        saw it, and his face expressed that utter subjection, that slavish
        devotion, which had done so much to win her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I see something has happened. Do you suppose I can be at peace,
        knowing you have a trouble I am not sharing? Tell me, for God&rsquo;s
        sake,&rdquo; he repeated imploringly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I shan&rsquo;t be able to forgive him if he does not realize
        all the gravity of it. Better not tell; why put him to the proof?&rdquo;
        she thought, still staring at him in the same way, and feeling the hand
        that held the leaf was trembling more and more.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; he repeated, taking her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall I tell you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with child,&rdquo; she said, softly and deliberately.
        The leaf in her hand shook more violently, but she did not take her eyes
        off him, watching how he would take it. He turned white, would have said
        something, but stopped; he dropped her hand, and his head sank on his
        breast. &ldquo;Yes, he realizes all the gravity of it,&rdquo; she
        thought, and gratefully she pressed his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        But she was mistaken in thinking he realized the gravity of the fact as
        she, a woman, realized it. On hearing it, he felt come upon him with
        tenfold intensity that strange feeling of loathing of someone. But at
        the same time, he felt that the turning-point he had been longing for
        had come now; that it was impossible to go on concealing things from her
        husband, and it was inevitable in one way or another that they should
        soon put an end to their unnatural position. But, besides that, her
        emotion physically affected him in the same way. He looked at her with a
        look of submissive tenderness, kissed her hand, got up, and, in silence,
        paced up and down the terrace.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, going up to her resolutely. &ldquo;Neither
        you nor I have looked on our relations as a passing amusement, and now
        our fate is sealed. It is absolutely necessary to put an
        end&rdquo;&mdash;he looked round as he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;to the
        deception in which we are living.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Put an end? How put an end, Alexey?&rdquo; she said softly.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was calmer now, and her face lighted up with a tender smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Leave your husband and make our life one.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It is one as it is,&rdquo; she answered, scarcely audibly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but altogether; altogether.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But how, Alexey, tell me how?&rdquo; she said in melancholy
        mockery at the hopelessness of her own position. &ldquo;Is there any way
        out of such a position? Am I not the wife of my husband?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There is a way out of every position. We must take our
        line,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Anything&rsquo;s better than the position
        in which you&rsquo;re living. Of course, I see how you torture yourself
        over everything&mdash;the world and your son and your husband.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, not over my husband,&rdquo; she said, with a quiet smile.
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him, I don&rsquo;t think of him. He
        doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not speaking sincerely. I know you. You worry about
        him too.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, he doesn&rsquo;t even know,&rdquo; she said, and suddenly a
        hot flush came over her face; her cheeks, her brow, her neck crimsoned,
        and tears of shame came into her eyes. &ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t talk of
        him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 23</h3>

      <p>
        Vronsky had several times already, though not so resolutely as now,
        tried to bring her to consider their position, and every time he had
        been confronted by the same superficiality and triviality with which she
        met his appeal now. It was as though there were something in this which
        she could not or would not face, as though directly she began to speak
        of this, she, the real Anna, retreated somehow into herself, and another
        strange and unaccountable woman came out, whom he did not love, and whom
        he feared, and who was in opposition to him. But today he was resolved
        to have it out.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Whether he knows or not,&rdquo; said Vronsky, in his usual quiet
        and resolute tone, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s nothing to do with us. We cannot
        ... you cannot stay like this, especially now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done, according to you?&rdquo; she asked with
        the same frivolous irony. She who had so feared he would take her
        condition too lightly was now vexed with him for deducing from it the
        necessity of taking some step.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell him everything, and leave him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, let us suppose I do that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do
        you know what the result of that would be? I can tell you it all
        beforehand,&rdquo; and a wicked light gleamed in her eyes, that had been
        so soft a minute before. &ldquo;&lsquo;Eh, you love another man, and
        have entered into criminal intrigues with him?&rsquo;&rdquo; (Mimicking
        her husband, she threw an emphasis on the word &ldquo;criminal,&rdquo;
        as Alexey Alexandrovitch did.) &ldquo;&lsquo;I warned you of the results
        in the religious, the civil, and the domestic relation. You have not
        listened to me. Now I cannot let you disgrace my
        name,&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;and my son,&rdquo; she had meant to
        say, but about her son she could not jest,&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;disgrace
        my name, and&rsquo;&mdash;and more in the same style,&rdquo; she added.
        &ldquo;In general terms, he&rsquo;ll say in his official manner, and
        with all distinctness and precision, that he cannot let me go, but will
        take all measures in his power to prevent scandal. And he will calmly
        and punctually act in accordance with his words. That&rsquo;s what will
        happen. He&rsquo;s not a man, but a machine, and a spiteful machine when
        he&rsquo;s angry,&rdquo; she added, recalling Alexey Alexandrovitch as
        she spoke, with all the peculiarities of his figure and manner of
        speaking, and reckoning against him every defect she could find in him,
        softening nothing for the great wrong she herself was doing him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But, Anna,&rdquo; said Vronsky, in a soft and persuasive voice,
        trying to soothe her, &ldquo;we absolutely must, anyway, tell him, and
        then be guided by the line he takes.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What, run away?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And why not run away? I don&rsquo;t see how we can keep on like
        this. And not for my sake&mdash;I see that you suffer.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, run away, and become your mistress,&rdquo; she said angrily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna,&rdquo; he said, with reproachful tenderness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;become your mistress, and
        complete the ruin of....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Again she would have said &ldquo;my son,&rdquo; but she could not utter
        that word.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky could not understand how she, with her strong and truthful
        nature, could endure this state of deceit, and not long to get out of
        it. But he did not suspect that the chief cause of it was the
        word&mdash;<i>son</i>, which she could not bring herself to pronounce.
        When she thought of her son, and his future attitude to his mother, who
        had abandoned his father, she felt such terror at what she had done,
        that she could not face it; but, like a woman, could only try to comfort
        herself with lying assurances that everything would remain as it always
        had been, and that it was possible to forget the fearful question of how
        it would be with her son.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I beg you, I entreat you,&rdquo; she said suddenly, taking his
        hand, and speaking in quite a different tone, sincere and tender,
        &ldquo;never speak to me of that!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But, Anna....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Never. Leave it to me. I know all the baseness, all the horror of
        my position; but it&rsquo;s not so easy to arrange as you think. And
        leave it to me, and do what I say. Never speak to me of it. Do you
        promise me?... No, no, promise!...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I promise everything, but I can&rsquo;t be at peace, especially
        after what you have told me. I can&rsquo;t be at peace, when you
        can&rsquo;t be at peace....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Yes, I am worried sometimes; but
        that will pass, if you will never talk about this. When you talk about
        it&mdash;it&rsquo;s only then it worries me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she interrupted him, &ldquo;how hard it is for
        your truthful nature to lie, and I grieve for you. I often think that
        you have ruined your whole life for me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I was just thinking the very same thing,&rdquo; he said;
        &ldquo;how could you sacrifice everything for my sake? I can&rsquo;t
        forgive myself that you&rsquo;re unhappy!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I unhappy?&rdquo; she said, coming closer to him, and looking at
        him with an ecstatic smile of love. &ldquo;I am like a hungry man who
        has been given food. He may be cold, and dressed in rags, and ashamed,
        but he is not unhappy. I unhappy? No, this is my unhappiness....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She could hear the sound of her son&rsquo;s voice coming towards them,
        and glancing swiftly round the terrace, she got up impulsively. Her eyes
        glowed with the fire he knew so well; with a rapid movement she raised
        her lovely hands, covered with rings, took his head, looked a long look
        into his face, and, putting up her face with smiling, parted lips,
        swiftly kissed his mouth and both eyes, and pushed him away. She would
        have gone, but he held her back.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;When?&rdquo; he murmured in a whisper, gazing in ecstasy at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Tonight, at one o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; she whispered, and, with a
        heavy sigh, she walked with her light, swift step to meet her son.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seryozha had been caught by the rain in the big garden, and he and his
        nurse had taken shelter in an arbor.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, <i>au revoir</i>,&rdquo; she said to Vronsky. &ldquo;I must
        soon be getting ready for the races. Betsy promised to fetch me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky, looking at his watch, went away hurriedly.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 24</h3>

      <p>
        When Vronsky looked at his watch on the Karenins&rsquo; balcony, he was
        so greatly agitated and lost in his thoughts that he saw the figures on
        the watch&rsquo;s face, but could not take in what time it was. He came
        out on to the highroad and walked, picking his way carefully through the
        mud, to his carriage. He was so completely absorbed in his feeling for
        Anna, that he did not even think what o&rsquo;clock it was, and whether
        he had time to go to Bryansky&rsquo;s. He had left him, as often
        happens, only the external faculty of memory, that points out each step
        one has to take, one after the other. He went up to his coachman, who
        was dozing on the box in the shadow, already lengthening, of a thick
        limetree; he admired the shifting clouds of midges circling over the hot
        horses, and, waking the coachman, he jumped into the carriage, and told
        him to drive to Bryansky&rsquo;s. It was only after driving nearly five
        miles that he had sufficiently recovered himself to look at his watch,
        and realize that it was half-past five, and he was late.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were several races fixed for that day: the Mounted Guards&rsquo;
        race, then the officers&rsquo; mile-and-a-half race, then the three-mile
        race, and then the race for which he was entered. He could still be in
        time for his race, but if he went to Bryansky&rsquo;s he could only just
        be in time, and he would arrive when the whole of the court would be in
        their places. That would be a pity. But he had promised Bryansky to
        come, and so he decided to drive on, telling the coachman not to spare
        the horses.
      </p>

      <p>
        He reached Bryansky&rsquo;s, spent five minutes there, and galloped
        back. This rapid drive calmed him. All that was painful in his relations
        with Anna, all the feeling of indefiniteness left by their conversation,
        had slipped out of his mind. He was thinking now with pleasure and
        excitement of the race, of his being anyhow, in time, and now and then
        the thought of the blissful interview awaiting him that night flashed
        across his imagination like a flaming light.
      </p>

      <p>
        The excitement of the approaching race gained upon him as he drove
        further and further into the atmosphere of the races, overtaking
        carriages driving up from the summer villas or out of Petersburg.
      </p>

      <p>
        At his quarters no one was left at home; all were at the races, and his
        valet was looking out for him at the gate. While he was changing his
        clothes, his valet told him that the second race had begun already, that
        a lot of gentlemen had been to ask for him, and a boy had twice run up
        from the stables. Dressing without hurry (he never hurried himself, and
        never lost his self-possession), Vronsky drove to the sheds. From the
        sheds he could see a perfect sea of carriages, and people on foot,
        soldiers surrounding the race course, and pavilions swarming with
        people. The second race was apparently going on, for just as he went
        into the sheds he heard a bell ringing. Going towards the stable, he met
        the white-legged chestnut, Mahotin&rsquo;s Gladiator, being led to the
        race-course in a blue forage horsecloth, with what looked like huge ears
        edged with blue.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Cord?&rdquo; he asked the stable-boy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In the stable, putting on the saddle.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        In the open horse-box stood Frou-Frou, saddled ready. They were just
        going to lead her out.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not too late?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All right! All right!&rdquo; said the Englishman;
        &ldquo;don&rsquo;t upset yourself!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky once more took in in one glance the exquisite lines of his
        favorite mare; who was quivering all over, and with an effort he tore
        himself from the sight of her, and went out of the stable. He went
        towards the pavilions at the most favorable moment for escaping
        attention. The mile-and-a-half race was just finishing, and all eyes
        were fixed on the horse-guard in front and the light hussar behind,
        urging their horses on with a last effort close to the winning post.
        From the center and outside of the ring all were crowding to the winning
        post, and a group of soldiers and officers of the horse-guards were
        shouting loudly their delight at the expected triumph of their officer
        and comrade. Vronsky moved into the middle of the crowd unnoticed,
        almost at the very moment when the bell rang at the finish of the race,
        and the tall, mudspattered horse-guard who came in first, bending over
        the saddle, let go the reins of his panting gray horse that looked dark
        with sweat.
      </p>

      <p>
        The horse, stiffening out its legs, with an effort stopped its rapid
        course, and the officer of the horse-guards looked round him like a man
        waking up from a heavy sleep, and just managed to smile. A crowd of
        friends and outsiders pressed round him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky intentionally avoided that select crowd of the upper world,
        which was moving and talking with discreet freedom before the pavilions.
        He knew that Madame Karenina was there, and Betsy, and his
        brother&rsquo;s wife, and he purposely did not go near them for fear of
        something distracting his attention. But he was continually met and
        stopped by acquaintances, who told him about the previous races, and
        kept asking him why he was so late.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the time when the racers had to go to the pavilion to receive the
        prizes, and all attention was directed to that point, Vronsky&rsquo;s
        elder brother, Alexander, a colonel with heavy fringed epaulets, came up
        to him. He was not tall, though as broadly built as Alexey, and
        handsomer and rosier than he; he had a red nose, and an open,
        drunken-looking face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you get my note?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never
        any finding you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexander Vronsky, in spite of the dissolute life, and in especial the
        drunken habits, for which he was notorious, was quite one of the court
        circle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, as he talked to his brother of a matter bound to be exceedingly
        disagreeable to him, knowing that the eyes of many people might be fixed
        upon him, he kept a smiling countenance, as though he were jesting with
        his brother about something of little moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I got it, and I really can&rsquo;t make out what <i>you</i> are
        worrying yourself about,&rdquo; said Alexey.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worrying myself because the remark has just been made
        to me that you weren&rsquo;t here, and that you were seen in Peterhof on
        Monday.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There are matters which only concern those directly interested in
        them, and the matter you are so worried about is....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but if so, you may as well cut the service....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I beg you not to meddle, and that&rsquo;s all I have to
        say.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Vronsky&rsquo;s frowning face turned white, and his prominent
        lower jaw quivered, which happened rarely with him. Being a man of very
        warm heart, he was seldom angry; but when he was angry, and when his
        chin quivered, then, as Alexander Vronsky knew, he was dangerous.
        Alexander Vronsky smiled gaily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I only wanted to give you Mother&rsquo;s letter. Answer it, and
        don&rsquo;t worry about anything just before the race.
        <i>Bonne chance,</i>&rdquo; he added, smiling and he moved away from
        him. But after him another friendly greeting brought Vronsky to a
        standstill.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you won&rsquo;t recognize your friends! How are you,
        <i>mon cher?</i>&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, as conspicuously
        brilliant in the midst of all the Petersburg brilliance as he was in
        Moscow, his face rosy, and his whiskers sleek and glossy. &ldquo;I came
        up yesterday, and I&rsquo;m delighted that I shall see your triumph.
        When shall we meet?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come tomorrow to the messroom,&rdquo; said Vronsky, and squeezing
        him by the sleeve of his coat, with apologies, he moved away to the
        center of the race course, where the horses were being led for the great
        steeplechase.
      </p>

      <p>
        The horses who had run in the last race were being led home, steaming
        and exhausted, by the stable-boys, and one after another the fresh
        horses for the coming race made their appearance, for the most part
        English racers, wearing horsecloths, and looking with their drawn-up
        bellies like strange, huge birds. On the right was led in Frou-Frou,
        lean and beautiful, lifting up her elastic, rather long pasterns, as
        though moved by springs. Not far from her they were taking the rug off
        the lop-eared Gladiator. The strong, exquisite, perfectly correct lines
        of the stallion, with his superb hind-quarters and excessively short
        pasterns almost over his hoofs, attracted Vronsky&rsquo;s attention in
        spite of himself. He would have gone up to his mare, but he was again
        detained by an acquaintance.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s Karenin!&rdquo; said the acquaintance with whom
        he was chatting. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s looking for his wife, and she&rsquo;s
        in the middle of the pavilion. Didn&rsquo;t you see her?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Vronsky, and without even glancing round
        towards the pavilion where his friend was pointing out Madame Karenina,
        he went up to his mare.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky had not had time to look at the saddle, about which he had to
        give some direction, when the competitors were summoned to the pavilion
        to receive their numbers and places in the row at starting. Seventeen
        officers, looking serious and severe, many with pale faces, met together
        in the pavilion and drew the numbers. Vronsky drew the number seven. The
        cry was heard: &ldquo;Mount!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Feeling that with the others riding in the race, he was the center upon
        which all eyes were fastened, Vronsky walked up to his mare in that
        state of nervous tension in which he usually became deliberate and
        composed in his movements. Cord, in honor of the races, had put on his
        best clothes, a black coat buttoned up, a stiffly starched collar, which
        propped up his cheeks, a round black hat, and top boots. He was calm and
        dignified as ever, and was with his own hands holding Frou-Frou by both
        reins, standing straight in front of her. Frou-Frou was still trembling
        as though in a fever. Her eye, full of fire, glanced sideways at
        Vronsky. Vronsky slipped his finger under the saddle-girth. The mare
        glanced aslant at him, drew up her lip, and twitched her ear. The
        Englishman puckered up his lips, intending to indicate a smile that
        anyone should verify his saddling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Get up; you won&rsquo;t feel so excited.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky looked round for the last time at his rivals. He knew that he
        would not see them during the race. Two were already riding forward to
        the point from which they were to start. Galtsin, a friend of
        Vronsky&rsquo;s and one of his more formidable rivals, was moving round
        a bay horse that would not let him mount. A little light hussar in tight
        riding breeches rode off at a gallop, crouched up like a cat on the
        saddle, in imitation of English jockeys. Prince Kuzovlev sat with a
        white face on his thoroughbred mare from the Grabovsky stud, while an
        English groom led her by the bridle. Vronsky and all his comrades knew
        Kuzovlev and his peculiarity of &ldquo;weak nerves&rdquo; and terrible
        vanity. They knew that he was afraid of everything, afraid of riding a
        spirited horse. But now, just because it was terrible, because people
        broke their necks, and there was a doctor standing at each obstacle, and
        an ambulance with a cross on it, and a sister of mercy, he had made up
        his mind to take part in the race. Their eyes met, and Vronsky gave him
        a friendly and encouraging nod. Only one he did not see, his chief
        rival, Mahotin on Gladiator.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry,&rdquo; said Cord to Vronsky,
        &ldquo;and remember one thing: don&rsquo;t hold her in at the fences,
        and don&rsquo;t urge her on; let her go as she likes.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo; said Vronsky, taking the reins.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you can, lead the race; but don&rsquo;t lose heart till the
        last minute, even if you&rsquo;re behind.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Before the mare had time to move, Vronsky stepped with an agile,
        vigorous movement into the steel-toothed stirrup, and lightly and firmly
        seated himself on the creaking leather of the saddle. Getting his right
        foot in the stirrup, he smoothed the double reins, as he always did,
        between his fingers, and Cord let go.
      </p>

      <p>
        As though she did not know which foot to put first, Frou-Frou started,
        dragging at the reins with her long neck, and as though she were on
        springs, shaking her rider from side to side. Cord quickened his step,
        following him. The excited mare, trying to shake off her rider first on
        one side and then the other, pulled at the reins, and Vronsky tried in
        vain with voice and hand to soothe her.
      </p>

      <p>
        They were just reaching the dammed-up stream on their way to the
        starting point. Several of the riders were in front and several behind,
        when suddenly Vronsky heard the sound of a horse galloping in the mud
        behind him, and he was overtaken by Mahotin on his white-legged,
        lop-eared Gladiator. Mahotin smiled, showing his long teeth, but Vronsky
        looked angrily at him. He did not like him, and regarded him now as his
        most formidable rival. He was angry with him for galloping past and
        exciting his mare. Frou-Frou started into a gallop, her left foot
        forward, made two bounds, and fretting at the tightened reins, passed
        into a jolting trot, bumping her rider up and down. Cord, too, scowled,
        and followed Vronsky almost at a trot.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 25</h3>

      <p>
        There were seventeen officers in all riding in this race. The race
        course was a large three-mile ring of the form of an ellipse in front of
        the pavilion. On this course nine obstacles had been arranged: the
        stream, a big and solid barrier five feet high, just before the
        pavilion, a dry ditch, a ditch full of water, a precipitous slope, an
        Irish barricade (one of the most difficult obstacles, consisting of a
        mound fenced with brushwood, beyond which was a ditch out of sight for
        the horses, so that the horse had to clear both obstacles or might be
        killed); then two more ditches filled with water, and one dry one; and
        the end of the race was just facing the pavilion. But the race began not
        in the ring, but two hundred yards away from it, and in that part of the
        course was the first obstacle, a dammed-up stream, seven feet in
        breadth, which the racers could leap or wade through as they preferred.
      </p>

      <p>
        Three times they were ranged ready to start, but each time some horse
        thrust itself out of line, and they had to begin again. The umpire who
        was starting them, Colonel Sestrin, was beginning to lose his temper,
        when at last for the fourth time he shouted &ldquo;Away!&rdquo; and the
        racers started.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every eye, every opera-glass, was turned on the brightly colored group
        of riders at the moment they were in line to start.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They&rsquo;re off! They&rsquo;re starting!&rdquo; was heard on
        all sides after the hush of expectation.
      </p>

      <p>
        And little groups and solitary figures among the public began running
        from place to place to get a better view. In the very first minute the
        close group of horsemen drew out, and it could be seen that they were
        approaching the stream in twos and threes and one behind another. To the
        spectators it seemed as though they had all started simultaneously, but
        to the racers there were seconds of difference that had great value to
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Frou-Frou, excited and over-nervous, had lost the first moment, and
        several horses had started before her, but before reaching the stream,
        Vronsky, who was holding in the mare with all his force as she tugged at
        the bridle, easily overtook three, and there were left in front of him
        Mahotin&rsquo;s chestnut Gladiator, whose hind-quarters were moving
        lightly and rhythmically up and down exactly in front of Vronsky, and in
        front of all, the dainty mare Diana bearing Kuzovlev more dead than
        alive.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the first instant Vronsky was not master either of himself or his
        mare. Up to the first obstacle, the stream, he could not guide the
        motions of his mare.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gladiator and Diana came up to it together and almost at the same
        instant; simultaneously they rose above the stream and flew across to
        the other side; Frou-Frou darted after them, as if flying; but at the
        very moment when Vronsky felt himself in the air, he suddenly saw almost
        under his mare&rsquo;s hoofs Kuzovlev, who was floundering with Diana on
        the further side of the stream. (Kuzovlev had let go the reins as he
        took the leap, and the mare had sent him flying over her head.) Those
        details Vronsky learned later; at the moment all he saw was that just
        under him, where Frou-Frou must alight, Diana&rsquo;s legs or head might
        be in the way. But Frou-Frou drew up her legs and back in the very act
        of leaping, like a falling cat, and, clearing the other mare, alighted
        beyond her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;O the darling!&rdquo; thought Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        After crossing the stream Vronsky had complete control of his mare, and
        began holding her in, intending to cross the great barrier behind
        Mahotin, and to try to overtake him in the clear ground of about five
        hundred yards that followed it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The great barrier stood just in front of the imperial pavilion. The Tsar
        and the whole court and crowds of people were all gazing at
        them&mdash;at him, and Mahotin a length ahead of him, as they drew near
        the &ldquo;devil,&rdquo; as the solid barrier was called. Vronsky was
        aware of those eyes fastened upon him from all sides, but he saw nothing
        except the ears and neck of his own mare, the ground racing to meet him,
        and the back and white legs of Gladiator beating time swiftly before
        him, and keeping always the same distance ahead. Gladiator rose, with no
        sound of knocking against anything. With a wave of his short tail he
        disappeared from Vronsky&rsquo;s sight.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried a voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same instant, under Vronsky&rsquo;s eyes, right before him
        flashed the palings of the barrier. Without the slightest change in her
        action his mare flew over it; the palings vanished, and he heard only a
        crash behind him. The mare, excited by Gladiator&rsquo;s keeping ahead,
        had risen too soon before the barrier, and grazed it with her hind
        hoofs. But her pace never changed, and Vronsky, feeling a spatter of mud
        in his face, realized that he was once more the same distance from
        Gladiator. Once more he perceived in front of him the same back and
        short tail, and again the same swiftly moving white legs that got no
        further away.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the very moment when Vronsky thought that now was the time to
        overtake Mahotin, Frou-Frou herself, understanding his thoughts, without
        any incitement on his part, gained ground considerably, and began
        getting alongside of Mahotin on the most favorable side, close to the
        inner cord. Mahotin would not let her pass that side. Vronsky had hardly
        formed the thought that he could perhaps pass on the outer side, when
        Frou-Frou shifted her pace and began overtaking him on the other side.
        Frou-Frou&rsquo;s shoulder, beginning by now to be dark with sweat, was
        even with Gladiator&rsquo;s back. For a few lengths they moved evenly.
        But before the obstacle they were approaching, Vronsky began working at
        the reins, anxious to avoid having to take the outer circle, and swiftly
        passed Mahotin just upon the declivity. He caught a glimpse of his
        mud-stained face as he flashed by. He even fancied that he smiled.
        Vronsky passed Mahotin, but he was immediately aware of him close upon
        him, and he never ceased hearing the even-thudding hoofs and the rapid
        and still quite fresh breathing of Gladiator.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next two obstacles, the water course and the barrier, were easily
        crossed, but Vronsky began to hear the snorting and thud of Gladiator
        closer upon him. He urged on his mare, and to his delight felt that she
        easily quickened her pace, and the thud of Gladiator&rsquo;s hoofs was
        again heard at the same distance away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky was at the head of the race, just as he wanted to be and as Cord
        had advised, and now he felt sure of being the winner. His excitement,
        his delight, and his tenderness for Frou-Frou grew keener and keener. He
        longed to look round again, but he did not dare do this, and tried to be
        cool and not to urge on his mare so to keep the same reserve of force in
        her as he felt that Gladiator still kept. There remained only one
        obstacle, the most difficult; if he could cross it ahead of the others
        he would come in first. He was flying towards the Irish barricade,
        Frou-Frou and he both together saw the barricade in the distance, and
        both the man and the mare had a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. He saw the
        uncertainty in the mare&rsquo;s ears and lifted the whip, but at the
        same time felt that his fears were groundless; the mare knew what was
        wanted. She quickened her pace and rose smoothly, just as he had fancied
        she would, and as she left the ground gave herself up to the force of
        her rush, which carried her far beyond the ditch; and with the same
        rhythm, without effort, with the same leg forward, Frou-Frou fell back
        into her pace again.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Bravo, Vronsky!&rdquo; he heard shouts from a knot of
        men&mdash;he knew they were his friends in the regiment&mdash;who were
        standing at the obstacle. He could not fail to recognize Yashvin&rsquo;s
        voice though he did not see him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;O my sweet!&rdquo; he said inwardly to Frou-Frou, as he listened
        for what was happening behind. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s cleared it!&rdquo; he
        thought, catching the thud of Gladiator&rsquo;s hoofs behind him. There
        remained only the last ditch, filled with water and five feet wide.
        Vronsky did not even look at it, but anxious to get in a long way first
        began sawing away at the reins, lifting the mare&rsquo;s head and
        letting it go in time with her paces. He felt that the mare was at her
        very last reserve of strength; not her neck and shoulders merely were
        wet, but the sweat was standing in drops on her mane, her head, her
        sharp ears, and her breath came in short, sharp gasps. But he knew that
        she had strength left more than enough for the remaining five hundred
        yards. It was only from feeling himself nearer the ground and from the
        peculiar smoothness of his motion that Vronsky knew how greatly the mare
        had quickened her pace. She flew over the ditch as though not noticing
        it. She flew over it like a bird; but at the same instant Vronsky, to
        his horror, felt that he had failed to keep up with the mare&rsquo;s
        pace, that he had, he did not know how, made a fearful, unpardonable
        mistake, in recovering his seat in the saddle. All at once his position
        had shifted and he knew that something awful had happened. He could not
        yet make out what had happened, when the white legs of a chestnut horse
        flashed by close to him, and Mahotin passed at a swift gallop. Vronsky
        was touching the ground with one foot, and his mare was sinking on that
        foot. He just had time to free his leg when she fell on one side,
        gasping painfully, and, making vain efforts to rise with her delicate,
        soaking neck, she fluttered on the ground at his feet like a shot bird.
        The clumsy movement made by Vronsky had broken her back. But that he
        only knew much later. At that moment he knew only that Mahotin had flown
        swiftly by, while he stood staggering alone on the muddy, motionless
        ground, and Frou-Frou lay gasping before him, bending her head back and
        gazing at him with her exquisite eyes. Still unable to realize what had
        happened, Vronsky tugged at his mare&rsquo;s reins. Again she struggled
        all over like a fish, and her shoulders setting the saddle heaving, she
        rose on her front legs but unable to lift her back, she quivered all
        over and again fell on her side. With a face hideous with passion, his
        lower jaw trembling, and his cheeks white, Vronsky kicked her with his
        heel in the stomach and again fell to tugging at the rein. She did not
        stir, but thrusting her nose into the ground, she simply gazed at her
        master with her speaking eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A&mdash;a&mdash;a!&rdquo; groaned Vronsky, clutching at his head.
        &ldquo;Ah! what have I done!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The race lost! And
        my fault! shameful, unpardonable! And the poor darling, ruined mare! Ah!
        what have I done!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        A crowd of men, a doctor and his assistant, the officers of his
        regiment, ran up to him. To his misery he felt that he was whole and
        unhurt. The mare had broken her back, and it was decided to shoot her.
        Vronsky could not answer questions, could not speak to anyone. He
        turned, and without picking up his cap that had fallen off, walked away
        from the race course, not knowing where he was going. He felt utterly
        wretched. For the first time in his life he knew the bitterest sort of
        misfortune, misfortune beyond remedy, and caused by his own fault.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yashvin overtook him with his cap, and led him home, and half an hour
        later Vronsky had regained his self-possession. But the memory of that
        race remained for long in his heart, the cruelest and bitterest memory
        of his life.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 26</h3>

      <p>
        The external relations of Alexey Alexandrovitch and his wife had
        remained unchanged. The sole difference lay in the fact that he was more
        busily occupied than ever. As in former years, at the beginning of the
        spring he had gone to a foreign watering-place for the sake of his
        health, deranged by the winter&rsquo;s work that every year grew
        heavier. And just as always he returned in July and at once fell to work
        as usual with increased energy. As usual, too, his wife had moved for
        the summer to a villa out of town, while he remained in Petersburg. From
        the date of their conversation after the party at Princess
        Tverskaya&rsquo;s he had never spoken again to Anna of his suspicions
        and his jealousies, and that habitual tone of his bantering mimicry was
        the most convenient tone possible for his present attitude to his wife.
        He was a little colder to his wife. He simply seemed to be slightly
        displeased with her for that first midnight conversation, which she had
        repelled. In his attitude to her there was a shade of vexation, but
        nothing more. &ldquo;You would not be open with me,&rdquo; he seemed to
        say, mentally addressing her; &ldquo;so much the worse for you. Now you
        may beg as you please, but I won&rsquo;t be open with you. So much the
        worse for you!&rdquo; he said mentally, like a man who, after vainly
        attempting to extinguish a fire, should fly in a rage with his vain
        efforts and say, &ldquo;Oh, very well then! you shall burn for
        this!&rdquo; This man, so subtle and astute in official life, did not
        realize all the senselessness of such an attitude to his wife. He did
        not realize it, because it was too terrible to him to realize his actual
        position, and he shut down and locked and sealed up in his heart that
        secret place where lay hid his feelings towards his family, that is, his
        wife and son. He who had been such a careful father, had from the end of
        that winter become peculiarly frigid to his son, and adopted to him just
        the same bantering tone he used with his wife. &ldquo;Aha, young
        man!&rdquo; was the greeting with which he met him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch asserted and believed that he had never in any
        previous year had so much official business as that year. But he was not
        aware that he sought work for himself that year, that this was one of
        the means for keeping shut that secret place where lay hid his feelings
        towards his wife and son and his thoughts about them, which became more
        terrible the longer they lay there. If anyone had had the right to ask
        Alexey Alexandrovitch what he thought of his wife&rsquo;s behavior, the
        mild and peaceable Alexey Alexandrovitch would have made no answer, but
        he would have been greatly angered with any man who should question him
        on that subject. For this reason there positively came into Alexey
        Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s face a look of haughtiness and severity whenever
        anyone inquired after his wife&rsquo;s health. Alexey Alexandrovitch did
        not want to think at all about his wife&rsquo;s behavior, and he
        actually succeeded in not thinking about it at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s permanent summer villa was in Peterhof,
        and the Countess Lidia Ivanovna used as a rule to spend the summer
        there, close to Anna, and constantly seeing her. That year Countess
        Lidia Ivanovna declined to settle in Peterhof, was not once at Anna
        Arkadyevna&rsquo;s, and in conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch
        hinted at the unsuitability of Anna&rsquo;s close intimacy with Betsy
        and Vronsky. Alexey Alexandrovitch sternly cut her short, roundly
        declaring his wife to be above suspicion, and from that time began to
        avoid Countess Lidia Ivanovna. He did not want to see, and did not see,
        that many people in society cast dubious glances on his wife; he did not
        want to understand, and did not understand, why his wife had so
        particularly insisted on staying at Tsarskoe, where Betsy was staying,
        and not far from the camp of Vronsky&rsquo;s regiment. He did not allow
        himself to think about it, and he did not think about it; but all the
        same though he never admitted it to himself, and had no proofs, not even
        suspicious evidence, in the bottom of his heart he knew beyond all doubt
        that he was a deceived husband, and he was profoundly miserable about
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        How often during those eight years of happy life with his wife Alexey
        Alexandrovitch had looked at other men&rsquo;s faithless wives and other
        deceived husbands and asked himself: &ldquo;How can people descend to
        that? how is it they don&rsquo;t put an end to such a hideous
        position?&rdquo; But now, when the misfortune had come upon himself, he
        was so far from thinking of putting an end to the position that he would
        not recognize it at all, would not recognize it just because it was too
        awful, too unnatural.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since his return from abroad Alexey Alexandrovitch had twice been at
        their country villa. Once he dined there, another time he spent the
        evening there with a party of friends, but he had not once stayed the
        night there, as it had been his habit to do in previous years.
      </p>

      <p>
        The day of the races had been a very busy day for Alexey Alexandrovitch;
        but when mentally sketching out the day in the morning, he made up his
        mind to go to their country house to see his wife immediately after
        dinner, and from there to the races, which all the Court were to
        witness, and at which he was bound to be present. He was going to see
        his wife, because he had determined to see her once a week to keep up
        appearances. And besides, on that day, as it was the fifteenth, he had
        to give his wife some money for her expenses, according to their usual
        arrangement.
      </p>

      <p>
        With his habitual control over his thoughts, though he thought all this
        about his wife, he did not let his thoughts stray further in regard to
        her.
      </p>

      <p>
        That morning was a very full one for Alexey Alexandrovitch. The evening
        before, Countess Lidia Ivanovna had sent him a pamphlet by a celebrated
        traveler in China, who was staying in Petersburg, and with it she
        enclosed a note begging him to see the traveler himself, as he was an
        extremely interesting person from various points of view, and likely to
        be useful. Alexey Alexandrovitch had not had time to read the pamphlet
        through in the evening, and finished it in the morning. Then people
        began arriving with petitions, and there came the reports, interviews,
        appointments, dismissals, apportionment of rewards, pensions, grants,
        notes, the workaday round, as Alexey Alexandrovitch called it, that
        always took up so much time. Then there was private business of his own,
        a visit from the doctor and the steward who managed his property. The
        steward did not take up much time. He simply gave Alexey Alexandrovitch
        the money he needed together with a brief statement of the position of
        his affairs, which was not altogether satisfactory, as it had happened
        that during that year, owing to increased expenses, more had been paid
        out than usual, and there was a deficit. But the doctor, a celebrated
        Petersburg doctor, who was an intimate acquaintance of Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, took up a great deal of time. Alexey Alexandrovitch had
        not expected him that day, and was surprised at his visit, and still
        more so when the doctor questioned him very carefully about his health,
        listened to his breathing, and tapped at his liver. Alexey
        Alexandrovitch did not know that his friend Lidia Ivanovna, noticing
        that he was not as well as usual that year, had begged the doctor to go
        and examine him. &ldquo;Do this for my sake,&rdquo; the Countess Lidia
        Ivanovna had said to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I will do it for the sake of Russia, countess,&rdquo; replied the
        doctor.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A priceless man!&rdquo; said the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        The doctor was extremely dissatisfied with Alexey Alexandrovitch. He
        found the liver considerably enlarged, and the digestive powers
        weakened, while the course of mineral waters had been quite without
        effect. He prescribed more physical exercise as far as possible, and as
        far as possible less mental strain, and above all no worry&mdash;in
        other words, just what was as much out of Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s
        power as abstaining from breathing. Then he withdrew, leaving in Alexey
        Alexandrovitch an unpleasant sense that something was wrong with him,
        and that there was no chance of curing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he was coming away, the doctor chanced to meet on the staircase an
        acquaintance of his, Sludin, who was secretary of Alexey
        Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s department. They had been comrades at the
        university, and though they rarely met, they thought highly of each
        other and were excellent friends, and so there was no one to whom the
        doctor would have given his opinion of a patient so freely as to Sludin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How glad I am you&rsquo;ve been seeing him!&rdquo; said Sludin.
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not well, and I fancy.... Well, what do you think of
        him?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said the doctor, beckoning over
        Sludin&rsquo;s head to his coachman to bring the carriage round.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just this,&rdquo; said the doctor, taking a finger of
        his kid glove in his white hands and pulling it, &ldquo;if you
        don&rsquo;t strain the strings, and then try to break them, you&rsquo;ll
        find it a difficult job; but strain a string to its very utmost, and the
        mere weight of one finger on the strained string will snap it. And with
        his close assiduity, his conscientious devotion to his work, he&rsquo;s
        strained to the utmost; and there&rsquo;s some outside burden weighing
        on him, and not a light one,&rdquo; concluded the doctor, raising his
        eyebrows significantly. &ldquo;Will you be at the races?&rdquo; he
        added, as he sank into his seat in the carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, to be sure; it does waste a lot of time,&rdquo; the
        doctor responded vaguely to some reply of Sludin&rsquo;s he had not
        caught.
      </p>

      <p>
        Directly after the doctor, who had taken up so much time, came the
        celebrated traveler, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, by means of the pamphlet
        he had only just finished reading and his previous acquaintance with the
        subject, impressed the traveler by the depth of his knowledge of the
        subject and the breadth and enlightenment of his view of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time as the traveler there was announced a provincial
        marshal of nobility on a visit to Petersburg, with whom Alexey
        Alexandrovitch had to have some conversation. After his departure, he
        had to finish the daily routine of business with his secretary, and then
        he still had to drive round to call on a certain great personage on a
        matter of grave and serious import. Alexey Alexandrovitch only just
        managed to be back by five o&rsquo;clock, his dinner-hour, and after
        dining with his secretary, he invited him to drive with him to his
        country villa and to the races.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though he did not acknowledge it to himself, Alexey Alexandrovitch
        always tried nowadays to secure the presence of a third person in his
        interviews with his wife.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 27</h3>

      <p>
        Anna was upstairs, standing before the looking-glass, and, with
        Annushka&rsquo;s assistance, pinning the last ribbon on her gown when
        she heard carriage wheels crunching the gravel at the entrance.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early for Betsy,&rdquo; she thought, and glancing
        out of the window she caught sight of the carriage and the black hat of
        Alexey Alexandrovitch, and the ears that she knew so well sticking up
        each side of it. &ldquo;How unlucky! Can he be going to stay the
        night?&rdquo; she wondered, and the thought of all that might come of
        such a chance struck her as so awful and terrible that, without dwelling
        on it for a moment, she went down to meet him with a bright and radiant
        face; and conscious of the presence of that spirit of falsehood and
        deceit in herself that she had come to know of late, she abandoned
        herself to that spirit and began talking, hardly knowing what she was
        saying.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, how nice of you!&rdquo; she said, giving her husband her
        hand, and greeting Sludin, who was like one of the family, with a smile.
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re staying the night, I hope?&rdquo; was the first word
        the spirit of falsehood prompted her to utter; &ldquo;and now
        we&rsquo;ll go together. Only it&rsquo;s a pity I&rsquo;ve promised
        Betsy. She&rsquo;s coming for me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch knit his brows at Betsy&rsquo;s name.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not going to separate the inseparables,&rdquo; he
        said in his usual bantering tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with Mihail
        Vassilievitch. I&rsquo;m ordered exercise by the doctors too. I&rsquo;ll
        walk, and fancy myself at the springs again.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hurry,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;Would you like
        tea?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She rang.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Bring in tea, and tell Seryozha that Alexey Alexandrovitch is
        here. Well, tell me, how have you been? Mihail Vassilievitch,
        you&rsquo;ve not been to see me before. Look how lovely it is out on the
        terrace,&rdquo; she said, turning first to one and then to the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        She spoke very simply and naturally, but too much and too fast. She was
        the more aware of this from noticing in the inquisitive look Mihail
        Vassilievitch turned on her that he was, as it were, keeping watch on
        her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mihail Vassilievitch promptly went out on the terrace.
      </p>

      <p>
        She sat down beside her husband.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look quite well,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the doctor&rsquo;s been with me today
        and wasted an hour of my time. I feel that someone of our friends must
        have sent him: my health&rsquo;s so precious, it seems.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; what did he say?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She questioned him about his health and what he had been doing, and
        tried to persuade him to take a rest and come out to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        All this she said brightly, rapidly, and with a peculiar brilliance in
        her eyes. But Alexey Alexandrovitch did not now attach any special
        significance to this tone of hers. He heard only her words and gave them
        only the direct sense they bore. And he answered simply, though
        jestingly. There was nothing remarkable in all this conversation, but
        never after could Anna recall this brief scene without an agonizing pang
        of shame.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seryozha came in preceded by his governess. If Alexey Alexandrovitch had
        allowed himself to observe he would have noticed the timid and
        bewildered eyes with which Seryozha glanced first at his father and then
        at his mother. But he would not see anything, and he did not see it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, the young man! He&rsquo;s grown. Really, he&rsquo;s getting
        quite a man. How are you, young man?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he gave his hand to the scared child. Seryozha had been shy of his
        father before, and now, ever since Alexey Alexandrovitch had taken to
        calling him young man, and since that insoluble question had occurred to
        him whether Vronsky were a friend or a foe, he avoided his father. He
        looked round towards his mother as though seeking shelter. It was only
        with his mother that he was at ease. Meanwhile, Alexey Alexandrovitch
        was holding his son by the shoulder while he was speaking to the
        governess, and Seryozha was so miserably uncomfortable that Anna saw he
        was on the point of tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna, who had flushed a little the instant her son came in, noticing
        that Seryozha was uncomfortable, got up hurriedly, took Alexey
        Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s hand from her son&rsquo;s shoulder, and kissing
        the boy, led him out onto the terrace, and quickly came back.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to start, though,&rdquo; said she, glancing at
        her watch. &ldquo;How is it Betsy doesn&rsquo;t come?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch, and getting up, he folded
        his hands and cracked his fingers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to bring you
        some money, too, for nightingales, we know, can&rsquo;t live on fairy
        tales,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You want it, I expect?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t ... yes, I do,&rdquo; she said, not looking at
        him, and crimsoning to the roots of her hair. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll
        come back here after the races, I suppose?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; answered Alexey Alexandrovitch. &ldquo;And
        here&rsquo;s the glory of Peterhof, Princess Tverskaya,&rdquo; he added,
        looking out of the window at the elegant English carriage with the tiny
        seats placed extremely high. &ldquo;What elegance! Charming! Well, let
        us be starting too, then.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Princess Tverskaya did not get out of her carriage, but her groom, in
        high boots, a cape, and black hat, darted out at the entrance.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going; good-bye!&rdquo; said Anna, and kissing her son,
        she went up to Alexey Alexandrovitch and held out her hand to him.
        &ldquo;It was ever so nice of you to come.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch kissed her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, <i>au revoir</i>, then! You&rsquo;ll come back for some
        tea; that&rsquo;s delightful!&rdquo; she said, and went out, gay and
        radiant. But as soon as she no longer saw him, she was aware of the spot
        on her hand that his lips had touched, and she shuddered with repulsion.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 28</h3>

      <p>
        When Alexey Alexandrovitch reached the race-course, Anna was already
        sitting in the pavilion beside Betsy, in that pavilion where all the
        highest society had gathered. She caught sight of her husband in the
        distance. Two men, her husband and her lover, were the two centers of
        her existence, and unaided by her external senses she was aware of their
        nearness. She was aware of her husband approaching a long way off, and
        she could not help following him in the surging crowd in the midst of
        which he was moving. She watched his progress towards the pavilion, saw
        him now responding condescendingly to an ingratiating bow, now
        exchanging friendly, nonchalant greetings with his equals, now
        assiduously trying to catch the eye of some great one of this world, and
        taking off his big round hat that squeezed the tips of his ears. All
        these ways of his she knew, and all were hateful to her. &ldquo;Nothing
        but ambition, nothing but the desire to get on, that&rsquo;s all there
        is in his soul,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;as for these lofty ideals,
        love of culture, religion, they are only so many tools for getting
        on.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        From his glances towards the ladies&rsquo; pavilion (he was staring
        straight at her, but did not distinguish his wife in the sea of muslin,
        ribbons, feathers, parasols and flowers) she saw that he was looking for
        her, but she purposely avoided noticing him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey Alexandrovitch!&rdquo; Princess Betsy called to him;
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t see your wife: here she is.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He smiled his chilly smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much splendor here that one&rsquo;s eyes are
        dazzled,&rdquo; he said, and he went into the pavilion. He smiled to his
        wife as a man should smile on meeting his wife after only just parting
        from her, and greeted the princess and other acquaintances, giving to
        each what was due&mdash;that is to say, jesting with the ladies and
        dealing out friendly greetings among the men. Below, near the pavilion,
        was standing an adjutant-general of whom Alexey Alexandrovitch had a
        high opinion, noted for his intelligence and culture. Alexey
        Alexandrovitch entered into conversation with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was an interval between the races, and so nothing hindered
        conversation. The adjutant-general expressed his disapproval of races.
        Alexey Alexandrovitch replied defending them. Anna heard his high,
        measured tones, not losing one word, and every word struck her as false,
        and stabbed her ears with pain.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the three-mile steeplechase was beginning, she bent forward and
        gazed with fixed eyes at Vronsky as he went up to his horse and mounted,
        and at the same time she heard that loathsome, never-ceasing voice of
        her husband. She was in an agony of terror for Vronsky, but a still
        greater agony was the never-ceasing, as it seemed to her, stream of her
        husband&rsquo;s shrill voice with its familiar intonations.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a wicked woman, a lost woman,&rdquo; she thought;
        &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t like lying, I can&rsquo;t endure falsehood,
        while as for <i>him</i>
        (her husband) it&rsquo;s the breath of his life&mdash;falsehood. He
        knows all about it, he sees it all; what does he care if he can talk so
        calmly? If he were to kill me, if he were to kill Vronsky, I might
        respect him. No, all he wants is falsehood and propriety,&rdquo; Anna
        said to herself, not considering exactly what it was she wanted of her
        husband, and how she would have liked to see him behave. She did not
        understand either that Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s peculiar loquacity
        that day, so exasperating to her, was merely the expression of his
        inward distress and uneasiness. As a child that has been hurt skips
        about, putting all his muscles into movement to drown the pain, in the
        same way Alexey Alexandrovitch needed mental exercise to drown the
        thoughts of his wife that in her presence and in Vronsky&rsquo;s, and
        with the continual iteration of his name, would force themselves on his
        attention. And it was as natural for him to talk well and cleverly, as
        it is natural for a child to skip about. He was saying:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Danger in the races of officers, of cavalry men, is an essential
        element in the race. If England can point to the most brilliant feats of
        cavalry in military history, it is simply owing to the fact that she has
        historically developed this force both in beasts and in men. Sport has,
        in my opinion, a great value, and as is always the case, we see nothing
        but what is most superficial.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not superficial,&rdquo; said Princess Tverskaya.
        &ldquo;One of the officers, they say, has broken two ribs.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled his smile, which uncovered his teeth, but
        revealed nothing more.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll admit, princess, that that&rsquo;s not
        superficial,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but internal. But that&rsquo;s not
        the point,&rdquo; and he turned again to the general with whom he was
        talking seriously; &ldquo;we mustn&rsquo;t forget that those who are
        taking part in the race are military men, who have chosen that career,
        and one must allow that every calling has its disagreeable side. It
        forms an integral part of the duties of an officer. Low sports, such as
        prize-fighting or Spanish bull-fights, are a sign of barbarity. But
        specialized trials of skill are a sign of development.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t come another time; it&rsquo;s too
        upsetting,&rdquo; said Princess Betsy. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it,
        Anna?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It is upsetting, but one can&rsquo;t tear oneself away,&rdquo;
        said another lady. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d been a Roman woman I should never
        have missed a single circus.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna said nothing, and keeping her opera-glass up, gazed always at the
        same spot.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment a tall general walked through the pavilion. Breaking off
        what he was saying, Alexey Alexandrovitch got up hurriedly, though with
        dignity, and bowed low to the general.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not racing?&rdquo; the officer asked, chaffing him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My race is a harder one,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch responded
        deferentially.
      </p>

      <p>
        And though the answer meant nothing, the general looked as though he had
        heard a witty remark from a witty man, and fully relished
        <i>la pointe de la sauce</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There are two aspects,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch resumed:
        &ldquo;those who take part and those who look on; and love for such
        spectacles is an unmistakable proof of a low degree of development in
        the spectator, I admit, but....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Princess, bets!&rdquo; sounded Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s voice
        from below, addressing Betsy. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your favorite?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna and I are for Kuzovlev,&rdquo; replied Betsy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for Vronsky. A pair of gloves?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Done!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But it is a pretty sight, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch paused while there was talking about him, but he
        began again directly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I admit that manly sports do not....&rdquo; he was continuing.
      </p>

      <p>
        But at that moment the racers started, and all conversation ceased.
        Alexey Alexandrovitch too was silent, and everyone stood up and turned
        towards the stream. Alexey Alexandrovitch took no interest in the race,
        and so he did not watch the racers, but fell listlessly to scanning the
        spectators with his weary eyes. His eyes rested upon Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her face was white and set. She was obviously seeing nothing and no one
        but one man. Her hand had convulsively clutched her fan, and she held
        her breath. He looked at her and hastily turned away, scrutinizing other
        faces.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But here&rsquo;s this lady too, and others very much moved as
        well; it&rsquo;s very natural,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch told
        himself. He tried not to look at her, but unconsciously his eyes were
        drawn to her. He examined that face again, trying not to read what was
        so plainly written on it, and against his own will, with horror read on
        it what he did not want to know.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first fall&mdash;Kuzovlev&rsquo;s, at the stream&mdash;agitated
        everyone, but Alexey Alexandrovitch saw distinctly on Anna&rsquo;s pale,
        triumphant face that the man she was watching had not fallen. When,
        after Mahotin and Vronsky had cleared the worst barrier, the next
        officer had been thrown straight on his head at it and fatally injured,
        and a shudder of horror passed over the whole public, Alexey
        Alexandrovitch saw that Anna did not even notice it, and had some
        difficulty in realizing what they were talking of about her. But more
        and more often, and with greater persistence, he watched her. Anna,
        wholly engrossed as she was with the race, became aware of her
        husband&rsquo;s cold eyes fixed upon her from one side.
      </p>

      <p>
        She glanced round for an instant, looked inquiringly at him, and with a
        slight frown turned away again.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; she seemed to say to him, and she
        did not once glance at him again.
      </p>

      <p>
        The race was an unlucky one, and of the seventeen officers who rode in
        it more than half were thrown and hurt. Towards the end of the race
        everyone was in a state of agitation, which was intensified by the fact
        that the Tsar was displeased.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 29</h3>

      <p>
        Everyone was loudly expressing disapprobation, everyone was repeating a
        phrase someone had uttered&mdash;&ldquo;The lions and gladiators will be
        the next thing,&rdquo; and everyone was feeling horrified; so that when
        Vronsky fell to the ground, and Anna moaned aloud, there was nothing
        very out of the way in it. But afterwards a change came over
        Anna&rsquo;s face which really was beyond decorum. She utterly lost her
        head. She began fluttering like a caged bird, at one moment would have
        got up and moved away, at the next turned to Betsy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us go, let us go!&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Betsy did not hear her. She was bending down, talking to a general
        who had come up to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch went up to Anna and courteously offered her his
        arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us go, if you like,&rdquo; he said in French, but Anna was
        listening to the general and did not notice her husband.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s broken his leg too, so they say,&rdquo; the general
        was saying. &ldquo;This is beyond everything.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Without answering her husband, Anna lifted her opera-glass and gazed
        towards the place where Vronsky had fallen; but it was so far off, and
        there was such a crowd of people about it, that she could make out
        nothing. She laid down the opera-glass, and would have moved away, but
        at that moment an officer galloped up and made some announcement to the
        Tsar. Anna craned forward, listening.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Stiva! Stiva!&rdquo; she cried to her brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        But her brother did not hear her. Again she would have moved away.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Once more I offer you my arm if you want to be going,&rdquo; said
        Alexey Alexandrovitch, reaching towards her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        She drew back from him with aversion, and without looking in his face
        answered:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no, let me be, I&rsquo;ll stay.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She saw now that from the place of Vronsky&rsquo;s accident an officer
        was running across the course towards the pavilion. Betsy waved her
        handkerchief to him. The officer brought the news that the rider was not
        killed, but the horse had broken its back.
      </p>

      <p>
        On hearing this Anna sat down hurriedly, and hid her face in her fan.
        Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that she was weeping, and could not control
        her tears, nor even the sobs that were shaking her bosom. Alexey
        Alexandrovitch stood so as to screen her, giving her time to recover
        herself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For the third time I offer you my arm,&rdquo; he said to her
        after a little time, turning to her. Anna gazed at him and did not know
        what to say. Princess Betsy came to her rescue.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, Alexey Alexandrovitch; I brought Anna and I promised to take
        her home,&rdquo; put in Betsy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, princess,&rdquo; he said, smiling courteously but
        looking her very firmly in the face, &ldquo;but I see that Anna&rsquo;s
        not very well, and I wish her to come home with me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna looked about her in a frightened way, got up submissively, and laid
        her hand on her husband&rsquo;s arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send to him and find out, and let you know,&rdquo;
        Betsy whispered to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        As they left the pavilion, Alexey Alexandrovitch, as always, talked to
        those he met, and Anna had, as always, to talk and answer; but she was
        utterly beside herself, and moved hanging on her husband&rsquo;s arm as
        though in a dream.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is he killed or not? Is it true? Will he come or not? Shall I see
        him today?&rdquo; she was thinking.
      </p>

      <p>
        She took her seat in her husband&rsquo;s carriage in silence, and in
        silence drove out of the crowd of carriages. In spite of all he had
        seen, Alexey Alexandrovitch still did not allow himself to consider his
        wife&rsquo;s real condition. He merely saw the outward symptoms. He saw
        that she was behaving unbecomingly, and considered it his duty to tell
        her so. But it was very difficult for him not to say more, to tell her
        nothing but that. He opened his mouth to tell her she had behaved
        unbecomingly, but he could not help saying something utterly different.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What an inclination we all have, though, for these cruel
        spectacles,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I observe....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Eh? I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Anna contemptuously.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was offended, and at once began to say what he had meant to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am obliged to tell you,&rdquo; he began.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So now we are to have it out,&rdquo; she thought, and she felt
        frightened.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am obliged to tell you that your behavior has been unbecoming
        today,&rdquo; he said to her in French.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In what way has my behavior been unbecoming?&rdquo; she said
        aloud, turning her head swiftly and looking him straight in the face,
        not with the bright expression that seemed covering something, but with
        a look of determination, under which she concealed with difficulty the
        dismay she was feeling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the open window opposite the
        coachman.
      </p>

      <p>
        He got up and pulled up the window.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What did you consider unbecoming?&rdquo; she repeated.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The despair you were unable to conceal at the accident to one of
        the riders.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He waited for her to answer, but she was silent, looking straight before
        her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have already begged you so to conduct yourself in society that
        even malicious tongues can find nothing to say against you. There was a
        time when I spoke of your inward attitude, but I am not speaking of that
        now. Now I speak only of your external attitude. You have behaved
        improperly, and I would wish it not to occur again.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She did not hear half of what he was saying; she felt panic-stricken
        before him, and was thinking whether it was true that Vronsky was not
        killed. Was it of him they were speaking when they said the rider was
        unhurt, but the horse had broken its back? She merely smiled with a
        pretense of irony when he finished, and made no reply, because she had
        not heard what he said. Alexey Alexandrovitch had begun to speak boldly,
        but as he realized plainly what he was speaking of, the dismay she was
        feeling infected him too. He saw the smile, and a strange
        misapprehension came over him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She is smiling at my suspicions. Yes, she will tell me directly
        what she told me before; that there is no foundation for my suspicions,
        that it&rsquo;s absurd.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment, when the revelation of everything was hanging over him,
        there was nothing he expected so much as that she would answer mockingly
        as before that his suspicions were absurd and utterly groundless. So
        terrible to him was what he knew that now he was ready to believe
        anything. But the expression of her face, scared and gloomy, did not now
        promise even deception.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Possibly I was mistaken,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If so, I beg your
        pardon.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, you were not mistaken,&rdquo; she said deliberately, looking
        desperately into his cold face. &ldquo;You were not mistaken. I was, and
        I could not help being in despair. I hear you, but I am thinking of him.
        I love him, I am his mistress; I can&rsquo;t bear you; I&rsquo;m afraid
        of you, and I hate you.... You can do what you like to me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And dropping back into the corner of the carriage, she broke into sobs,
        hiding her face in her hands. Alexey Alexandrovitch did not stir, and
        kept looking straight before him. But his whole face suddenly bore the
        solemn rigidity of the dead, and his expression did not change during
        the whole time of the drive home. On reaching the house he turned his
        head to her, still with the same expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well! But I expect a strict observance of the external forms
        of propriety till such time&rdquo;&mdash;his voice shook&mdash;&ldquo;as
        I may take measures to secure my honor and communicate them to
        you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He got out first and helped her to get out. Before the servants he
        pressed her hand, took his seat in the carriage, and drove back to
        Petersburg. Immediately afterwards a footman came from Princess Betsy
        and brought Anna a note.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I sent to Alexey to find out how he is, and he writes me he is
        quite well and unhurt, but in despair.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So <i>he</i> will be here,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;What a good
        thing I told him all!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She glanced at her watch. She had still three hours to wait, and the
        memories of their last meeting set her blood in flame.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My God, how light it is! It&rsquo;s dreadful, but I do love to
        see his face, and I do love this fantastic light.... My husband! Oh!
        yes.... Well, thank God! everything&rsquo;s over with him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 30</h3>

      <p>
        In the little German watering-place to which the Shtcherbatskys had
        betaken themselves, as in all places indeed where people are gathered
        together, the usual process, as it were, of the crystallization of
        society went on, assigning to each member of that society a definite and
        unalterable place. Just as the particle of water in frost, definitely
        and unalterably, takes the special form of the crystal of snow, so each
        new person that arrived at the springs was at once placed in his special
        place.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Fürst</i> Shtcherbatsky, <i>sammt Gemahlin und Tochter</i>, by the
        apartments they took, and from their name and from the friends they
        made, were immediately crystallized into a definite place marked out for
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was visiting the watering-place that year a real German Fürstin,
        in consequence of which the crystallizing process went on more
        vigorously than ever. Princess Shtcherbatskaya wished, above everything,
        to present her daughter to this German princess, and the day after their
        arrival she duly performed this rite. Kitty made a low and graceful
        curtsey in the <i>very simple</i>, that is to say, very elegant frock
        that had been ordered her from Paris. The German princess said, &ldquo;I
        hope the roses will soon come back to this pretty little face,&rdquo;
        and for the Shtcherbatskys certain definite lines of existence were at
        once laid down from which there was no departing. The Shtcherbatskys
        made the acquaintance too of the family of an English Lady Somebody, and
        of a German countess and her son, wounded in the last war, and of a
        learned Swede, and of M. Canut and his sister. But yet inevitably the
        Shtcherbatskys were thrown most into the society of a Moscow lady, Marya
        Yevgenyevna Rtishtcheva and her daughter, whom Kitty disliked, because
        she had fallen ill, like herself, over a love affair, and a Moscow
        colonel, whom Kitty had known from childhood, and always seen in uniform
        and epaulets, and who now, with his little eyes and his open neck and
        flowered cravat, was uncommonly ridiculous and tedious, because there
        was no getting rid of him. When all this was so firmly established,
        Kitty began to be very much bored, especially as the prince went away to
        Carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother. She took no interest in
        the people she knew, feeling that nothing fresh would come of them. Her
        chief mental interest in the watering-place consisted in watching and
        making theories about the people she did not know. It was characteristic
        of Kitty that she always imagined everything in people in the most
        favorable light possible, especially so in those she did not know. And
        now as she made surmises as to who people were, what were their
        relations to one another, and what they were like, Kitty endowed them
        with the most marvelous and noble characters, and found confirmation of
        her idea in her observations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of these people the one that attracted her most was a Russian girl who
        had come to the watering-place with an invalid Russian lady, Madame
        Stahl, as everyone called her. Madame Stahl belonged to the highest
        society, but she was so ill that she could not walk, and only on
        exceptionally fine days made her appearance at the springs in an invalid
        carriage. But it was not so much from ill-health as from pride&mdash;so
        Princess Shtcherbatskaya interpreted it&mdash;that Madame Stahl had not
        made the acquaintance of anyone among the Russians there. The Russian
        girl looked after Madame Stahl, and besides that, she was, as Kitty
        observed, on friendly terms with all the invalids who were seriously
        ill, and there were many of them at the springs, and looked after them
        in the most natural way. This Russian girl was not, as Kitty gathered,
        related to Madame Stahl, nor was she a paid attendant. Madame Stahl
        called her Varenka, and other people called her &ldquo;Mademoiselle
        Varenka.&rdquo; Apart from the interest Kitty took in this girl&rsquo;s
        relations with Madame Stahl and with other unknown persons, Kitty, as
        often happened, felt an inexplicable attraction to Mademoiselle Varenka,
        and was aware when their eyes met that she too liked her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of Mademoiselle Varenka one would not say that she had passed her first
        youth, but she was, as it were, a creature without youth; she might have
        been taken for nineteen or for thirty. If her features were criticized
        separately, she was handsome rather than plain, in spite of the sickly
        hue of her face. She would have been a good figure, too, if it had not
        been for her extreme thinness and the size of her head, which was too
        large for her medium height. But she was not likely to be attractive to
        men. She was like a fine flower, already past its bloom and without
        fragrance, though the petals were still unwithered. Moreover, she would
        have been unattractive to men also from the lack of just what Kitty had
        too much of&mdash;of the suppressed fire of vitality, and the
        consciousness of her own attractiveness.
      </p>

      <p>
        She always seemed absorbed in work about which there could be no doubt,
        and so it seemed she could not take interest in anything outside it. It
        was just this contrast with her own position that was for Kitty the
        great attraction of Mademoiselle Varenka. Kitty felt that in her, in her
        manner of life, she would find an example of what she was now so
        painfully seeking: interest in life, a dignity in life&mdash;apart from
        the worldly relations of girls with men, which so revolted Kitty, and
        appeared to her now as a shameful hawking about of goods in search of a
        purchaser. The more attentively Kitty watched her unknown friend, the
        more convinced she was this girl was the perfect creature she fancied
        her, and the more eagerly she wished to make her acquaintance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two girls used to meet several times a day, and every time they met,
        Kitty&rsquo;s eyes said: &ldquo;Who are you? What are you? Are you
        really the exquisite creature I imagine you to be? But for
        goodness&rsquo; sake don&rsquo;t suppose,&rdquo; her eyes added,
        &ldquo;that I would force my acquaintance on you, I simply admire you
        and like you.&rdquo; &ldquo;I like you too, and you&rsquo;re very, very
        sweet. And I should like you better still, if I had time,&rdquo;
        answered the eyes of the unknown girl. Kitty saw indeed, that she was
        always busy. Either she was taking the children of a Russian family home
        from the springs, or fetching a shawl for a sick lady, and wrapping her
        up in it, or trying to interest an irritable invalid, or selecting and
        buying cakes for tea for someone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Soon after the arrival of the Shtcherbatskys there appeared in the
        morning crowd at the springs two persons who attracted universal and
        unfavorable attention. These were a tall man with a stooping figure, and
        huge hands, in an old coat too short for him, with black, simple, and
        yet terrible eyes, and a pockmarked, kind-looking woman, very badly and
        tastelessly dressed. Recognizing these persons as Russians, Kitty had
        already in her imagination begun constructing a delightful and touching
        romance about them. But the princess, having ascertained from the
        visitors&rsquo; list that this was Nikolay Levin and Marya Nikolaevna,
        explained to Kitty what a bad man this Levin was, and all her fancies
        about these two people vanished. Not so much from what her mother told
        her, as from the fact that it was Konstantin&rsquo;s brother, this pair
        suddenly seemed to Kitty intensely unpleasant. This Levin, with his
        continual twitching of his head, aroused in her now an irrepressible
        feeling of disgust.
      </p>

      <p>
        It seemed to her that his big, terrible eyes, which persistently pursued
        her, expressed a feeling of hatred and contempt, and she tried to avoid
        meeting him.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 31</h3>

      <p>
        It was a wet day; it had been raining all the morning, and the invalids,
        with their parasols, had flocked into the arcades.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty was walking there with her mother and the Moscow colonel, smart
        and jaunty in his European coat, bought ready-made at Frankfort. They
        were walking on one side of the arcade, trying to avoid Levin, who was
        walking on the other side. Varenka, in her dark dress, in a black hat
        with a turn-down brim, was walking up and down the whole length of the
        arcade with a blind Frenchwoman, and, every time she met Kitty, they
        exchanged friendly glances.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mamma, couldn&rsquo;t I speak to her?&rdquo; said Kitty, watching
        her unknown friend, and noticing that she was going up to the spring,
        and that they might come there together.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, if you want to so much, I&rsquo;ll find out about her first
        and make her acquaintance myself,&rdquo; answered her mother.
        &ldquo;What do you see in her out of the way? A companion, she must be.
        If you like, I&rsquo;ll make acquaintance with Madame Stahl; I used to
        know her <i>belle-sœur</i>,&rdquo; added the princess, lifting her head
        haughtily.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty knew that the princess was offended that Madame Stahl had seemed
        to avoid making her acquaintance. Kitty did not insist.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How wonderfully sweet she is!&rdquo; she said, gazing at Varenka
        just as she handed a glass to the Frenchwoman. &ldquo;Look how natural
        and sweet it all is.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so funny to see your <i>engouements</i>,&rdquo; said
        the princess. &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;d better go back,&rdquo; she added,
        noticing Levin coming towards them with his companion and a German
        doctor, to whom he was talking very noisily and angrily.
      </p>

      <p>
        They turned to go back, when suddenly they heard, not noisy talk, but
        shouting. Levin, stopping short, was shouting at the doctor, and the
        doctor, too, was excited. A crowd gathered about them. The princess and
        Kitty beat a hasty retreat, while the colonel joined the crowd to find
        out what was the matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few minutes later the colonel overtook them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; inquired the princess.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Scandalous and disgraceful!&rdquo; answered the colonel.
        &ldquo;The one thing to be dreaded is meeting Russians abroad. That tall
        gentleman was abusing the doctor, flinging all sorts of insults at him
        because he wasn&rsquo;t treating him quite as he liked, and he began
        waving his stick at him. It&rsquo;s simply a scandal!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, how unpleasant!&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;Well, and
        how did it end?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Luckily at that point that ... the one in the mushroom hat ...
        intervened. A Russian lady, I think she is,&rdquo; said the colonel.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mademoiselle Varenka?&rdquo; asked Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes. She came to the rescue before anyone; she took the man
        by the arm and led him away.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There, mamma,&rdquo; said Kitty; &ldquo;you wonder that I&rsquo;m
        enthusiastic about her.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The next day, as she watched her unknown friend, Kitty noticed that
        Mademoiselle Varenka was already on the same terms with Levin and his
        companion as with her other <i>protégés</i>. She went up to them,
        entered into conversation with them, and served as interpreter for the
        woman, who could not speak any foreign language.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty began to entreat her mother still more urgently to let her make
        friends with Varenka. And, disagreeable as it was to the princess to
        seem to take the first step in wishing to make the acquaintance of
        Madame Stahl, who thought fit to give herself airs, she made inquiries
        about Varenka, and, having ascertained particulars about her tending to
        prove that there could be no harm though little good in the
        acquaintance, she herself approached Varenka and made acquaintance with
        her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Choosing a time when her daughter had gone to the spring, while Varenka
        had stopped outside the baker&rsquo;s, the princess went up to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Allow me to make your acquaintance,&rdquo; she said, with her
        dignified smile. &ldquo;My daughter has lost her heart to you,&rdquo;
        she said. &ldquo;Possibly you do not know me. I am....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That feeling is more than reciprocal, princess,&rdquo; Varenka
        answered hurriedly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a good deed you did yesterday to our poor compatriot!&rdquo;
        said the princess.
      </p>

      <p>
        Varenka flushed a little. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember. I don&rsquo;t
        think I did anything,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, you saved that Levin from disagreeable consequences.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, <i>sa compagne</i> called me, and I tried to pacify him,
        he&rsquo;s very ill, and was dissatisfied with the doctor. I&rsquo;m
        used to looking after such invalids.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard you live at Mentone with your aunt&mdash;I
        think&mdash;Madame Stahl: I used to know her <i>belle-sœur</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s not my aunt. I call her mamma, but I am not
        related to her; I was brought up by her,&rdquo; answered Varenka,
        flushing a little again.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was so simply said, and so sweet was the truthful and candid
        expression of her face, that the princess saw why Kitty had taken such a
        fancy to Varenka.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and what&rsquo;s this Levin going to do?&rdquo; asked the
        princess.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going away,&rdquo; answered Varenka.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that instant Kitty came up from the spring beaming with delight that
        her mother had become acquainted with her unknown friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, see, Kitty, your intense desire to make friends with
        Mademoiselle....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Varenka,&rdquo; Varenka put in smiling, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what
        everyone calls me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty blushed with pleasure, and slowly, without speaking, pressed her
        new friend&rsquo;s hand, which did not respond to her pressure, but lay
        motionless in her hand. The hand did not respond to her pressure, but
        the face of Mademoiselle Varenka glowed with a soft, glad, though rather
        mournful smile, that showed large but handsome teeth.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have long wished for this too,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you are so busy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, I&rsquo;m not at all busy,&rdquo; answered Varenka, but
        at that moment she had to leave her new friends because two little
        Russian girls, children of an invalid, ran up to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Varenka, mamma&rsquo;s calling!&rdquo; they cried.
      </p>

      <p>
        And Varenka went after them.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 32</h3>

      <p>
        The particulars which the princess had learned in regard to
        Varenka&rsquo;s past and her relations with Madame Stahl were as
        follows:
      </p>

      <p>
        Madame Stahl, of whom some people said that she had worried her husband
        out of his life, while others said it was he who had made her wretched
        by his immoral behavior, had always been a woman of weak health and
        enthusiastic temperament. When, after her separation from her husband,
        she gave birth to her only child, the child had died almost immediately,
        and the family of Madame Stahl, knowing her sensibility, and fearing the
        news would kill her, had substituted another child, a baby born the same
        night and in the same house in Petersburg, the daughter of the chief
        cook of the Imperial Household. This was Varenka. Madame Stahl learned
        later on that Varenka was not her own child, but she went on bringing
        her up, especially as very soon afterwards Varenka had not a relation of
        her own living. Madame Stahl had now been living more than ten years
        continuously abroad, in the south, never leaving her couch. And some
        people said that Madame Stahl had made her social position as a
        philanthropic, highly religious woman; other people said she really was
        at heart the highly ethical being, living for nothing but the good of
        her fellow creatures, which she represented herself to be. No one knew
        what her faith was&mdash;Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox. But one fact
        was indubitable&mdash;she was in amicable relations with the highest
        dignitaries of all the churches and sects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Varenka lived with her all the while abroad, and everyone who knew
        Madame Stahl knew and liked Mademoiselle Varenka, as everyone called
        her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having learned all these facts, the princess found nothing to object to
        in her daughter&rsquo;s intimacy with Varenka, more especially as
        Varenka&rsquo;s breeding and education were of the best&mdash;she spoke
        French and English extremely well&mdash;and what was of the most weight,
        brought a message from Madame Stahl expressing her regret that she was
        prevented by her ill health from making the acquaintance of the
        princess.
      </p>

      <p>
        After getting to know Varenka, Kitty became more and more fascinated by
        her friend, and every day she discovered new virtues in her.
      </p>

      <p>
        The princess, hearing that Varenka had a good voice, asked her to come
        and sing to them in the evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kitty plays, and we have a piano; not a good one, it&rsquo;s
        true, but you will give us so much pleasure,&rdquo; said the princess
        with her affected smile, which Kitty disliked particularly just then,
        because she noticed that Varenka had no inclination to sing. Varenka
        came, however, in the evening and brought a roll of music with her. The
        princess had invited Marya Yevgenyevna and her daughter and the colonel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Varenka seemed quite unaffected by there being persons present she did
        not know, and she went directly to the piano. She could not accompany
        herself, but she could sing music at sight very well. Kitty, who played
        well, accompanied her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You have an extraordinary talent,&rdquo; the princess said to her
        after Varenka had sung the first song extremely well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Marya Yevgenyevna and her daughter expressed their thanks and
        admiration.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said the colonel, looking out of the window,
        &ldquo;what an audience has collected to listen to you.&rdquo; There
        actually was quite a considerable crowd under the windows.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very glad it gives you pleasure,&rdquo; Varenka answered
        simply.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty looked with pride at her friend. She was enchanted by her talent,
        and her voice, and her face, but most of all by her manner, by the way
        Varenka obviously thought nothing of her singing and was quite unmoved
        by their praises. She seemed only to be asking: &ldquo;Am I to sing
        again, or is that enough?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If it had been I,&rdquo; thought Kitty, &ldquo;how proud I should
        have been! How delighted I should have been to see that crowd under the
        windows! But she&rsquo;s utterly unmoved by it. Her only motive is to
        avoid refusing and to please mamma. What is there in her? What is it
        gives her the power to look down on everything, to be calm independently
        of everything? How I should like to know it and to learn it of
        her!&rdquo; thought Kitty, gazing into her serene face. The princess
        asked Varenka to sing again, and Varenka sang another song, also
        smoothly, distinctly, and well, standing erect at the piano and beating
        time on it with her thin, dark-skinned hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next song in the book was an Italian one. Kitty played the opening
        bars, and looked round at Varenka.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s skip that,&rdquo; said Varenka, flushing a little.
        Kitty let her eyes rest on Varenka&rsquo;s face, with a look of dismay
        and inquiry.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, the next one,&rdquo; she said hurriedly, turning over
        the pages, and at once feeling that there was something connected with
        the song.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Varenka with a smile, laying her hand on the
        music, &ldquo;no, let&rsquo;s have that one.&rdquo; And she sang it just
        as quietly, as coolly, and as well as the others.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she had finished, they all thanked her again, and went off to tea.
        Kitty and Varenka went out into the little garden that adjoined the
        house.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Am I right, that you have some reminiscences connected with that
        song?&rdquo; said Kitty. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; she added
        hastily, &ldquo;only say if I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, why not? I&rsquo;ll tell you simply,&rdquo; said Varenka,
        and, without waiting for a reply, she went on: &ldquo;Yes, it brings up
        memories, once painful ones. I cared for someone once, and I used to
        sing him that song.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty with big, wide-open eyes gazed silently, sympathetically at
        Varenka.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I cared for him, and he cared for me; but his mother did not wish
        it, and he married another girl. He&rsquo;s living now not far from us,
        and I see him sometimes. You didn&rsquo;t think I had a love story
        too,&rdquo; she said, and there was a faint gleam in her handsome face
        of that fire which Kitty felt must once have glowed all over her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think so? Why, if I were a man, I could never care
        for anyone else after knowing you. Only I can&rsquo;t understand how he
        could, to please his mother, forget you and make you unhappy; he had no
        heart.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, he&rsquo;s a very good man, and I&rsquo;m not unhappy;
        quite the contrary, I&rsquo;m very happy. Well, so we shan&rsquo;t be
        singing any more now,&rdquo; she added, turning towards the house.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How good you are! how good you are!&rdquo; cried Kitty, and
        stopping her, she kissed her. &ldquo;If I could only be even a little
        like you!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why should you be like anyone? You&rsquo;re nice as you
        are,&rdquo; said Varenka, smiling her gentle, weary smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not nice at all. Come, tell me.... Stop a minute,
        let&rsquo;s sit down,&rdquo; said Kitty, making her sit down again
        beside her. &ldquo;Tell me, isn&rsquo;t it humiliating to think that a
        man has disdained your love, that he hasn&rsquo;t cared for
        it?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t disdain it; I believe he cared for me, but he
        was a dutiful son....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but if it hadn&rsquo;t been on account of his mother, if it
        had been his own doing?...&rdquo; said Kitty, feeling she was giving
        away her secret, and that her face, burning with the flush of shame, had
        betrayed her already.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In that case he would have done wrong, and I should not have
        regretted him,&rdquo; answered Varenka, evidently realizing that they
        were now talking not of her, but of Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But the humiliation,&rdquo; said Kitty, &ldquo;the humiliation
        one can never forget, can never forget,&rdquo; she said, remembering her
        look at the last ball during the pause in the music.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where is the humiliation? Why, you did nothing wrong?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Worse than wrong&mdash;shameful.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Varenka shook her head and laid her hand on Kitty&rsquo;s hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, what is there shameful?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
        didn&rsquo;t tell a man, who didn&rsquo;t care for you, that you loved
        him, did you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course not; I never said a word, but he knew it. No, no, there
        are looks, there are ways; I can&rsquo;t forget it, if I live a hundred
        years.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so? I don&rsquo;t understand. The whole point is whether you
        love him now or not,&rdquo; said Varenka, who called everything by its
        name.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I hate him; I can&rsquo;t forgive myself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, what for?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The shame, the humiliation!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! if everyone were as sensitive as you are!&rdquo; said
        Varenka. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a girl who hasn&rsquo;t been through
        the same. And it&rsquo;s all so unimportant.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, what is important?&rdquo; said Kitty, looking into her face
        with inquisitive wonder.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s so much that&rsquo;s important,&rdquo; said
        Varenka, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, what?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, so much that&rsquo;s more important,&rdquo; answered Varenka,
        not knowing what to say. But at that instant they heard the
        princess&rsquo;s voice from the window. &ldquo;Kitty, it&rsquo;s cold!
        Either get a shawl, or come indoors.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It really is time to go in!&rdquo; said Varenka, getting up.
        &ldquo;I have to go on to Madame Berthe&rsquo;s; she asked me to.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty held her by the hand, and with passionate curiosity and entreaty
        her eyes asked her: &ldquo;What is it, what is this of such importance
        that gives you such tranquillity? You know, tell me!&rdquo; But Varenka
        did not even know what Kitty&rsquo;s eyes were asking her. She merely
        thought that she had to go to see Madame Berthe too that evening, and to
        make haste home in time for
        <i>maman&rsquo;s</i> tea at twelve o&rsquo;clock. She went indoors,
        collected her music, and saying good-bye to everyone, was about to go.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Allow me to see you home,&rdquo; said the colonel.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, how can you go alone at night like this?&rdquo; chimed in
        the princess. &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll send Parasha.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty saw that Varenka could hardly restrain a smile at the idea that
        she needed an escort.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I always go about alone and nothing ever happens to
        me,&rdquo; she said, taking her hat. And kissing Kitty once more,
        without saying what was important, she stepped out courageously with the
        music under her arm and vanished into the twilight of the summer night,
        bearing away with her her secret of what was important and what gave her
        the calm and dignity so much to be envied.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 33</h3>

      <p>
        Kitty made the acquaintance of Madame Stahl too, and this acquaintance,
        together with her friendship with Varenka, did not merely exercise a
        great influence on her, it also comforted her in her mental distress.
        She found this comfort through a completely new world being opened to
        her by means of this acquaintance, a world having nothing in common with
        her past, an exalted, noble world, from the height of which she could
        contemplate her past calmly. It was revealed to her that besides the
        instinctive life to which Kitty had given herself up hitherto there was
        a spiritual life. This life was disclosed in religion, but a religion
        having nothing in common with that one which Kitty had known from
        childhood, and which found expression in litanies and all-night services
        at the Widow&rsquo;s Home, where one might meet one&rsquo;s friends, and
        in learning by heart Slavonic texts with the priest. This was a lofty,
        mysterious religion connected with a whole series of noble thoughts and
        feelings, which one could do more than merely believe because one was
        told to, which one could love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty found all this out not from words. Madame Stahl talked to Kitty as
        to a charming child that one looks on with pleasure as on the memory of
        one&rsquo;s youth, and only once she said in passing that in all human
        sorrows nothing gives comfort but love and faith, and that in the sight
        of Christ&rsquo;s compassion for us no sorrow is trifling&mdash;and
        immediately talked of other things. But in every gesture of Madame
        Stahl, in every word, in every heavenly&mdash;as Kitty called
        it&mdash;look, and above all in the whole story of her life, which she
        heard from Varenka, Kitty recognized that something &ldquo;that was
        important,&rdquo; of which, till then, she had known nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet, elevated as Madame Stahl&rsquo;s character was, touching as was her
        story, and exalted and moving as was her speech, Kitty could not help
        detecting in her some traits which perplexed her. She noticed that when
        questioning her about her family, Madame Stahl had smiled
        contemptuously, which was not in accord with Christian meekness. She
        noticed, too, that when she had found a Catholic priest with her, Madame
        Stahl had studiously kept her face in the shadow of the lamp-shade and
        had smiled in a peculiar way. Trivial as these two observations were,
        they perplexed her, and she had her doubts as to Madame Stahl. But on
        the other hand Varenka, alone in the world, without friends or
        relations, with a melancholy disappointment in the past, desiring
        nothing, regretting nothing, was just that perfection of which Kitty
        dared hardly dream. In Varenka she realized that one has but to forget
        oneself and love others, and one will be calm, happy, and noble. And
        that was what Kitty longed to be. Seeing now clearly what was
        <i>the most important</i>, Kitty was not satisfied with being
        enthusiastic over it; she at once gave herself up with her whole soul to
        the new life that was opening to her. From Varenka&rsquo;s accounts of
        the doings of Madame Stahl and other people whom she mentioned, Kitty
        had already constructed the plan of her own future life. She would, like
        Madame Stahl&rsquo;s niece, Aline, of whom Varenka had talked to her a
        great deal, seek out those who were in trouble, wherever she might be
        living, help them as far as she could, give them the Gospel, read the
        Gospel to the sick, to criminals, to the dying. The idea of reading the
        Gospel to criminals, as Aline did, particularly fascinated Kitty. But
        all these were secret dreams, of which Kitty did not talk either to her
        mother or to Varenka.
      </p>

      <p>
        While awaiting the time for carrying out her plans on a large scale,
        however, Kitty, even then at the springs, where there were so many
        people ill and unhappy, readily found a chance for practicing her new
        principles in imitation of Varenka.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first the princess noticed nothing but that Kitty was much under the
        influence of her <i>engouement</i>, as she called it, for Madame Stahl,
        and still more for Varenka. She saw that Kitty did not merely imitate
        Varenka in her conduct, but unconsciously imitated her in her manner of
        walking, of talking, of blinking her eyes. But later on the princess
        noticed that, apart from this adoration, some kind of serious spiritual
        change was taking place in her daughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        The princess saw that in the evenings Kitty read a French testament that
        Madame Stahl had given her&mdash;a thing she had never done before; that
        she avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people
        who were under Varenka&rsquo;s protection, and especially one poor
        family, that of a sick painter, Petrov. Kitty was unmistakably proud of
        playing the part of a sister of mercy in that family. All this was well
        enough, and the princess had nothing to say against it, especially as
        Petrov&rsquo;s wife was a perfectly nice sort of woman, and that the
        German princess, noticing Kitty&rsquo;s devotion, praised her, calling
        her an angel of consolation. All this would have been very well, if
        there had been no exaggeration. But the princess saw that her daughter
        was rushing into extremes, and so indeed she told her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Il ne faut jamais rien outrer</i>,&rdquo; she said to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her daughter made her no reply, only in her heart she thought that one
        could not talk about exaggeration where Christianity was concerned. What
        exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein one
        was bidden to turn the other cheek when one was smitten, and give
        one&rsquo;s cloak if one&rsquo;s coat were taken? But the princess
        disliked this exaggeration, and disliked even more the fact that she
        felt her daughter did not care to show her all her heart. Kitty did in
        fact conceal her new views and feelings from her mother. She concealed
        them not because she did not respect or did not love her mother, but
        simply because she was her mother. She would have revealed them to
        anyone sooner than to her mother.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How is it Anna Pavlovna&rsquo;s not been to see us for so
        long?&rdquo; the princess said one day of Madame Petrova.
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked her, but she seems put out about
        something.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve not noticed it, maman,&rdquo; said Kitty, flushing
        hotly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it long since you went to see them?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;re meaning to make an expedition to the mountains
        tomorrow,&rdquo; answered Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you can go,&rdquo; answered the princess, gazing at her
        daughter&rsquo;s embarrassed face and trying to guess the cause of her
        embarrassment.
      </p>

      <p>
        That day Varenka came to dinner and told them that Anna Pavlovna had
        changed her mind and given up the expedition for the morrow. And the
        princess noticed again that Kitty reddened.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kitty, haven&rsquo;t you had some misunderstanding with the
        Petrovs?&rdquo; said the princess, when they were left alone. &ldquo;Why
        has she given up sending the children and coming to see us?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty answered that nothing had happened between them, and that she
        could not tell why Anna Pavlovna seemed displeased with her. Kitty
        answered perfectly truly. She did not know the reason Anna Pavlovna had
        changed to her, but she guessed it. She guessed at something which she
        could not tell her mother, which she did not put into words to herself.
        It was one of those things which one knows but which one can never speak
        of even to oneself, so terrible and shameful would it be to be mistaken.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again and again she went over in her memory all her relations with the
        family. She remembered the simple delight expressed on the round,
        good-humored face of Anna Pavlovna at their meetings; she remembered
        their secret confabulations about the invalid, their plots to draw him
        away from the work which was forbidden him, and to get him out-of-doors;
        the devotion of the youngest boy, who used to call her &ldquo;my
        Kitty,&rdquo; and would not go to bed without her. How nice it all was!
        Then she recalled the thin, terribly thin figure of Petrov, with his
        long neck, in his brown coat, his scant, curly hair, his questioning
        blue eyes that were so terrible to Kitty at first, and his painful
        attempts to seem hearty and lively in her presence. She recalled the
        efforts she had made at first to overcome the repugnance she felt for
        him, as for all consumptive people, and the pains it had cost her to
        think of things to say to him. She recalled the timid, softened look
        with which he gazed at her, and the strange feeling of compassion and
        awkwardness, and later of a sense of her own goodness, which she had
        felt at it. How nice it all was! But all that was at first. Now, a few
        days ago, everything was suddenly spoiled. Anna Pavlovna had met Kitty
        with affected cordiality, and had kept continual watch on her and on her
        husband.
      </p>

      <p>
        Could that touching pleasure he showed when she came near be the cause
        of Anna Pavlovna&rsquo;s coolness?
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;there was something unnatural about
        Anna Pavlovna, and utterly unlike her good nature, when she said angrily
        the day before yesterday: &lsquo;There, he will keep waiting for you; he
        wouldn&rsquo;t drink his coffee without you, though he&rsquo;s grown so
        dreadfully weak.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, perhaps, too, she didn&rsquo;t like it when I gave him the
        rug. It was all so simple, but he took it so awkwardly, and was so long
        thanking me, that I felt awkward too. And then that portrait of me he
        did so well. And most of all that look of confusion and tenderness! Yes,
        yes, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Kitty repeated to herself with horror.
        &ldquo;No, it can&rsquo;t be, it oughtn&rsquo;t to be! He&rsquo;s so
        much to be pitied!&rdquo; she said to herself directly after.
      </p>

      <p>
        This doubt poisoned the charm of her new life.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 34</h3>

      <p>
        Before the end of the course of drinking the waters, Prince
        Shtcherbatsky, who had gone on from Carlsbad to Baden and Kissingen to
        Russian friends&mdash;to get a breath of Russian air, as he
        said&mdash;came back to his wife and daughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        The views of the prince and of the princess on life abroad were
        completely opposed. The princess thought everything delightful, and in
        spite of her established position in Russian society, she tried abroad
        to be like a European fashionable lady, which she was not&mdash;for the
        simple reason that she was a typical Russian gentlewoman; and so she was
        affected, which did not altogether suit her. The prince, on the
        contrary, thought everything foreign detestable, got sick of European
        life, kept to his Russian habits, and purposely tried to show himself
        abroad less European than he was in reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        The prince returned thinner, with the skin hanging in loose bags on his
        cheeks, but in the most cheerful frame of mind. His good humor was even
        greater when he saw Kitty completely recovered. The news of
        Kitty&rsquo;s friendship with Madame Stahl and Varenka, and the reports
        the princess gave him of some kind of change she had noticed in Kitty,
        troubled the prince and aroused his habitual feeling of jealousy of
        everything that drew his daughter away from him, and a dread that his
        daughter might have got out of the reach of his influence into regions
        inaccessible to him. But these unpleasant matters were all drowned in
        the sea of kindliness and good humor which was always within him, and
        more so than ever since his course of Carlsbad waters.
      </p>

      <p>
        The day after his arrival the prince, in his long overcoat, with his
        Russian wrinkles and baggy cheeks propped up by a starched collar, set
        off with his daughter to the spring in the greatest good humor.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was a lovely morning: the bright, cheerful houses with their little
        gardens, the sight of the red-faced, red-armed, beer-drinking German
        waitresses, working away merrily, did the heart good. But the nearer
        they got to the springs the oftener they met sick people; and their
        appearance seemed more pitiable than ever among the everyday conditions
        of prosperous German life. Kitty was no longer struck by this contrast.
        The bright sun, the brilliant green of the foliage, the strains of the
        music were for her the natural setting of all these familiar faces, with
        their changes to greater emaciation or to convalescence, for which she
        watched. But to the prince the brightness and gaiety of the June
        morning, and the sound of the orchestra playing a gay waltz then in
        fashion, and above all, the appearance of the healthy attendants, seemed
        something unseemly and monstrous, in conjunction with these slowly
        moving, dying figures gathered together from all parts of Europe. In
        spite of his feeling of pride and, as it were, of the return of youth,
        with his favorite daughter on his arm, he felt awkward, and almost
        ashamed of his vigorous step and his sturdy, stout limbs. He felt almost
        like a man not dressed in a crowd.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Present me to your new friends,&rdquo; he said to his daughter,
        squeezing her hand with his elbow. &ldquo;I like even your horrid Soden
        for making you so well again. Only it&rsquo;s melancholy, very
        melancholy here. Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty mentioned the names of all the people they met, with some of whom
        she was acquainted and some not. At the entrance of the garden they met
        the blind lady, Madame Berthe, with her guide, and the prince was
        delighted to see the old Frenchwoman&rsquo;s face light up when she
        heard Kitty&rsquo;s voice. She at once began talking to him with French
        exaggerated politeness, applauding him for having such a delightful
        daughter, extolling Kitty to the skies before her face, and calling her
        a treasure, a pearl, and a consoling angel.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s the second angel, then,&rdquo; said the prince,
        smiling. &ldquo;she calls Mademoiselle Varenka angel number one.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! Mademoiselle Varenka, she&rsquo;s a real angel, allez,&rdquo;
        Madame Berthe assented.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the arcade they met Varenka herself. She was walking rapidly towards
        them carrying an elegant red bag.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here is papa come,&rdquo; Kitty said to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Varenka made&mdash;simply and naturally as she did everything&mdash;a
        movement between a bow and a curtsey, and immediately began talking to
        the prince, without shyness, naturally, as she talked to everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course I know you; I know you very well,&rdquo; the prince
        said to her with a smile, in which Kitty detected with joy that her
        father liked her friend. &ldquo;Where are you off to in such
        haste?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Maman&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; she said, turning to Kitty. &ldquo;She
        has not slept all night, and the doctor advised her to go out. I&rsquo;m
        taking her her work.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s angel number one?&rdquo; said the prince when
        Varenka had gone on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty saw that her father had meant to make fun of Varenka, but that he
        could not do it because he liked her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, so we shall see all your friends,&rdquo; he went on,
        &ldquo;even Madame Stahl, if she deigns to recognize me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, did you know her, papa?&rdquo; Kitty asked apprehensively,
        catching the gleam of irony that kindled in the prince&rsquo;s eyes at
        the mention of Madame Stahl.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I used to know her husband, and her too a little, before
        she&rsquo;d joined the Pietists.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is a Pietist, papa?&rdquo; asked Kitty, dismayed to find
        that what she prized so highly in Madame Stahl had a name.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know myself. I only know that she thanks God
        for everything, for every misfortune, and thanks God too that her
        husband died. And that&rsquo;s rather droll, as they didn&rsquo;t get on
        together.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that? What a piteous face!&rdquo; he asked, noticing
        a sick man of medium height sitting on a bench, wearing a brown overcoat
        and white trousers that fell in strange folds about his long, fleshless
        legs. This man lifted his straw hat, showed his scanty curly hair and
        high forehead, painfully reddened by the pressure of the hat.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Petrov, an artist,&rdquo; answered Kitty, blushing.
        &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s his wife,&rdquo; she added, indicating Anna
        Pavlovna, who, as though on purpose, at the very instant they approached
        walked away after a child that had run off along a path.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Poor fellow! and what a nice face he has!&rdquo; said the prince.
        &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go up to him? He wanted to speak to
        you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, let us go, then,&rdquo; said Kitty, turning round
        resolutely. &ldquo;How are you feeling today?&rdquo; she asked Petrov.
      </p>

      <p>
        Petrov got up, leaning on his stick, and looked shyly at the prince.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This is my daughter,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;Let me
        introduce myself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The painter bowed and smiled, showing his strangely dazzling white
        teeth.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We expected you yesterday, princess,&rdquo; he said to Kitty. He
        staggered as he said this, and then repeated the motion, trying to make
        it seem as if it had been intentional.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I meant to come, but Varenka said that Anna Pavlovna sent word
        you were not going.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not going!&rdquo; said Petrov, blushing, and immediately
        beginning to cough, and his eyes sought his wife. &ldquo;Anita!
        Anita!&rdquo; he said loudly, and the swollen veins stood out like cords
        on his thin white neck.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna Pavlovna came up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you sent word to the princess that we weren&rsquo;t
        going!&rdquo; he whispered to her angrily, losing his voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Good morning, princess,&rdquo; said Anna Pavlovna, with an
        assumed smile utterly unlike her former manner. &ldquo;Very glad to make
        your acquaintance,&rdquo; she said to the prince. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
        long been expected, prince.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What did you send word to the princess that we weren&rsquo;t
        going for?&rdquo; the artist whispered hoarsely once more, still more
        angrily, obviously exasperated that his voice failed him so that he
        could not give his words the expression he would have liked to.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, mercy on us! I thought we weren&rsquo;t going,&rdquo; his
        wife answered crossly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What, when....&rdquo; He coughed and waved his hand. The prince
        took off his hat and moved away with his daughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; he sighed deeply. &ldquo;Oh, poor things!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, papa,&rdquo; answered Kitty. &ldquo;And you must know
        they&rsquo;ve three children, no servant, and scarcely any means. He
        gets something from the Academy,&rdquo; she went on briskly, trying to
        drown the distress that the queer change in Anna Pavlovna&rsquo;s manner
        to her had aroused in her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, here&rsquo;s Madame Stahl,&rdquo; said Kitty, indicating an
        invalid carriage, where, propped on pillows, something in gray and blue
        was lying under a sunshade. This was Madame Stahl. Behind her stood the
        gloomy, healthy-looking German workman who pushed the carriage. Close by
        was standing a flaxen-headed Swedish count, whom Kitty knew by name.
        Several invalids were lingering near the low carriage, staring at the
        lady as though she were some curiosity.
      </p>

      <p>
        The prince went up to her, and Kitty detected that disconcerting gleam
        of irony in his eyes. He went up to Madame Stahl, and addressed her with
        extreme courtesy and affability in that excellent French that so few
        speak nowadays.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you remember me, but I must recall myself
        to thank you for your kindness to my daughter,&rdquo; he said, taking
        off his hat and not putting it on again.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Prince Alexander Shtcherbatsky,&rdquo; said Madame Stahl, lifting
        upon him her heavenly eyes, in which Kitty discerned a look of
        annoyance. &ldquo;Delighted! I have taken a great fancy to your
        daughter.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are still in weak health?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m used to it,&rdquo; said Madame Stahl, and she
        introduced the prince to the Swedish count.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are scarcely changed at all,&rdquo; the prince said to her.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ten or eleven years since I had the honor of seeing
        you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; God sends the cross and sends the strength to bear it. Often
        one wonders what is the goal of this life?... The other side!&rdquo; she
        said angrily to Varenka, who had rearranged the rug over her feet not to
        her satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To do good, probably,&rdquo; said the prince with a twinkle in
        his eye.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That is not for us to judge,&rdquo; said Madame Stahl, perceiving
        the shade of expression on the prince&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;So you will
        send me that book, dear count? I&rsquo;m very grateful to you,&rdquo;
        she said to the young Swede.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried the prince, catching sight of the Moscow colonel
        standing near, and with a bow to Madame Stahl he walked away with his
        daughter and the Moscow colonel, who joined them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our aristocracy, prince!&rdquo; the Moscow colonel
        said with ironical intention. He cherished a grudge against Madame Stahl
        for not making his acquaintance.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just the same,&rdquo; replied the prince.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you know her before her illness, prince&mdash;that&rsquo;s to
        say before she took to her bed?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes. She took to her bed before my eyes,&rdquo; said the prince.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They say it&rsquo;s ten years since she has stood on her
        feet.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t stand up because her legs are too short.
        She&rsquo;s a very bad figure.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Papa, it&rsquo;s not possible!&rdquo; cried Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what wicked tongues say, my darling. And your
        Varenka catches it too,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Oh, these invalid
        ladies!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, papa!&rdquo; Kitty objected warmly. &ldquo;Varenka
        worships her. And then she does so much good! Ask anyone! Everyone knows
        her and Aline Stahl.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said the prince, squeezing her hand with his
        elbow; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s better when one does good so that you may
        ask everyone and no one knows.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty did not answer, not because she had nothing to say, but because
        she did not care to reveal her secret thoughts even to her father. But,
        strange to say, although she had so made up her mind not to be
        influenced by her father&rsquo;s views, not to let him into her inmost
        sanctuary, she felt that the heavenly image of Madame Stahl, which she
        had carried for a whole month in her heart, had vanished, never to
        return, just as the fantastic figure made up of some clothes thrown down
        at random vanishes when one sees that it is only some garment lying
        there. All that was left was a woman with short legs, who lay down
        because she had a bad figure, and worried patient Varenka for not
        arranging her rug to her liking. And by no effort of the imagination
        could Kitty bring back the former Madame Stahl.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 35</h3>

      <p>
        The prince communicated his good humor to his own family and his
        friends, and even to the German landlord in whose rooms the
        Shtcherbatskys were staying.
      </p>

      <p>
        On coming back with Kitty from the springs, the prince, who had asked
        the colonel, and Marya Yevgenyevna, and Varenka all to come and have
        coffee with them, gave orders for a table and chairs to be taken into
        the garden under the chestnut tree, and lunch to be laid there. The
        landlord and the servants, too, grew brisker under the influence of his
        good spirits. They knew his open-handedness; and half an hour later the
        invalid doctor from Hamburg, who lived on the top floor, looked
        enviously out of the window at the merry party of healthy Russians
        assembled under the chestnut tree. In the trembling circles of shadow
        cast by the leaves, at a table, covered with a white cloth, and set with
        coffeepot, bread-and-butter, cheese, and cold game, sat the princess in
        a high cap with lilac ribbons, distributing cups and bread-and-butter.
        At the other end sat the prince, eating heartily, and talking loudly and
        merrily. The prince had spread out near him his purchases, carved boxes,
        and knick-knacks, paper-knives of all sorts, of which he bought a heap
        at every watering-place, and bestowed them upon everyone, including
        Lieschen, the servant girl, and the landlord, with whom he jested in his
        comically bad German, assuring him that it was not the water had cured
        Kitty, but his splendid cookery, especially his plum soup. The princess
        laughed at her husband for his Russian ways, but she was more lively and
        good-humored than she had been all the while she had been at the waters.
        The colonel smiled, as he always did, at the prince&rsquo;s jokes, but
        as far as regards Europe, of which he believed himself to be making a
        careful study, he took the princess&rsquo;s side. The simple-hearted
        Marya Yevgenyevna simply roared with laughter at everything absurd the
        prince said, and his jokes made Varenka helpless with feeble but
        infectious laughter, which was something Kitty had never seen before.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty was glad of all this, but she could not be light-hearted. She
        could not solve the problem her father had unconsciously set her by his
        good-humored view of her friends, and of the life that had so attracted
        her. To this doubt there was joined the change in her relations with the
        Petrovs, which had been so conspicuously and unpleasantly marked that
        morning. Everyone was good-humored, but Kitty could not feel
        good-humored, and this increased her distress. She felt a feeling such
        as she had known in childhood, when she had been shut in her room as a
        punishment, and had heard her sisters&rsquo; merry laughter outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, but what did you buy this mass of things for?&rdquo; said
        the princess, smiling, and handing her husband a cup of coffee.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;One goes for a walk, one looks in a shop, and they ask you to
        buy. &lsquo;<i>Erlaucht, Durchlaucht?</i>&rsquo; Directly they say
        &lsquo;<i>Durchlaucht</i>,&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t hold out. I lose ten
        thalers.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply from boredom,&rdquo; said the princess.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course it is. Such boredom, my dear, that one doesn&rsquo;t
        know what to do with oneself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How can you be bored, prince? There&rsquo;s so much that&rsquo;s
        interesting now in Germany,&rdquo; said Marya Yevgenyevna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I know everything that&rsquo;s interesting: the plum soup I
        know, and the pea sausages I know. I know everything.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, you may say what you like, prince, there&rsquo;s the interest
        of their institutions,&rdquo; said the colonel.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what is there interesting about it? They&rsquo;re all as
        pleased as brass halfpence. They&rsquo;ve conquered everybody, and why
        am I to be pleased at that? I haven&rsquo;t conquered anyone; and
        I&rsquo;m obliged to take off my own boots, yes, and put them away too;
        in the morning, get up and dress at once, and go to the dining-room to
        drink bad tea! How different it is at home! You get up in no haste, you
        get cross, grumble a little, and come round again. You&rsquo;ve time to
        think things over, and no hurry.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But time&rsquo;s money, you forget that,&rdquo; said the colonel.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Time, indeed, that depends! Why, there&rsquo;s time one would
        give a month of for sixpence, and time you wouldn&rsquo;t give half an
        hour of for any money. Isn&rsquo;t that so, Katinka? What is it? why are
        you so depressed?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not depressed.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where are you off to? Stay a little longer,&rdquo; he said to
        Varenka.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I must be going home,&rdquo; said Varenka, getting up, and again
        she went off into a giggle. When she had recovered, she said good-bye,
        and went into the house to get her hat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty followed her. Even Varenka struck her as different. She was not
        worse, but different from what she had fancied her before.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, dear! it&rsquo;s a long while since I&rsquo;ve laughed so
        much!&rdquo; said Varenka, gathering up her parasol and her bag.
        &ldquo;How nice he is, your father!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty did not speak.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;When shall I see you again?&rdquo; asked Varenka.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mamma meant to go and see the Petrovs. Won&rsquo;t you be
        there?&rdquo; said Kitty, to try Varenka.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Varenka. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting ready
        to go away, so I promised to help them pack.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll come too, then.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, why should you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why not? why not? why not?&rdquo; said Kitty, opening her eyes
        wide, and clutching at Varenka&rsquo;s parasol, so as not to let her go.
        &ldquo;No, wait a minute; why not?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, nothing; your father has come, and besides, they will feel
        awkward at your helping.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, tell me why you don&rsquo;t want me to be often at the
        Petrovs&rsquo;. You don&rsquo;t want me to&mdash;why not?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; said Varenka quietly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, please tell me!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell you everything?&rdquo; asked Varenka.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Everything, everything!&rdquo; Kitty assented.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s really nothing of any consequence; only that
        Mihail Alexeyevitch&rdquo; (that was the artist&rsquo;s name) &ldquo;had
        meant to leave earlier, and now he doesn&rsquo;t want to go away,&rdquo;
        said Varenka, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; Kitty urged impatiently, looking darkly at
        Varenka.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and for some reason Anna Pavlovna told him that he
        didn&rsquo;t want to go because you are here. Of course, that was
        nonsense; but there was a dispute over it&mdash;over you. You know how
        irritable these sick people are.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty, scowling more than ever, kept silent, and Varenka went on
        speaking alone, trying to soften or soothe her, and seeing a storm
        coming&mdash;she did not know whether of tears or of words.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you&rsquo;d better not go.... You understand; you won&rsquo;t
        be offended?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And it serves me right! And it serves me right!&rdquo; Kitty
        cried quickly, snatching the parasol out of Varenka&rsquo;s hand, and
        looking past her friend&rsquo;s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Varenka felt inclined to smile, looking at her childish fury, but she
        was afraid of wounding her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How does it serve you right? I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It serves me right, because it was all sham; because it was all
        done on purpose, and not from the heart. What business had I to
        interfere with outsiders? And so it&rsquo;s come about that I&rsquo;m a
        cause of quarrel, and that I&rsquo;ve done what nobody asked me to do.
        Because it was all a sham! a sham! a sham!...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A sham! with what object?&rdquo; said Varenka gently.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s so idiotic! so hateful! There was no need whatever
        for me.... Nothing but sham!&rdquo; she said, opening and shutting the
        parasol.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But with what object?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To seem better to people, to myself, to God; to deceive everyone.
        No! now I won&rsquo;t descend to that. I&rsquo;ll be bad; but anyway not
        a liar, a cheat.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But who is a cheat?&rdquo; said Varenka reproachfully. &ldquo;You
        speak as if....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But Kitty was in one of her gusts of fury, and she would not let her
        finish.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t talk about you, not about you at all. You&rsquo;re
        perfection. Yes, yes, I know you&rsquo;re all perfection; but what am I
        to do if I&rsquo;m bad? This would never have been if I weren&rsquo;t
        bad. So let me be what I am. I won&rsquo;t be a sham. What have I to do
        with Anna Pavlovna? Let them go their way, and me go mine. I can&rsquo;t
        be different.... And yet it&rsquo;s not that, it&rsquo;s not
        that.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is not that?&rdquo; asked Varenka in bewilderment.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Everything. I can&rsquo;t act except from the heart, and you act
        from principle. I liked you simply, but you most likely only wanted to
        save me, to improve me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are unjust,&rdquo; said Varenka.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not speaking of other people, I&rsquo;m speaking of
        myself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; they heard her mother&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;come
        here, show papa your necklace.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty, with a haughty air, without making peace with her friend, took
        the necklace in a little box from the table and went to her mother.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Why are you so red?&rdquo; her mother
        and father said to her with one voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back
        directly,&rdquo; and she ran back.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s still here,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;What am I to
        say to her? Oh, dear! what have I done, what have I said? Why was I rude
        to her? What am I to do? What am I to say to her?&rdquo; thought Kitty,
        and she stopped in the doorway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Varenka in her hat and with the parasol in her hands was sitting at the
        table examining the spring which Kitty had broken. She lifted her head.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Varenka, forgive me, do forgive me,&rdquo; whispered Kitty, going
        up to her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember what I said. I....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I really didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you,&rdquo; said Varenka,
        smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Peace was made. But with her father&rsquo;s coming all the world in
        which she had been living was transformed for Kitty. She did not give up
        everything she had learned, but she became aware that she had deceived
        herself in supposing she could be what she wanted to be. Her eyes were,
        it seemed, opened; she felt all the difficulty of maintaining herself
        without hypocrisy and self-conceit on the pinnacle to which she had
        wished to mount. Moreover, she became aware of all the dreariness of the
        world of sorrow, of sick and dying people, in which she had been living.
        The efforts she had made to like it seemed to her intolerable, and she
        felt a longing to get back quickly into the fresh air, to Russia, to
        Ergushovo, where, as she knew from letters, her sister Dolly had already
        gone with her children.
      </p>

      <p>
        But her affection for Varenka did not wane. As she said good-bye, Kitty
        begged her to come to them in Russia.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come when you get married,&rdquo; said Varenka.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall never marry.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, I shall never come.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, I shall be married simply for that. Mind now,
        remember your promise,&rdquo; said Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        The doctor&rsquo;s prediction was fulfilled. Kitty returned home to
        Russia cured. She was not so gay and thoughtless as before, but she was
        serene. Her Moscow troubles had become a memory to her.

      <h2>PART THREE</h2>

      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev wanted a rest from mental work, and instead
        of going abroad as he usually did, he came towards the end of May to
        stay in the country with his brother. In his judgment the best sort of
        life was a country life. He had come now to enjoy such a life at his
        brother&rsquo;s. Konstantin Levin was very glad to have him, especially
        as he did not expect his brother Nikolay that summer. But in spite of
        his affection and respect for Sergey Ivanovitch, Konstantin Levin was
        uncomfortable with his brother in the country. It made him
        uncomfortable, and it positively annoyed him to see his brother&rsquo;s
        attitude to the country. To Konstantin Levin the country was the
        background of life, that is of pleasures, endeavors, labor. To Sergey
        Ivanovitch the country meant on one hand rest from work, on the other a
        valuable antidote to the corrupt influences of town, which he took with
        satisfaction and a sense of its utility. To Konstantin Levin the country
        was good first because it afforded a field for labor, of the usefulness
        of which there could be no doubt. To Sergey Ivanovitch the country was
        particularly good, because there it was possible and fitting to do
        nothing. Moreover, Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s attitude to the peasants
        rather piqued Konstantin. Sergey Ivanovitch used to say that he knew and
        liked the peasantry, and he often talked to the peasants, which he knew
        how to do without affectation or condescension, and from every such
        conversation he would deduce general conclusions in favor of the
        peasantry and in confirmation of his knowing them. Konstantin Levin did
        not like such an attitude to the peasants. To Konstantin the peasant was
        simply the chief partner in their common labor, and in spite of all the
        respect and the love, almost like that of kinship, he had for the
        peasant&mdash;sucked in probably, as he said himself, with the milk of
        his peasant nurse&mdash;still as a fellow-worker with him, while
        sometimes enthusiastic over the vigor, gentleness, and justice of these
        men, he was very often, when their common labors called for other
        qualities, exasperated with the peasant for his carelessness, lack of
        method, drunkenness, and lying. If he had been asked whether he liked or
        didn&rsquo;t like the peasants, Konstantin Levin would have been
        absolutely at a loss what to reply. He liked and did not like the
        peasants, just as he liked and did not like men in general. Of course,
        being a good-hearted man, he liked men rather than he disliked them, and
        so too with the peasants. But like or dislike &ldquo;the people&rdquo;
        as something apart he could not, not only because he lived with
        &ldquo;the people,&rdquo; and all his interests were bound up with
        theirs, but also because he regarded himself as a part of &ldquo;the
        people,&rdquo; did not see any special qualities or failings
        distinguishing himself and &ldquo;the people,&rdquo; and could not
        contrast himself with them. Moreover, although he had lived so long in
        the closest relations with the peasants, as farmer and arbitrator, and
        what was more, as adviser (the peasants trusted him, and for thirty
        miles round they would come to ask his advice), he had no definite views
        of &ldquo;the people,&rdquo; and would have been as much at a loss to
        answer the question whether he knew &ldquo;the people&rdquo; as the
        question whether he liked them. For him to say he knew the peasantry
        would have been the same as to say he knew men. He was continually
        watching and getting to know people of all sorts, and among them
        peasants, whom he regarded as good and interesting people, and he was
        continually observing new points in them, altering his former views of
        them and forming new ones. With Sergey Ivanovitch it was quite the
        contrary. Just as he liked and praised a country life in comparison with
        the life he did not like, so too he liked the peasantry in
        contradistinction to the class of men he did not like, and so too he
        knew the peasantry as something distinct from and opposed to men
        generally. In his methodical brain there were distinctly formulated
        certain aspects of peasant life, deduced partly from that life itself,
        but chiefly from contrast with other modes of life. He never changed his
        opinion of the peasantry and his sympathetic attitude towards them.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the discussions that arose between the brothers on their views of the
        peasantry, Sergey Ivanovitch always got the better of his brother,
        precisely because Sergey Ivanovitch had definite ideas about the
        peasant&mdash;his character, his qualities, and his tastes. Konstantin
        Levin had no definite and unalterable idea on the subject, and so in
        their arguments Konstantin was readily convicted of contradicting
        himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s eyes his younger brother was a capital
        fellow,
        <i>with his heart in the right place</i> (as he expressed it in French),
        but with a mind which, though fairly quick, was too much influenced by
        the impressions of the moment, and consequently filled with
        contradictions. With all the condescension of an elder brother he
        sometimes explained to him the true import of things, but he derived
        little satisfaction from arguing with him because he got the better of
        him too easily.
      </p>

      <p>
        Konstantin Levin regarded his brother as a man of immense intellect and
        culture, as generous in the highest sense of the word, and possessed of
        a special faculty for working for the public good. But in the depths of
        his heart, the older he became, and the more intimately he knew his
        brother, the more and more frequently the thought struck him that this
        faculty of working for the public good, of which he felt himself utterly
        devoid, was possibly not so much a quality as a lack of
        something&mdash;not a lack of good, honest, noble desires and tastes,
        but a lack of vital force, of what is called heart, of that impulse
        which drives a man to choose someone out of the innumerable paths of
        life, and to care only for that one. The better he knew his brother, the
        more he noticed that Sergey Ivanovitch, and many other people who worked
        for the public welfare, were not led by an impulse of the heart to care
        for the public good, but reasoned from intellectual considerations that
        it was a right thing to take interest in public affairs, and
        consequently took interest in them. Levin was confirmed in this
        generalization by observing that his brother did not take questions
        affecting the public welfare or the question of the immortality of the
        soul a bit more to heart than he did chess problems, or the ingenious
        construction of a new machine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides this, Konstantin Levin was not at his ease with his brother,
        because in summer in the country Levin was continually busy with work on
        the land, and the long summer day was not long enough for him to get
        through all he had to do, while Sergey Ivanovitch was taking a holiday.
        But though he was taking a holiday now, that is to say, he was doing no
        writing, he was so used to intellectual activity that he liked to put
        into concise and eloquent shape the ideas that occurred to him, and
        liked to have someone to listen to him. His most usual and natural
        listener was his brother. And so in spite of the friendliness and
        directness of their relations, Konstantin felt an awkwardness in leaving
        him alone. Sergey Ivanovitch liked to stretch himself on the grass in
        the sun, and to lie so, basking and chatting lazily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; he would say to his brother,
        &ldquo;what a pleasure this rural laziness is to me. Not an idea in
        one&rsquo;s brain, as empty as a drum!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But Konstantin Levin found it dull sitting and listening to him,
        especially when he knew that while he was away they would be carting
        dung onto the fields not ploughed ready for it, and heaping it all up
        anyhow; and would not screw the shares in the ploughs, but would let
        them come off and then say that the new ploughs were a silly invention,
        and there was nothing like the old Andreevna plough, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, you&rsquo;ve done enough trudging about in the heat,&rdquo;
        Sergey Ivanovitch would say to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I must just run round to the counting-house for a
        minute,&rdquo; Levin would answer, and he would run off to the fields.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

      <p>
        Early in June it happened that Agafea Mihalovna, the old nurse and
        housekeeper, in carrying to the cellar a jar of mushrooms she had just
        pickled, slipped, fell, and sprained her wrist. The district doctor, a
        talkative young medical student, who had just finished his studies, came
        to see her. He examined the wrist, said it was not broken, was delighted
        at a chance of talking to the celebrated Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev,
        and to show his advanced views of things told him all the scandal of the
        district, complaining of the poor state into which the district council
        had fallen. Sergey Ivanovitch listened attentively, asked him questions,
        and, roused by a new listener, he talked fluently, uttered a few keen
        and weighty observations, respectfully appreciated by the young doctor,
        and was soon in that eager frame of mind his brother knew so well, which
        always, with him, followed a brilliant and eager conversation. After the
        departure of the doctor, he wanted to go with a fishing rod to the
        river. Sergey Ivanovitch was fond of angling, and was, it seemed, proud
        of being able to care for such a stupid occupation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Konstantin Levin, whose presence was needed in the plough land and
        meadows, had come to take his brother in the trap.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was that time of the year, the turning-point of summer, when the
        crops of the present year are a certainty, when one begins to think of
        the sowing for next year, and the mowing is at hand; when the rye is all
        in ear, though its ears are still light, not yet full, and it waves in
        gray-green billows in the wind; when the green oats, with tufts of
        yellow grass scattered here and there among it, droop irregularly over
        the late-sown fields; when the early buckwheat is already out and hiding
        the ground; when the fallow lands, trodden hard as stone by the cattle,
        are half ploughed over, with paths left untouched by the plough; when
        from the dry dung-heaps carted onto the fields there comes at sunset a
        smell of manure mixed with meadow-sweet, and on the low-lying lands the
        riverside meadows are a thick sea of grass waiting for the mowing, with
        blackened heaps of the stalks of sorrel among it.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was the time when there comes a brief pause in the toil of the fields
        before the beginning of the labors of harvest&mdash;every year
        recurring, every year straining every nerve of the peasants. The crop
        was a splendid one, and bright, hot summer days had set in with short,
        dewy nights.
      </p>

      <p>
        The brothers had to drive through the woods to reach the meadows. Sergey
        Ivanovitch was all the while admiring the beauty of the woods, which
        were a tangled mass of leaves, pointing out to his brother now an old
        lime tree on the point of flowering, dark on the shady side, and
        brightly spotted with yellow stipules, now the young shoots of this
        year&rsquo;s saplings brilliant with emerald. Konstantin Levin did not
        like talking and hearing about the beauty of nature. Words for him took
        away the beauty of what he saw. He assented to what his brother said,
        but he could not help beginning to think of other things. When they came
        out of the woods, all his attention was engrossed by the view of the
        fallow land on the upland, in parts yellow with grass, in parts trampled
        and checkered with furrows, in parts dotted with ridges of dung, and in
        parts even ploughed. A string of carts was moving across it. Levin
        counted the carts, and was pleased that all that were wanted had been
        brought, and at the sight of the meadows his thoughts passed to the
        mowing. He always felt something special moving him to the quick at the
        hay-making. On reaching the meadow Levin stopped the horse.
      </p>

      <p>
        The morning dew was still lying on the thick undergrowth of the grass,
        and that he might not get his feet wet, Sergey Ivanovitch asked his
        brother to drive him in the trap up to the willow tree from which the
        carp was caught. Sorry as Konstantin Levin was to crush down his mowing
        grass, he drove him into the meadow. The high grass softly turned about
        the wheels and the horse&rsquo;s legs, leaving its seeds clinging to the
        wet axles and spokes of the wheels. His brother seated himself under a
        bush, arranging his tackle, while Levin led the horse away, fastened him
        up, and walked into the vast gray-green sea of grass unstirred by the
        wind. The silky grass with its ripe seeds came almost to his waist in
        the dampest spots.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crossing the meadow, Konstantin Levin came out onto the road, and met an
        old man with a swollen eye, carrying a skep on his shoulder.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What? taken a stray swarm, Fomitch?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, indeed, Konstantin Dmitrich! All we can do to keep our own!
        This is the second swarm that has flown away.... Luckily the lads caught
        them. They were ploughing your field. They unyoked the horses and
        galloped after them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what do you say, Fomitch&mdash;start mowing or wait a
        bit?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Eh, well. Our way&rsquo;s to wait till St. Peter&rsquo;s Day. But
        you always mow sooner. Well, to be sure, please God, the hay&rsquo;s
        good. There&rsquo;ll be plenty for the beasts.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you think about the weather?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s in God&rsquo;s hands. Maybe it will be fine.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin went up to his brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch had caught nothing, but he was not bored, and seemed
        in the most cheerful frame of mind. Levin saw that, stimulated by his
        conversation with the doctor, he wanted to talk. Levin, on the other
        hand, would have liked to get home as soon as possible to give orders
        about getting together the mowers for next day, and to set at rest his
        doubts about the mowing, which greatly absorbed him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s be going,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why be in such a hurry? Let&rsquo;s stay a little. But how wet
        you are! Even though one catches nothing, it&rsquo;s nice. That&rsquo;s
        the best thing about every part of sport, that one has to do with
        nature. How exquisite this steely water is!&rdquo; said Sergey
        Ivanovitch. &ldquo;These riverside banks always remind me of the
        riddle&mdash;do you know it? &lsquo;The grass says to the water: we
        quiver and we quiver.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the riddle,&rdquo; answered Levin wearily.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 3</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about you,&rdquo; said
        Sergey Ivanovitch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beyond everything what&rsquo;s
        being done in the district, according to what this doctor tells me.
        He&rsquo;s a very intelligent fellow. And as I&rsquo;ve told you before,
        I tell you again: it&rsquo;s not right for you not to go to the
        meetings, and altogether to keep out of the district business. If decent
        people won&rsquo;t go into it, of course it&rsquo;s bound to go all
        wrong. We pay the money, and it all goes in salaries, and there are no
        schools, nor district nurses, nor midwives, nor
        drugstores&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I did try, you know,&rdquo; Levin said slowly and
        unwillingly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t! and so there&rsquo;s no help for
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But why can&rsquo;t you? I must own I can&rsquo;t make it out.
        Indifference, incapacity&mdash;I won&rsquo;t admit; surely it&rsquo;s
        not simply laziness?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;None of those things. I&rsquo;ve tried, and I see I can do
        nothing,&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had hardly grasped what his brother was saying. Looking towards the
        plough land across the river, he made out something black, but he could
        not distinguish whether it was a horse or the bailiff on horseback.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why is it you can do nothing? You made an attempt and
        didn&rsquo;t succeed, as you think, and you give in. How can you have so
        little self-respect?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Self-respect!&rdquo; said Levin, stung to the quick by his
        brother&rsquo;s words; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. If they&rsquo;d
        told me at college that other people understood the integral calculus,
        and I didn&rsquo;t, then pride would have come in. But in this case one
        wants first to be convinced that one has certain qualifications for this
        sort of business, and especially that all this business is of great
        importance.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What! do you mean to say it&rsquo;s not of importance?&rdquo;
        said Sergey Ivanovitch, stung to the quick too at his brother&rsquo;s
        considering anything of no importance that interested him, and still
        more at his obviously paying little attention to what he was saying.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it important; it does not take hold of me, I
        can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; answered Levin, making out that what he saw
        was the bailiff, and that the bailiff seemed to be letting the peasants
        go off the ploughed land. They were turning the plough over. &ldquo;Can
        they have finished ploughing?&rdquo; he wondered.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, really though,&rdquo; said the elder brother, with a frown
        on his handsome, clever face, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a limit to
        everything. It&rsquo;s very well to be original and genuine, and to
        dislike everything conventional&mdash;I know all about that; but really,
        what you&rsquo;re saying either has no meaning, or it has a very wrong
        meaning. How can you think it a matter of no importance whether the
        peasant, whom you love as you assert....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I never did assert it,&rdquo; thought Konstantin Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;...dies without help? The ignorant peasant-women starve the
        children, and the people stagnate in darkness, and are helpless in the
        hands of every village clerk, while you have at your disposal a means of
        helping them, and don&rsquo;t help them because to your mind it&rsquo;s
        of no importance.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Sergey Ivanovitch put before him the alternative: either you are so
        undeveloped that you can&rsquo;t see all that you can do, or you
        won&rsquo;t sacrifice your ease, your vanity, or whatever it is, to do
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Konstantin Levin felt that there was no course open to him but to
        submit, or to confess to a lack of zeal for the public good. And this
        mortified him and hurt his feelings.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s both,&rdquo; he said resolutely: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
        see that it was possible....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What! was it impossible, if the money were properly laid out, to
        provide medical aid?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Impossible, as it seems to me.... For the three thousand square
        miles of our district, what with our thaws, and the storms, and the work
        in the fields, I don&rsquo;t see how it is possible to provide medical
        aid all over. And besides, I don&rsquo;t believe in medicine.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, that&rsquo;s unfair ... I can quote to you thousands of
        instances.... But the schools, anyway.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why have schools?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you mean? Can there be two opinions of the advantage of
        education? If it&rsquo;s a good thing for you, it&rsquo;s a good thing
        for everyone.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Konstantin Levin felt himself morally pinned against a wall, and so he
        got hot, and unconsciously blurted out the chief cause of his
        indifference to public business.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps it may all be very good; but why should I worry myself
        about establishing dispensaries which I shall never make use of, and
        schools to which I shall never send my children, to which even the
        peasants don&rsquo;t want to send their children, and to which
        I&rsquo;ve no very firm faith that they ought to send them?&rdquo; said
        he.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch was for a minute surprised at this unexpected view of
        the subject; but he promptly made a new plan of attack. He was silent
        for a little, drew out a hook, threw it in again, and turned to his
        brother smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, now.... In the first place, the dispensary is needed. We
        ourselves sent for the district doctor for Agafea Mihalovna.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, but I fancy her wrist will never be straight
        again.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That remains to be proved.... Next, the peasant who can read and
        write is as a workman of more use and value to you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, you can ask anyone you like,&rdquo; Konstantin Levin answered
        with decision, &ldquo;the man that can read and write is much inferior
        as a workman. And mending the highroads is an impossibility; and as soon
        as they put up bridges they&rsquo;re stolen.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Still, that&rsquo;s not the point,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch,
        frowning. He disliked contradiction, and still more, arguments that were
        continually skipping from one thing to another, introducing new and
        disconnected points, so that there was no knowing to which to reply.
        &ldquo;Do you admit that education is a benefit for the people?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I admit it,&rdquo; said Levin without thinking, and he was
        conscious immediately that he had said what he did not think. He felt
        that if he admitted that, it would be proved that he had been talking
        meaningless rubbish. How it would be proved he could not tell, but he
        knew that this would inevitably be logically proved to him, and he
        awaited the proofs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The argument turned out to be far simpler than he had expected.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you admit that it is a benefit,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch,
        &ldquo;then, as an honest man, you cannot help caring about it and
        sympathizing with the movement, and so wishing to work for it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I still do not admit this movement to be just,&rdquo; said
        Konstantin Levin, reddening a little.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What! But you said just now....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s to say, I don&rsquo;t admit it&rsquo;s being either
        good or possible.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That you can&rsquo;t tell without making the trial.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, supposing that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Levin, though he did
        not suppose so at all, &ldquo;supposing that is so, still I don&rsquo;t
        see, all the same, what I&rsquo;m to worry myself about it for.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; since we are talking, explain it to me from the philosophical
        point of view,&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see where philosophy comes in,&rdquo; said Sergey
        Ivanovitch, in a tone, Levin fancied, as though he did not admit his
        brother&rsquo;s right to talk about philosophy. And that irritated
        Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, then,&rdquo; he said with heat, &ldquo;I
        imagine the mainspring of all our actions is, after all, self-interest.
        Now in the local institutions I, as a nobleman, see nothing that could
        conduce to my prosperity, and the roads are not better and could not be
        better; my horses carry me well enough over bad ones. Doctors and
        dispensaries are no use to me. An arbitrator of disputes is no use to
        me. I never appeal to him, and never shall appeal to him. The schools
        are no good to me, but positively harmful, as I told you. For me the
        district institutions simply mean the liability to pay fourpence
        halfpenny for every three acres, to drive into the town, sleep with
        bugs, and listen to all sorts of idiocy and loathsomeness, and
        self-interest offers me no inducement.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; Sergey Ivanovitch interposed with a smile,
        &ldquo;self-interest did not induce us to work for the emancipation of
        the serfs, but we did work for it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Konstantin Levin broke in with still greater heat;
        &ldquo;the emancipation of the serfs was a different matter. There
        self-interest did come in. One longed to throw off that yoke that
        crushed us, all decent people among us. But to be a town councilor and
        discuss how many dustmen are needed, and how chimneys shall be
        constructed in the town in which I don&rsquo;t live&mdash;to serve on a
        jury and try a peasant who&rsquo;s stolen a flitch of bacon, and listen
        for six hours at a stretch to all sorts of jabber from the counsel for
        the defense and the prosecution, and the president cross-examining my
        old half-witted Alioshka, &lsquo;Do you admit, prisoner in the dock, the
        fact of the removal of the bacon?&rsquo; &lsquo;Eh?&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Konstantin Levin had warmed to his subject, and began mimicking the
        president and the half-witted Alioshka: it seemed to him that it was all
        to the point.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Sergey Ivanovitch shrugged his shoulders.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what do you mean to say, then?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I simply mean to say that those rights that touch me ... my
        interest, I shall always defend to the best of my ability; that when
        they made raids on us students, and the police read our letters, I was
        ready to defend those rights to the utmost, to defend my rights to
        education and freedom. I can understand compulsory military service,
        which affects my children, my brothers, and myself, I am ready to
        deliberate on what concerns me; but deliberating on how to spend forty
        thousand roubles of district council money, or judging the half-witted
        Alioshka&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand, and I can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Konstantin Levin spoke as though the floodgates of his speech had burst
        open. Sergey Ivanovitch smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But tomorrow it&rsquo;ll be your turn to be tried; would it have
        suited your tastes better to be tried in the old criminal
        tribunal?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be tried. I shan&rsquo;t murder anybody,
        and I&rsquo;ve no need of it. Well, I tell you what,&rdquo; he went on,
        flying off again to a subject quite beside the point, &ldquo;our
        district self-government and all the rest of it&mdash;it&rsquo;s just
        like the birch branches we stick in the ground on Trinity Day, for
        instance, to look like a copse which has grown up of itself in Europe,
        and I can&rsquo;t gush over these birch branches and believe in
        them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch merely shrugged his shoulders, as though to express
        his wonder how the birch branches had come into their argument at that
        point, though he did really understand at once what his brother meant.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, but you know one really can&rsquo;t argue in that
        way,&rdquo; he observed.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Konstantin Levin wanted to justify himself for the failing, of which
        he was conscious, of lack of zeal for the public welfare, and he went
        on.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I imagine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that no sort of activity is
        likely to be lasting if it is not founded on self-interest, that&rsquo;s
        a universal principle, a philosophical principle,&rdquo; he said,
        repeating the word &ldquo;philosophical&rdquo; with determination, as
        though wishing to show that he had as much right as anyone else to talk
        of philosophy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch smiled. &ldquo;He too has a philosophy of his own at
        the service of his natural tendencies,&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, you&rsquo;d better let philosophy alone,&rdquo; he said.
        &ldquo;The chief problem of the philosophy of all ages consists just in
        finding the indispensable connection which exists between individual and
        social interests. But that&rsquo;s not to the point; what is to the
        point is a correction I must make in your comparison. The birches are
        not simply stuck in, but some are sown and some are planted, and one
        must deal carefully with them. It&rsquo;s only those peoples that have
        an intuitive sense of what&rsquo;s of importance and significance in
        their institutions, and know how to value them, that have a future
        before them&mdash;it&rsquo;s only those peoples that one can truly call
        historical.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Sergey Ivanovitch carried the subject into the regions of
        philosophical history where Konstantin Levin could not follow him, and
        showed him all the incorrectness of his view.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;As for your dislike of it, excuse my saying so, that&rsquo;s
        simply our Russian sloth and old serf-owner&rsquo;s ways, and I&rsquo;m
        convinced that in you it&rsquo;s a temporary error and will pass.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Konstantin was silent. He felt himself vanquished on all sides, but he
        felt at the same time that what he wanted to say was unintelligible to
        his brother. Only he could not make up his mind whether it was
        unintelligible because he was not capable of expressing his meaning
        clearly, or because his brother would not or could not understand him.
        But he did not pursue the speculation, and without replying, he fell to
        musing on a quite different and personal matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch wound up the last line, untied the horse, and they
        drove off.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 4</h3>

      <p>
        The personal matter that absorbed Levin during his conversation with his
        brother was this. Once in a previous year he had gone to look at the
        mowing, and being made very angry by the bailiff he had recourse to his
        favorite means for regaining his temper,&mdash;he took a scythe from a
        peasant and began mowing.
      </p>

      <p>
        He liked the work so much that he had several times tried his hand at
        mowing since. He had cut the whole of the meadow in front of his house,
        and this year ever since the early spring he had cherished a plan for
        mowing for whole days together with the peasants. Ever since his
        brother&rsquo;s arrival, he had been in doubt whether to mow or not. He
        was loath to leave his brother alone all day long, and he was afraid his
        brother would laugh at him about it. But as he drove into the meadow,
        and recalled the sensations of mowing, he came near deciding that he
        would go mowing. After the irritating discussion with his brother, he
        pondered over this intention again.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I must have physical exercise, or my temper&rsquo;ll certainly be
        ruined,&rdquo; he thought, and he determined he would go mowing, however
        awkward he might feel about it with his brother or the peasants.
      </p>

      <p>
        Towards evening Konstantin Levin went to his counting house, gave
        directions as to the work to be done, and sent about the village to
        summon the mowers for the morrow, to cut the hay in Kalinov meadow, the
        largest and best of his grass lands.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And send my scythe, please, to Tit, for him to set it, and bring
        it round tomorrow. I shall maybe do some mowing myself too,&rdquo; he
        said, trying not to be embarrassed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bailiff smiled and said: &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At tea the same evening Levin said to his brother:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I fancy the fine weather will last. Tomorrow I shall start
        mowing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so fond of that form of field labor,&rdquo; said Sergey
        Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully fond of it. I sometimes mow myself with the
        peasants, and tomorrow I want to try mowing the whole day.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch lifted his head, and looked with interest at his
        brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you mean? Just like one of the peasants, all day
        long?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very pleasant,&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s splendid as exercise, only you&rsquo;ll hardly be able
        to stand it,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch, without a shade of irony.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried it. It&rsquo;s hard work at first, but you get
        into it. I dare say I shall manage to keep it up....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Really! what an idea! But tell me, how do the peasants look at
        it? I suppose they laugh in their sleeves at their master&rsquo;s being
        such a queer fish?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so; but it&rsquo;s so delightful, and at
        the same time such hard work, that one has no time to think about
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But how will you do about dining with them? To send you a bottle
        of Lafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll simply come home at the time of their noonday
        rest.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Next morning Konstantin Levin got up earlier than usual, but he was
        detained giving directions on the farm, and when he reached the mowing
        grass the mowers were already at their second row.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the uplands he could get a view of the shaded cut part of the
        meadow below, with its grayish ridges of cut grass, and the black heaps
        of coats, taken off by the mowers at the place from which they had
        started cutting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gradually, as he rode towards the meadow, the peasants came into sight,
        some in coats, some in their shirts mowing, one behind another in a long
        string, swinging their scythes differently. He counted forty-two of
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        They were mowing slowly over the uneven, low-lying parts of the meadow,
        where there had been an old dam. Levin recognized some of his own men.
        Here was old Yermil in a very long white smock, bending forward to swing
        a scythe; there was a young fellow, Vaska, who had been a coachman of
        Levin&rsquo;s, taking every row with a wide sweep. Here, too, was Tit,
        Levin&rsquo;s preceptor in the art of mowing, a thin little peasant. He
        was in front of all, and cut his wide row without bending, as though
        playing with the scythe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin got off his mare, and fastening her up by the roadside went to
        meet Tit, who took a second scythe out of a bush and gave it to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ready, sir; it&rsquo;s like a razor, cuts of
        itself,&rdquo; said Tit, taking off his cap with a smile and giving him
        the scythe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin took the scythe, and began trying it. As they finished their rows,
        the mowers, hot and good-humored, came out into the road one after
        another, and, laughing a little, greeted the master. They all stared at
        him, but no one made any remark, till a tall old man, with a wrinkled,
        beardless face, wearing a short sheepskin jacket, came out into the road
        and accosted him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Look&rsquo;ee now, master, once take hold of the rope
        there&rsquo;s no letting it go!&rdquo; he said, and Levin heard
        smothered laughter among the mowers.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to let it go,&rdquo; he said, taking his stand
        behind Tit, and waiting for the time to begin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mind&rsquo;ee,&rdquo; repeated the old man.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tit made room, and Levin started behind him. The grass was short close
        to the road, and Levin, who had not done any mowing for a long while,
        and was disconcerted by the eyes fastened upon him, cut badly for the
        first moments, though he swung his scythe vigorously. Behind him he
        heard voices:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not set right; handle&rsquo;s too high; see how he has
        to stoop to it,&rdquo; said one.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Press more on the heel,&rdquo; said another.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Never mind, he&rsquo;ll get on all right,&rdquo; the old man
        resumed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s made a start.... You swing it too wide, you&rsquo;ll
        tire yourself out.... The master, sure, does his best for himself! But
        see the grass missed out! For such work us fellows would catch
        it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The grass became softer, and Levin, listening without answering,
        followed Tit, trying to do the best he could. They moved a hundred
        paces. Tit kept moving on, without stopping, not showing the slightest
        weariness, but Levin was already beginning to be afraid he would not be
        able to keep it up: he was so tired.
      </p>

      <p>
        He felt as he swung his scythe that he was at the very end of his
        strength, and was making up his mind to ask Tit to stop. But at that
        very moment Tit stopped of his own accord, and stooping down picked up
        some grass, rubbed his scythe, and began whetting it. Levin straightened
        himself, and drawing a deep breath looked round. Behind him came a
        peasant, and he too was evidently tired, for he stopped at once without
        waiting to mow up to Levin, and began whetting his scythe. Tit sharpened
        his scythe and Levin&rsquo;s, and they went on. The next time it was
        just the same. Tit moved on with sweep after sweep of his scythe, not
        stopping nor showing signs of weariness. Levin followed him, trying not
        to get left behind, and he found it harder and harder: the moment came
        when he felt he had no strength left, but at that very moment Tit
        stopped and whetted the scythes.
      </p>

      <p>
        So they mowed the first row. And this long row seemed particularly hard
        work to Levin; but when the end was reached and Tit, shouldering his
        scythe, began with deliberate stride returning on the tracks left by his
        heels in the cut grass, and Levin walked back in the same way over the
        space he had cut, in spite of the sweat that ran in streams over his
        face and fell in drops down his nose, and drenched his back as though he
        had been soaked in water, he felt very happy. What delighted him
        particularly was that now he knew he would be able to hold out.
      </p>

      <p>
        His pleasure was only disturbed by his row not being well cut. &ldquo;I
        will swing less with my arm and more with my whole body,&rdquo; he
        thought, comparing Tit&rsquo;s row, which looked as if it had been cut
        with a line, with his own unevenly and irregularly lying grass.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first row, as Levin noticed, Tit had mowed specially quickly,
        probably wishing to put his master to the test, and the row happened to
        be a long one. The next rows were easier, but still Levin had to strain
        every nerve not to drop behind the peasants.
      </p>

      <p>
        He thought of nothing, wished for nothing, but not to be left behind the
        peasants, and to do his work as well as possible. He heard nothing but
        the swish of scythes, and saw before him Tit&rsquo;s upright figure
        mowing away, the crescent-shaped curve of the cut grass, the grass and
        flower heads slowly and rhythmically falling before the blade of his
        scythe, and ahead of him the end of the row, where would come the rest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suddenly, in the midst of his toil, without understanding what it was or
        whence it came, he felt a pleasant sensation of chill on his hot, moist
        shoulders. He glanced at the sky in the interval for whetting the
        scythes. A heavy, lowering storm cloud had blown up, and big raindrops
        were falling. Some of the peasants went to their coats and put them on;
        others&mdash;just like Levin himself&mdash;merely shrugged their
        shoulders, enjoying the pleasant coolness of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another row, and yet another row, followed&mdash;long rows and short
        rows, with good grass and with poor grass. Levin lost all sense of time,
        and could not have told whether it was late or early now. A change began
        to come over his work, which gave him immense satisfaction. In the midst
        of his toil there were moments during which he forgot what he was doing,
        and it came all easy to him, and at those same moments his row was
        almost as smooth and well cut as Tit&rsquo;s. But so soon as he
        recollected what he was doing, and began trying to do better, he was at
        once conscious of all the difficulty of his task, and the row was badly
        mown.
      </p>

      <p>
        On finishing yet another row he would have gone back to the top of the
        meadow again to begin the next, but Tit stopped, and going up to the old
        man said something in a low voice to him. They both looked at the sun.
        &ldquo;What are they talking about, and why doesn&rsquo;t he go
        back?&rdquo; thought Levin, not guessing that the peasants had been
        mowing no less than four hours without stopping, and it was time for
        their lunch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Lunch, sir,&rdquo; said the old man.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it really time? That&rsquo;s right; lunch, then.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin gave his scythe to Tit, and together with the peasants, who were
        crossing the long stretch of mown grass, slightly sprinkled with rain,
        to get their bread from the heap of coats, he went towards his house.
        Only then he suddenly awoke to the fact that he had been wrong about the
        weather and the rain was drenching his hay.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The hay will be spoiled,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not a bit of it, sir; mow in the rain, and you&rsquo;ll rake in
        fine weather!&rdquo; said the old man.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee. Sergey Ivanovitch
        was only just getting up. When he had drunk his coffee, Levin rode back
        again to the mowing before Sergey Ivanovitch had had time to dress and
        come down to the dining-room.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 5</h3>

      <p>
        After lunch Levin was not in the same place in the string of mowers as
        before, but stood between the old man who had accosted him jocosely, and
        now invited him to be his neighbor, and a young peasant, who had only
        been married in the autumn, and who was mowing this summer for the first
        time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The old man, holding himself erect, moved in front, with his feet turned
        out, taking long, regular strides, and with a precise and regular action
        which seemed to cost him no more effort than swinging one&rsquo;s arms
        in walking, as though it were in play, he laid down the high, even row
        of grass. It was as though it were not he but the sharp scythe of itself
        swishing through the juicy grass.
      </p>

      <p>
        Behind Levin came the lad Mishka. His pretty, boyish face, with a twist
        of fresh grass bound round his hair, was all working with effort; but
        whenever anyone looked at him he smiled. He would clearly have died
        sooner than own it was hard work for him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin kept between them. In the very heat of the day the mowing did not
        seem such hard work to him. The perspiration with which he was drenched
        cooled him, while the sun, that burned his back, his head, and his arms,
        bare to the elbow, gave a vigor and dogged energy to his labor; and more
        and more often now came those moments of unconsciousness, when it was
        possible not to think what one was doing. The scythe cut of itself.
        These were happy moments. Still more delightful were the moments when
        they reached the stream where the rows ended, and the old man rubbed his
        scythe with the wet, thick grass, rinsed its blade in the fresh water of
        the stream, ladled out a little in a tin dipper, and offered Levin a
        drink.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you say to my home-brew, eh? Good, eh?&rdquo; said he,
        winking.
      </p>

      <p>
        And truly Levin had never drunk any liquor so good as this warm water
        with green bits floating in it, and a taste of rust from the tin dipper.
        And immediately after this came the delicious, slow saunter, with his
        hand on the scythe, during which he could wipe away the streaming sweat,
        take deep breaths of air, and look about at the long string of mowers
        and at what was happening around in the forest and the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        The longer Levin mowed, the oftener he felt the moments of
        unconsciousness in which it seemed not his hands that swung the scythe,
        but the scythe mowing of itself, a body full of life and consciousness
        of its own, and as though by magic, without thinking of it, the work
        turned out regular and well-finished of itself. These were the most
        blissful moments.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was only hard work when he had to break off the motion, which had
        become unconscious, and to think; when he had to mow round a hillock or
        a tuft of sorrel. The old man did this easily. When a hillock came he
        changed his action, and at one time with the heel, and at another with
        the tip of his scythe, clipped the hillock round both sides with short
        strokes. And while he did this he kept looking about and watching what
        came into his view: at one moment he picked a wild berry and ate it or
        offered it to Levin, then he flung away a twig with the blade of the
        scythe, then he looked at a quail&rsquo;s nest, from which the bird flew
        just under the scythe, or caught a snake that crossed his path, and
        lifting it on the scythe as though on a fork showed it to Levin and
        threw it away.
      </p>

      <p>
        For both Levin and the young peasant behind him, such changes of
        position were difficult. Both of them, repeating over and over again the
        same strained movement, were in a perfect frenzy of toil, and were
        incapable of shifting their position and at the same time watching what
        was before them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin did not notice how time was passing. If he had been asked how long
        he had been working he would have said half an hour&mdash;and it was
        getting on for dinner time. As they were walking back over the cut
        grass, the old man called Levin&rsquo;s attention to the little girls
        and boys who were coming from different directions, hardly visible
        through the long grass, and along the road towards the mowers, carrying
        sacks of bread dragging at their little hands and pitchers of the sour
        rye-beer, with cloths wrapped round them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Look&rsquo;ee, the little emmets crawling!&rdquo; he said,
        pointing to them, and he shaded his eyes with his hand to look at the
        sun. They mowed two more rows; the old man stopped.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, master, dinner time!&rdquo; he said briskly. And on
        reaching the stream the mowers moved off across the lines of cut grass
        towards their pile of coats, where the children who had brought their
        dinners were sitting waiting for them. The peasants gathered into
        groups&mdash;those further away under a cart, those nearer under a
        willow bush.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin sat down by them; he felt disinclined to go away.
      </p>

      <p>
        All constraint with the master had disappeared long ago. The peasants
        got ready for dinner. Some washed, the young lads bathed in the stream,
        others made a place comfortable for a rest, untied their sacks of bread,
        and uncovered the pitchers of rye-beer. The old man crumbled up some
        bread in a cup, stirred it with the handle of a spoon, poured water on
        it from the dipper, broke up some more bread, and having seasoned it
        with salt, he turned to the east to say his prayer.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, master, taste my sop,&rdquo; said he, kneeling down before
        the cup.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sop was so good that Levin gave up the idea of going home. He dined
        with the old man, and talked to him about his family affairs, taking the
        keenest interest in them, and told him about his own affairs and all the
        circumstances that could be of interest to the old man. He felt much
        nearer to him than to his brother, and could not help smiling at the
        affection he felt for this man. When the old man got up again, said his
        prayer, and lay down under a bush, putting some grass under his head for
        a pillow, Levin did the same, and in spite of the clinging flies that
        were so persistent in the sunshine, and the midges that tickled his hot
        face and body, he fell asleep at once and only waked when the sun had
        passed to the other side of the bush and reached him. The old man had
        been awake a long while, and was sitting up whetting the scythes of the
        younger lads.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin looked about him and hardly recognized the place, everything was
        so changed. The immense stretch of meadow had been mown and was
        sparkling with a peculiar fresh brilliance, with its lines of already
        sweet-smelling grass in the slanting rays of the evening sun. And the
        bushes about the river had been cut down, and the river itself, not
        visible before, now gleaming like steel in its bends, and the moving,
        ascending, peasants, and the sharp wall of grass of the unmown part of
        the meadow, and the hawks hovering over the stripped meadow&mdash;all
        was perfectly new. Raising himself, Levin began considering how much had
        been cut and how much more could still be done that day.
      </p>

      <p>
        The work done was exceptionally much for forty-two men. They had cut the
        whole of the big meadow, which had, in the years of serf labor, taken
        thirty scythes two days to mow. Only the corners remained to do, where
        the rows were short. But Levin felt a longing to get as much mowing done
        that day as possible, and was vexed with the sun sinking so quickly in
        the sky. He felt no weariness; all he wanted was to get his work done
        more and more quickly and as much done as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Could you cut Mashkin Upland too?&mdash;what do you think?&rdquo;
        he said to the old man.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;As God wills, the sun&rsquo;s not high. A little vodka for the
        lads?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At the afternoon rest, when they were sitting down again, and those who
        smoked had lighted their pipes, the old man told the men that
        &ldquo;Mashkin Upland&rsquo;s to be cut&mdash;there&rsquo;ll be some
        vodka.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why not cut it? Come on, Tit! We&rsquo;ll look sharp! We can eat
        at night. Come on!&rdquo; cried voices, and eating up their bread, the
        mowers went back to work.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, lads, keep it up!&rdquo; said Tit, and ran on ahead almost
        at a trot.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Get along, get along!&rdquo; said the old man, hurrying after him
        and easily overtaking him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mow you down, look
        out!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And young and old mowed away, as though they were racing with one
        another. But however fast they worked, they did not spoil the grass, and
        the rows were laid just as neatly and exactly. The little piece left
        uncut in the corner was mown in five minutes. The last of the mowers
        were just ending their rows while the foremost snatched up their coats
        onto their shoulders, and crossed the road towards Mashkin Upland.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sun was already sinking into the trees when they went with their
        jingling dippers into the wooded ravine of Mashkin Upland. The grass was
        up to their waists in the middle of the hollow, soft, tender, and
        feathery, spotted here and there among the trees with wild
        heart&rsquo;s-ease.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a brief consultation&mdash;whether to take the rows lengthwise or
        diagonally&mdash;Prohor Yermilin, also a renowned mower, a huge,
        black-haired peasant, went on ahead. He went up to the top, turned back
        again and started mowing, and they all proceeded to form in line behind
        him, going downhill through the hollow and uphill right up to the edge
        of the forest. The sun sank behind the forest. The dew was falling by
        now; the mowers were in the sun only on the hillside, but below, where a
        mist was rising, and on the opposite side, they mowed into the fresh,
        dewy shade. The work went rapidly. The grass cut with a juicy sound, and
        was at once laid in high, fragrant rows. The mowers from all sides,
        brought closer together in the short row, kept urging one another on to
        the sound of jingling dippers and clanging scythes, and the hiss of the
        whetstones sharpening them, and good-humored shouts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin still kept between the young peasant and the old man. The old man,
        who had put on his short sheepskin jacket, was just as good-humored,
        jocose, and free in his movements. Among the trees they were continually
        cutting with their scythes the so-called &ldquo;birch mushrooms,&rdquo;
        swollen fat in the succulent grass. But the old man bent down every time
        he came across a mushroom, picked it up and put it in his bosom.
        &ldquo;Another present for my old woman,&rdquo; he said as he did so.
      </p>

      <p>
        Easy as it was to mow the wet, soft grass, it was hard work going up and
        down the steep sides of the ravine. But this did not trouble the old
        man. Swinging his scythe just as ever, and moving his feet in their big,
        plaited shoes with firm, little steps, he climbed slowly up the steep
        place, and though his breeches hanging out below his smock, and his
        whole frame trembled with effort, he did not miss one blade of grass or
        one mushroom on his way, and kept making jokes with the peasants and
        Levin. Levin walked after him and often thought he must fall, as he
        climbed with a scythe up a steep cliff where it would have been hard
        work to clamber without anything. But he climbed up and did what he had
        to do. He felt as though some external force were moving him.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 6</h3>

      <p>
        Mashkin Upland was mown, the last row finished, the peasants had put on
        their coats and were gaily trudging home. Levin got on his horse and,
        parting regretfully from the peasants, rode homewards. On the hillside
        he looked back; he could not see them in the mist that had risen from
        the valley; he could only hear rough, good-humored voices, laughter, and
        the sound of clanking scythes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch had long ago finished dinner, and was drinking iced
        lemon and water in his own room, looking through the reviews and papers
        which he had only just received by post, when Levin rushed into the
        room, talking merrily, with his wet and matted hair sticking to his
        forehead, and his back and chest grimed and moist.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We mowed the whole meadow! Oh, it is nice, delicious! And how
        have you been getting on?&rdquo; said Levin, completely forgetting the
        disagreeable conversation of the previous day.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mercy! what do you look like!&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch, for
        the first moment looking round with some dissatisfaction. &ldquo;And the
        door, do shut the door!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You must have let in a
        dozen at least.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch could not endure flies, and in his own room he never
        opened the window except at night, and carefully kept the door shut.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not one, on my honor. But if I have, I&rsquo;ll catch them. You
        wouldn&rsquo;t believe what a pleasure it is! How have you spent the
        day?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well. But have you really been mowing the whole day? I
        expect you&rsquo;re as hungry as a wolf. Kouzma has got everything ready
        for you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t feel hungry even. I had something to eat there.
        But I&rsquo;ll go and wash.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, go along, go along, and I&rsquo;ll come to you
        directly,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch, shaking his head as he looked
        at his brother. &ldquo;Go along, make haste,&rdquo; he added smiling,
        and gathering up his books, he prepared to go too. He, too, felt
        suddenly good-humored and disinclined to leave his brother&rsquo;s side.
        &ldquo;But what did you do while it was raining?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Rain? Why, there was scarcely a drop. I&rsquo;ll come directly.
        So you had a nice day too? That&rsquo;s first-rate.&rdquo; And Levin
        went off to change his clothes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Five minutes later the brothers met in the dining-room. Although it
        seemed to Levin that he was not hungry, and he sat down to dinner simply
        so as not to hurt Kouzma&rsquo;s feelings, yet when he began to eat the
        dinner struck him as extraordinarily good. Sergey Ivanovitch watched him
        with a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, by the way, there&rsquo;s a letter for you,&rdquo; said he.
        &ldquo;Kouzma, bring it down, please. And mind you shut the
        doors.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The letter was from Oblonsky. Levin read it aloud. Oblonsky wrote to him
        from Petersburg: &ldquo;I have had a letter from Dolly; she&rsquo;s at
        Ergushovo, and everything seems going wrong there. Do ride over and see
        her, please; help her with advice; you know all about it. She will be so
        glad to see you. She&rsquo;s quite alone, poor thing. My mother-in-law
        and all of them are still abroad.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s capital! I will certainly ride over to her,&rdquo;
        said Levin. &ldquo;Or we&rsquo;ll go together. She&rsquo;s such a
        splendid woman, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not far from here, then?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Twenty-five miles. Or perhaps it is thirty. But a capital road.
        Capital, we&rsquo;ll drive over.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall be delighted,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch, still
        smiling. The sight of his younger brother&rsquo;s appearance had
        immediately put him in a good humor.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you have an appetite!&rdquo; he said, looking at his
        dark-red, sunburnt face and neck bent over the plate.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Splendid! You can&rsquo;t imagine what an effectual remedy it is
        for every sort of foolishness. I want to enrich medicine with a new
        word:
        <i>Arbeitskur</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, but you don&rsquo;t need it, I should fancy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, but for all sorts of nervous invalids.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it ought to be tried. I had meant to come to the mowing to
        look at you, but it was so unbearably hot that I got no further than the
        forest. I sat there a little, and went on by the forest to the village,
        met your old nurse, and sounded her as to the peasants&rsquo; view of
        you. As far as I can make out, they don&rsquo;t approve of this. She
        said: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not a gentleman&rsquo;s work.&rsquo; Altogether,
        I fancy that in the people&rsquo;s ideas there are very clear and
        definite notions of certain, as they call it, &lsquo;gentlemanly&rsquo;
        lines of action. And they don&rsquo;t sanction the gentry&rsquo;s moving
        outside bounds clearly laid down in their ideas.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Maybe so; but anyway it&rsquo;s a pleasure such as I have never
        known in my life. And there&rsquo;s no harm in it, you know. Is
        there?&rdquo; answered Levin. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it if they
        don&rsquo;t like it. Though I do believe it&rsquo;s all right.
        Eh?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Altogether,&rdquo; pursued Sergey Ivanovitch, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
        satisfied with your day?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Quite satisfied. We cut the whole meadow. And such a splendid old
        man I made friends with there! You can&rsquo;t fancy how delightful he
        was!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, so you&rsquo;re content with your day. And so am I. First,
        I solved two chess problems, and one a very pretty one&mdash;a pawn
        opening. I&rsquo;ll show it you. And then&mdash;I thought over our
        conversation yesterday.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Eh! our conversation yesterday?&rdquo; said Levin, blissfully
        dropping his eyelids and drawing deep breaths after finishing his
        dinner, and absolutely incapable of recalling what their conversation
        yesterday was about.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think you are partly right. Our difference of opinion amounts
        to this, that you make the mainspring self-interest, while I suppose
        that interest in the common weal is bound to exist in every man of a
        certain degree of advancement. Possibly you are right too, that action
        founded on material interest would be more desirable. You are
        altogether, as the French say, too
        <i>primesautière</i> a nature; you must have intense, energetic action,
        or nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin listened to his brother and did not understand a single word, and
        did not want to understand. He was only afraid his brother might ask him
        some question which would make it evident he had not heard.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what I think it is, my dear boy,&rdquo; said
        Sergey Ivanovitch, touching him on the shoulder.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, of course. But, do you know? I won&rsquo;t stand up for my
        view,&rdquo; answered Levin, with a guilty, childlike smile.
        &ldquo;Whatever was it I was disputing about?&rdquo; he wondered.
        &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m right, and he&rsquo;s right, and it&rsquo;s
        all first-rate. Only I must go round to the counting house and see to
        things.&rdquo; He got up, stretching and smiling. Sergey Ivanovitch
        smiled too.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you want to go out, let&rsquo;s go together,&rdquo; he said,
        disinclined to be parted from his brother, who seemed positively
        breathing out freshness and energy. &ldquo;Come, we&rsquo;ll go to the
        counting house, if you have to go there.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, heavens!&rdquo; shouted Levin, so loudly that Sergey
        Ivanovitch was quite frightened.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What, what is the matter?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Agafea Mihalovna&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo; said Levin,
        slapping himself on the head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d positively forgotten her
        even.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much better.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, anyway I&rsquo;ll run down to her. Before you&rsquo;ve time
        to get your hat on, I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he ran downstairs, clattering with his heels like a spring-rattle.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 7</h3>

      <p>
        Stephan Arkadyevitch had gone to Petersburg to perform the most natural
        and essential official duty&mdash;so familiar to everyone in the
        government service, though incomprehensible to outsiders&mdash;that
        duty, but for which one could hardly be in government service, of
        reminding the ministry of his existence&mdash;and having, for the due
        performance of this rite, taken all the available cash from home, was
        gaily and agreeably spending his days at the races and in the summer
        villas. Meanwhile Dolly and the children had moved into the country, to
        cut down expenses as much as possible. She had gone to Ergushovo, the
        estate that had been her dowry, and the one where in spring the forest
        had been sold. It was nearly forty miles from Levin&rsquo;s Pokrovskoe.
        The big, old house at Ergushovo had been pulled down long ago, and the
        old prince had had the lodge done up and built on to. Twenty years
        before, when Dolly was a child, the lodge had been roomy and
        comfortable, though, like all lodges, it stood sideways to the entrance
        avenue, and faced the south. But by now this lodge was old and
        dilapidated. When Stepan Arkadyevitch had gone down in the spring to
        sell the forest, Dolly had begged him to look over the house and order
        what repairs might be needed. Stepan Arkadyevitch, like all unfaithful
        husbands indeed, was very solicitous for his wife&rsquo;s comfort, and
        he had himself looked over the house, and given instructions about
        everything that he considered necessary. What he considered necessary
        was to cover all the furniture with cretonne, to put up curtains, to
        weed the garden, to make a little bridge on the pond, and to plant
        flowers. But he forgot many other essential matters, the want of which
        greatly distressed Darya Alexandrovna later on.
      </p>

        In spite of Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s efforts to be an attentive
        father and husband, he never could keep in his mind that he had a wife
        and children. He had bachelor tastes, and it was in accordance with them
        that he shaped his life. On his return to Moscow he informed his wife
        with pride that everything was ready, that the house would be a little
        paradise, and that he advised her most certainly to go. His wife&rsquo;s
        staying away in the country was very agreeable to Stepan Arkadyevitch
        from every point of view: it did the children good, it decreased
        expenses, and it left him more at liberty. Darya Alexandrovna regarded
        staying in the country for the summer as essential for the children,
        especially for the little girl, who had not succeeded in regaining her
        strength after the scarlatina, and also as a means of escaping the petty
        humiliations, the little bills owing to the wood-merchant, the
        fishmonger, the shoemaker, which made her miserable. Besides this, she
        was pleased to go away to the country because she was dreaming of
        getting her sister Kitty to stay with her there. Kitty was to be back
        from abroad in the middle of the summer, and bathing had been prescribed
        for her. Kitty wrote that no prospect was so alluring as to spend the
        summer with Dolly at Ergushovo, full of childish associations for both
        of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first days of her existence in the country were very hard for Dolly.
        She used to stay in the country as a child, and the impression she had
        retained of it was that the country was a refuge from all the
        unpleasantness of the town, that life there, though not
        luxurious&mdash;Dolly could easily make up her mind to that&mdash;was
        cheap and comfortable; that there was plenty of everything, everything
        was cheap, everything could be got, and children were happy. But now
        coming to the country as the head of a family, she perceived that it was
        all utterly unlike what she had fancied.
      </p>

      <p>
        The day after their arrival there was a heavy fall of rain, and in the
        night the water came through in the corridor and in the nursery, so that
        the beds had to be carried into the drawing-room. There was no kitchen
        maid to be found; of the nine cows, it appeared from the words of the
        cowherd-woman that some were about to calve, others had just calved,
        others were old, and others again hard-uddered; there was not butter nor
        milk enough even for the children. There were no eggs. They could get no
        fowls; old, purplish, stringy cocks were all they had for roasting and
        boiling. Impossible to get women to scrub the floors&mdash;all were
        potato-hoeing. Driving was out of the question, because one of the
        horses was restive, and bolted in the shafts. There was no place where
        they could bathe; the whole of the river-bank was trampled by the cattle
        and open to the road; even walks were impossible, for the cattle strayed
        into the garden through a gap in the hedge, and there was one terrible
        bull, who bellowed, and therefore might be expected to gore somebody.
        There were no proper cupboards for their clothes; what cupboards there
        were either would not close at all, or burst open whenever anyone passed
        by them. There were no pots and pans; there was no copper in the
        washhouse, nor even an ironing-board in the maids&rsquo; room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finding instead of peace and rest all these, from her point of view,
        fearful calamities, Darya Alexandrovna was at first in despair. She
        exerted herself to the utmost, felt the hopelessness of the position,
        and was every instant suppressing the tears that started into her eyes.
        The bailiff, a retired quartermaster, whom Stepan Arkadyevitch had taken
        a fancy to and had appointed bailiff on account of his handsome and
        respectful appearance as a hall-porter, showed no sympathy for Darya
        Alexandrovna&rsquo;s woes. He said respectfully, &ldquo;nothing can be
        done, the peasants are such a wretched lot,&rdquo; and did nothing to
        help her.
      </p>

      <p>
        The position seemed hopeless. But in the Oblonskys&rsquo; household, as
        in all families indeed, there was one inconspicuous but most valuable
        and useful person, Marya Philimonovna. She soothed her mistress, assured
        her that everything would <i>come round</i> (it was her expression, and
        Matvey had borrowed it from her), and without fuss or hurry proceeded to
        set to work herself. She had immediately made friends with the
        bailiff&rsquo;s wife, and on the very first day she drank tea with her
        and the bailiff under the acacias, and reviewed all the circumstances of
        the position. Very soon Marya Philimonovna had established her club, so
        to say, under the acacias, and there it was, in this club, consisting of
        the bailiff&rsquo;s wife, the village elder, and the counting-house
        clerk, that the difficulties of existence were gradually smoothed away,
        and in a week&rsquo;s time everything actually had come round. The roof
        was mended, a kitchen maid was found&mdash;a crony of the village
        elder&rsquo;s&mdash;hens were bought, the cows began giving milk, the
        garden hedge was stopped up with stakes, the carpenter made a mangle,
        hooks were put in the cupboards, and they ceased to burst open
        spontaneously, and an ironing-board covered with army cloth was placed
        across from the arm of a chair to the chest of drawers, and there was a
        smell of flatirons in the maids&rsquo; room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Just see, now, and you were quite in despair,&rdquo; said Marya
        Philimonovna, pointing to the ironing-board. They even rigged up a
        bathing-shed of straw hurdles. Lily began to bathe, and Darya
        Alexandrovna began to realize, if only in part, her expectations, if not
        of a peaceful, at least of a comfortable, life in the country. Peaceful
        with six children Darya Alexandrovna could not be. One would fall ill,
        another might easily become so, a third would be without something
        necessary, a fourth would show symptoms of a bad disposition, and so on.
        Rare indeed were the brief periods of peace. But these cares and
        anxieties were for Darya Alexandrovna the sole happiness possible. Had
        it not been for them, she would have been left alone to brood over her
        husband who did not love her. And besides, hard though it was for the
        mother to bear the dread of illness, the illnesses themselves, and the
        grief of seeing signs of evil propensities in her children&mdash;the
        children themselves were even now repaying her in small joys for her
        sufferings. Those joys were so small that they passed unnoticed, like
        gold in sand, and at bad moments she could see nothing but the pain,
        nothing but sand; but there were good moments too when she saw nothing
        but the joy, nothing but gold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now in the solitude of the country, she began to be more and more
        frequently aware of those joys. Often, looking at them, she would make
        every possible effort to persuade herself that she was mistaken, that
        she as a mother was partial to her children. All the same, she could not
        help saying to herself that she had charming children, all six of them
        in different ways, but a set of children such as is not often to be met
        with, and she was happy in them, and proud of them.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 8</h3>

      <p>
        Towards the end of May, when everything had been more or less
        satisfactorily arranged, she received her husband&rsquo;s answer to her
        complaints of the disorganized state of things in the country. He wrote
        begging her forgiveness for not having thought of everything before, and
        promised to come down at the first chance. This chance did not present
        itself, and till the beginning of June Darya Alexandrovna stayed alone
        in the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the Sunday in St. Peter&rsquo;s week Darya Alexandrovna drove to mass
        for all her children to take the sacrament. Darya Alexandrovna in her
        intimate, philosophical talks with her sister, her mother, and her
        friends very often astonished them by the freedom of her views in regard
        to religion. She had a strange religion of transmigration of souls all
        her own, in which she had firm faith, troubling herself little about the
        dogmas of the Church. But in her family she was strict in carrying out
        all that was required by the Church&mdash;and not merely in order to set
        an example, but with all her heart in it. The fact that the children had
        not been at the sacrament for nearly a year worried her extremely, and
        with the full approval and sympathy of Marya Philimonovna she decided
        that this should take place now in the summer.
      </p>

      <p>
        For several days before, Darya Alexandrovna was busily deliberating on
        how to dress all the children. Frocks were made or altered and washed,
        seams and flounces were let out, buttons were sewn on, and ribbons got
        ready. One dress, Tanya&rsquo;s, which the English governess had
        undertaken, cost Darya Alexandrovna much loss of temper. The English
        governess in altering it had made the seams in the wrong place, had
        taken up the sleeves too much, and altogether spoilt the dress. It was
        so narrow on Tanya&rsquo;s shoulders that it was quite painful to look
        at her. But Marya Philimonovna had the happy thought of putting in
        gussets, and adding a little shoulder-cape. The dress was set right, but
        there was nearly a quarrel with the English governess. On the morning,
        however, all was happily arranged, and towards ten
        o&rsquo;clock&mdash;the time at which they had asked the priest to wait
        for them for the mass&mdash;the children in their new dresses, with
        beaming faces, stood on the step before the carriage waiting for their
        mother.
      </p>

      <p>
        To the carriage, instead of the restive Raven, they had harnessed,
        thanks to the representations of Marya Philimonovna, the bailiff&rsquo;s
        horse, Brownie, and Darya Alexandrovna, delayed by anxiety over her own
        attire, came out and got in, dressed in a white muslin gown.
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna had done her hair, and dressed with care and
        excitement. In the old days she had dressed for her own sake to look
        pretty and be admired. Later on, as she got older, dress became more and
        more distasteful to her. She saw that she was losing her good looks. But
        now she began to feel pleasure and interest in dress again. Now she did
        not dress for her own sake, not for the sake of her own beauty, but
        simply that as the mother of those exquisite creatures she might not
        spoil the general effect. And looking at herself for the last time in
        the looking-glass she was satisfied with herself. She looked nice. Not
        nice as she would have wished to look nice in old days at a ball, but
        nice for the object which she now had in view.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the church there was no one but the peasants, the servants and their
        women-folk. But Darya Alexandrovna saw, or fancied she saw, the
        sensation produced by her children and her. The children were not only
        beautiful to look at in their smart little dresses, but they were
        charming in the way they behaved. Aliosha, it is true, did not stand
        quite correctly; he kept turning round, trying to look at his little
        jacket from behind; but all the same he was wonderfully sweet. Tanya
        behaved like a grown-up person, and looked after the little ones. And
        the smallest, Lily, was bewitching in her naïve astonishment at
        everything, and it was difficult not to smile when, after taking the
        sacrament, she said in English, &ldquo;Please, some more.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        On the way home the children felt that something solemn had happened,
        and were very sedate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything went happily at home too; but at lunch Grisha began
        whistling, and, what was worse, was disobedient to the English
        governess, and was forbidden to have any tart. Darya Alexandrovna would
        not have let things go so far on such a day had she been present; but
        she had to support the English governess&rsquo;s authority, and she
        upheld her decision that Grisha should have no tart. This rather spoiled
        the general good humor. Grisha cried, declaring that Nikolinka had
        whistled too, and he was not punished, and that he wasn&rsquo;t crying
        for the tart&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t care&mdash;but at being unjustly
        treated. This was really too tragic, and Darya Alexandrovna made up her
        mind to persuade the English governess to forgive Grisha, and she went
        to speak to her. But on the way, as she passed the drawing-room, she
        beheld a scene, filling her heart with such pleasure that the tears came
        into her eyes, and she forgave the delinquent herself.
      </p>

      <p>
        The culprit was sitting at the window in the corner of the drawing-room;
        beside him was standing Tanya with a plate. On the pretext of wanting to
        give some dinner to her dolls, she had asked the governess&rsquo;s
        permission to take her share of tart to the nursery, and had taken it
        instead to her brother. While still weeping over the injustice of his
        punishment, he was eating the tart, and kept saying through his sobs,
        &ldquo;Eat yourself; let&rsquo;s eat it together ... together.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Tanya had at first been under the influence of her pity for Grisha, then
        of a sense of her noble action, and tears were standing in her eyes too;
        but she did not refuse, and ate her share.
      </p>

      <p>
        On catching sight of their mother they were dismayed, but, looking into
        her face, they saw they were not doing wrong. They burst out laughing,
        and, with their mouths full of tart, they began wiping their smiling
        lips with their hands, and smearing their radiant faces all over with
        tears and jam.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mercy! Your new white frock! Tanya! Grisha!&rdquo; said their
        mother, trying to save the frock, but with tears in her eyes, smiling a
        blissful, rapturous smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        The new frocks were taken off, and orders were given for the little
        girls to have their blouses put on, and the boys their old jackets, and
        the wagonette to be harnessed; with Brownie, to the bailiff&rsquo;s
        annoyance, again in the shafts, to drive out for mushroom picking and
        bathing. A roar of delighted shrieks arose in the nursery, and never
        ceased till they had set off for the bathing-place.
      </p>

      <p>
        They gathered a whole basketful of mushrooms; even Lily found a birch
        mushroom. It had always happened before that Miss Hoole found them and
        pointed them out to her; but this time she found a big one quite of
        herself, and there was a general scream of delight, &ldquo;Lily has
        found a mushroom!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Then they reached the river, put the horses under the birch trees, and
        went to the bathing-place. The coachman, Terenty, fastened the horses,
        who kept whisking away the flies, to a tree, and, treading down the
        grass, lay down in the shade of a birch and smoked his shag, while the
        never-ceasing shrieks of delight of the children floated across to him
        from the bathing-place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though it was hard work to look after all the children and restrain
        their wild pranks, though it was difficult too to keep in one&rsquo;s
        head and not mix up all the stockings, little breeches, and shoes for
        the different legs, and to undo and to do up again all the tapes and
        buttons, Darya Alexandrovna, who had always liked bathing herself, and
        believed it to be very good for the children, enjoyed nothing so much as
        bathing with all the children. To go over all those fat little legs,
        pulling on their stockings, to take in her arms and dip those little
        naked bodies, and to hear their screams of delight and alarm, to see the
        breathless faces with wide-open, scared, and happy eyes of all her
        splashing cherubs, was a great pleasure to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        When half the children had been dressed, some peasant women in holiday
        dress, out picking herbs, came up to the bathing-shed and stopped shyly.
        Marya Philimonovna called one of them and handed her a sheet and a shirt
        that had dropped into the water for her to dry them, and Darya
        Alexandrovna began to talk to the women. At first they laughed behind
        their hands and did not understand her questions, but soon they grew
        bolder and began to talk, winning Darya Alexandrovna&rsquo;s heart at
        once by the genuine admiration of the children that they showed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My, what a beauty! as white as sugar,&rdquo; said one, admiring
        Tanitchka, and shaking her head; &ldquo;but thin....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, she has been ill.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And so they&rsquo;ve been bathing you too,&rdquo; said another to
        the baby.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; he&rsquo;s only three months old,&rdquo; answered Darya
        Alexandrovna with pride.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And have you any children?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had four; I&rsquo;ve two living&mdash;a boy and a
        girl. I weaned her last carnival.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How old is she?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, two years old.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why did you nurse her so long?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our custom; for three fasts....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And the conversation became most interesting to Darya Alexandrovna. What
        sort of time did she have? What was the matter with the boy? Where was
        her husband? Did it often happen?
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna felt disinclined to leave the peasant women, so
        interesting to her was their conversation, so completely identical were
        all their interests. What pleased her most of all was that she saw
        clearly what all the women admired more than anything was her having so
        many children, and such fine ones. The peasant women even made Darya
        Alexandrovna laugh, and offended the English governess, because she was
        the cause of the laughter she did not understand. One of the younger
        women kept staring at the Englishwoman, who was dressing after all the
        rest, and when she put on her third petticoat she could not refrain from
        the remark, &ldquo;My, she keeps putting on and putting on, and
        she&rsquo;ll never have done!&rdquo; she said, and they all went off
        into roars.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 9</h3>

      <p>
        On the drive home, as Darya Alexandrovna, with all her children round
        her, their heads still wet from their bath, and a kerchief tied over her
        own head, was getting near the house, the coachman said,
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some gentleman coming: the master of Pokrovskoe, I
        do believe.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna peeped out in front, and was delighted when she
        recognized in the gray hat and gray coat the familiar figure of Levin
        walking to meet them. She was glad to see him at any time, but at this
        moment she was specially glad he should see her in all her glory. No one
        was better able to appreciate her grandeur than Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seeing her, he found himself face to face with one of the pictures of
        his daydream of family life.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like a hen with your chickens, Darya
        Alexandrovna.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, how glad I am to see you!&rdquo; she said, holding out her
        hand to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Glad to see me, but you didn&rsquo;t let me know. My
        brother&rsquo;s staying with me. I got a note from Stiva that you were
        here.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;From Stiva?&rdquo; Darya Alexandrovna asked with surprise.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; he writes that you are here, and that he thinks you might
        allow me to be of use to you,&rdquo; said Levin, and as he said it he
        became suddenly embarrassed, and, stopping abruptly, he walked on in
        silence by the wagonette, snapping off the buds of the lime trees and
        nibbling them. He was embarrassed through a sense that Darya
        Alexandrovna would be annoyed by receiving from an outsider help that
        should by rights have come from her own husband. Darya Alexandrovna
        certainly did not like this little way of Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s of
        foisting his domestic duties on others. And she was at once aware that
        Levin was aware of this. It was just for this fineness of perception,
        for this delicacy, that Darya Alexandrovna liked Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know, of course,&rdquo; said Levin, &ldquo;that that simply
        means that you would like to see me, and I&rsquo;m exceedingly glad.
        Though I can fancy that, used to town housekeeping as you are, you must
        feel in the wilds here, and if there&rsquo;s anything wanted, I&rsquo;m
        altogether at your disposal.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Dolly. &ldquo;At first things were rather
        uncomfortable, but now we&rsquo;ve settled everything
        capitally&mdash;thanks to my old nurse,&rdquo; she said, indicating
        Marya Philimonovna, who, seeing that they were speaking of her, smiled
        brightly and cordially to Levin. She knew him, and knew that he would be
        a good match for her young lady, and was very keen to see the matter
        settled.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you get in, sir, we&rsquo;ll make room this
        side!&rdquo; she said to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll walk. Children, who&rsquo;d like to race the
        horses with me?&rdquo; The children knew Levin very little, and could
        not remember when they had seen him, but they experienced in regard to
        him none of that strange feeling of shyness and hostility which children
        so often experience towards hypocritical, grown-up people, and for which
        they are so often and miserably punished. Hypocrisy in anything whatever
        may deceive the cleverest and most penetrating man, but the least
        wide-awake of children recognizes it, and is revolted by it, however
        ingeniously it may be disguised. Whatever faults Levin had, there was
        not a trace of hypocrisy in him, and so the children showed him the same
        friendliness that they saw in their mother&rsquo;s face. On his
        invitation, the two elder ones at once jumped out to him and ran with
        him as simply as they would have done with their nurse or Miss Hoole or
        their mother. Lily, too, began begging to go to him, and her mother
        handed her to him; he sat her on his shoulder and ran along with her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, don&rsquo;t be afraid, Darya
        Alexandrovna!&rdquo; he said, smiling good-humoredly to the mother;
        &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no chance of my hurting or dropping her.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And, looking at his strong, agile, assiduously careful and needlessly
        wary movements, the mother felt her mind at rest, and smiled gaily and
        approvingly as she watched him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, in the country, with children, and with Darya Alexandrovna, with
        whom he was in sympathy, Levin was in a mood not infrequent with him, of
        childlike light-heartedness that she particularly liked in him. As he
        ran with the children, he taught them gymnastic feats, set Miss Hoole
        laughing with his queer English accent, and talked to Darya Alexandrovna
        of his pursuits in the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        After dinner, Darya Alexandrovna, sitting alone with him on the balcony,
        began to speak of Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You know, Kitty&rsquo;s coming here, and is going to spend the
        summer with me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he said, flushing, and at once, to change the
        conversation, he said: &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll send you two cows, shall
        I? If you insist on a bill you shall pay me five roubles a month; but
        it&rsquo;s really too bad of you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, thank you. We can manage very well now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, then, I&rsquo;ll have a look at your cows, and if
        you&rsquo;ll allow me, I&rsquo;ll give directions about their food.
        Everything depends on their food.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Levin, to turn the conversation, explained to Darya Alexandrovna the
        theory of cow-keeping, based on the principle that the cow is simply a
        machine for the transformation of food into milk, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        He talked of this, and passionately longed to hear more of Kitty, and,
        at the same time, was afraid of hearing it. He dreaded the breaking up
        of the inward peace he had gained with such effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there
        to look after it?&rdquo; Darya Alexandrovna responded, without interest.
      </p>

      <p>
        She had by now got her household matters so satisfactorily arranged,
        thanks to Marya Philimonovna, that she was disinclined to make any
        change in them; besides, she had no faith in Levin&rsquo;s knowledge of
        farming. General principles, as to the cow being a machine for the
        production of milk, she looked on with suspicion. It seemed to her that
        such principles could only be a hindrance in farm management. It all
        seemed to her a far simpler matter: all that was needed, as Marya
        Philimonovna had explained, was to give Brindle and Whitebreast more
        food and drink, and not to let the cook carry all the kitchen slops to
        the laundry maid&rsquo;s cow. That was clear. But general propositions
        as to feeding on meal and on grass were doubtful and obscure. And, what
        was most important, she wanted to talk about Kitty.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 10</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kitty writes to me that there&rsquo;s nothing she longs for so
        much as quiet and solitude,&rdquo; Dolly said after the silence that had
        followed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And how is she&mdash;better?&rdquo; Levin asked in agitation.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank God, she&rsquo;s quite well again. I never believed her
        lungs were affected.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m very glad!&rdquo; said Levin, and Dolly fancied she
        saw something touching, helpless, in his face as he said this and looked
        silently into her face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let me ask you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,&rdquo; said Darya
        Alexandrovna, smiling her kindly and rather mocking smile, &ldquo;why is
        it you are angry with Kitty?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I? I&rsquo;m not angry with her,&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you are angry. Why was it you did not come to see us nor
        them when you were in Moscow?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Darya Alexandrovna,&rdquo; he said, blushing up to the roots of
        his hair, &ldquo;I wonder really that with your kind heart you
        don&rsquo;t feel this. How it is you feel no pity for me, if nothing
        else, when you know....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do I know?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You know I made an offer and that I was refused,&rdquo; said
        Levin, and all the tenderness he had been feeling for Kitty a minute
        before was replaced by a feeling of anger for the slight he had
        suffered.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What makes you suppose I know?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Because everybody knows it....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just where you are mistaken; I did not know it,
        though I had guessed it was so.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, now you know it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All I knew was that something had happened that made her
        dreadfully miserable, and that she begged me never to speak of it. And
        if she would not tell me, she would certainly not speak of it to anyone
        else. But what did pass between you? Tell me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have told you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;When was it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;When I was at their house the last time.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know that,&rdquo; said Darya Alexandrovna, &ldquo;I am
        awfully, awfully sorry for her. You suffer only from pride....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said Levin, &ldquo;but....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She interrupted him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But she, poor girl ... I am awfully, awfully sorry for her. Now I
        see it all.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, Darya Alexandrovna, you must excuse me,&rdquo; he said,
        getting up. &ldquo;Good-bye, Darya Alexandrovna, till we meet
        again.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, wait a minute,&rdquo; she said, clutching him by the sleeve.
        &ldquo;Wait a minute, sit down.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Please, please, don&rsquo;t let us talk of this,&rdquo; he said,
        sitting down, and at the same time feeling rise up and stir within his
        heart a hope he had believed to be buried.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If I did not like you,&rdquo; she said, and tears came into her
        eyes; &ldquo;if I did not know you, as I do know you....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The feeling that had seemed dead revived more and more, rose up and took
        possession of Levin&rsquo;s heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I understand it all now,&rdquo; said Darya Alexandrovna.
        &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t understand it; for you men, who are free and make
        your own choice, it&rsquo;s always clear whom you love. But a
        girl&rsquo;s in a position of suspense, with all a woman&rsquo;s or
        maiden&rsquo;s modesty, a girl who sees you men from afar, who takes
        everything on trust,&mdash;a girl may have, and often has, such a
        feeling that she cannot tell what to say.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, if the heart does not speak....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, the heart does speak; but just consider: you men have views
        about a girl, you come to the house, you make friends, you criticize,
        you wait to see if you have found what you love, and then, when you are
        sure you love her, you make an offer....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not quite it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anyway you make an offer, when your love is ripe or when the
        balance has completely turned between the two you are choosing from. But
        a girl is not asked. She is expected to make her choice, and yet she
        cannot choose, she can only answer &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or
        &lsquo;no.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, to choose between me and Vronsky,&rdquo; thought Levin, and
        the dead thing that had come to life within him died again, and only
        weighed on his heart and set it aching.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Darya Alexandrovna,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s how one
        chooses a new dress or some purchase or other, not love. The choice has
        been made, and so much the better.... And there can be no repeating
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, pride, pride!&rdquo; said Darya Alexandrovna, as though
        despising him for the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that
        other feeling which only women know. &ldquo;At the time when you made
        Kitty an offer she was just in a position in which she could not answer.
        She was in doubt. Doubt between you and Vronsky. Him she was seeing
        every day, and you she had not seen for a long while. Supposing she had
        been older ... I, for instance, in her place could have felt no doubt. I
        always disliked him, and so it has turned out.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin recalled Kitty&rsquo;s answer. She had said: &ldquo;<i
          >No, that cannot be</i
        >....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Darya Alexandrovna,&rdquo; he said dryly, &ldquo;I appreciate
        your confidence in me; I believe you are making a mistake. But whether I
        am right or wrong, that pride you so despise makes any thought of
        Katerina Alexandrovna out of the question for me,&mdash;you understand,
        utterly out of the question.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I will only say one thing more: you know that I am speaking of my
        sister, whom I love as I love my own children. I don&rsquo;t say she
        cared for you, all I meant to say is that her refusal at that moment
        proves nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; said Levin, jumping up. &ldquo;If you
        only knew how you are hurting me. It&rsquo;s just as if a child of yours
        were dead, and they were to say to you: He would have been like this and
        like that, and he might have lived, and how happy you would have been in
        him. But he&rsquo;s dead, dead, dead!...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How absurd you are!&rdquo; said Darya Alexandrovna, looking with
        mournful tenderness at Levin&rsquo;s excitement. &ldquo;Yes, I see it
        all more and more clearly,&rdquo; she went on musingly. &ldquo;So you
        won&rsquo;t come to see us, then, when Kitty&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t come. Of course I won&rsquo;t avoid meeting
        Katerina Alexandrovna, but as far as I can, I will try to save her the
        annoyance of my presence.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are very, very absurd,&rdquo; repeated Darya Alexandrovna,
        looking with tenderness into his face. &ldquo;Very well then, let it be
        as though we had not spoken of this. What have you come for,
        Tanya?&rdquo; she said in French to the little girl who had come in.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my spade, mamma?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I speak French, and you must too.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The little girl tried to say it in French, but could not remember the
        French for spade; the mother prompted her, and then told her in French
        where to look for the spade. And this made a disagreeable impression on
        Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything in Darya Alexandrovna&rsquo;s house and children struck him
        now as by no means so charming as a little while before. &ldquo;And what
        does she talk French with the children for?&rdquo; he thought;
        &ldquo;how unnatural and false it is! And the children feel it so:
        Learning French and unlearning sincerity,&rdquo; he thought to himself,
        unaware that Darya Alexandrovna had thought all that over twenty times
        already, and yet, even at the cost of some loss of sincerity, believed
        it necessary to teach her children French in that way.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But why are you going? Do stay a little.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin stayed to tea; but his good-humor had vanished, and he felt ill at
        ease.
      </p>

      <p>
        After tea he went out into the hall to order his horses to be put in,
        and, when he came back, he found Darya Alexandrovna greatly disturbed,
        with a troubled face, and tears in her eyes. While Levin had been
        outside, an incident had occurred which had utterly shattered all the
        happiness she had been feeling that day, and her pride in her children.
        Grisha and Tanya had been fighting over a ball. Darya Alexandrovna,
        hearing a scream in the nursery, ran in and saw a terrible sight. Tanya
        was pulling Grisha&rsquo;s hair, while he, with a face hideous with
        rage, was beating her with his fists wherever he could get at her.
        Something snapped in Darya Alexandrovna&rsquo;s heart when she saw this.
        It was as if darkness had swooped down upon her life; she felt that
        these children of hers, that she was so proud of, were not merely most
        ordinary, but positively bad, ill-bred children, with coarse, brutal
        propensities&mdash;wicked children.
      </p>

      <p>
        She could not talk or think of anything else, and she could not speak to
        Levin of her misery.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin saw she was unhappy and tried to comfort her, saying that it
        showed nothing bad, that all children fight; but, even as he said it, he
        was thinking in his heart: &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t be artificial and
        talk French with my children; but my children won&rsquo;t be like that.
        All one has to do is not spoil children, not to distort their nature,
        and they&rsquo;ll be delightful. No, my children won&rsquo;t be like
        that.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He said good-bye and drove away, and she did not try to keep him.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 11</h3>

      <p>
        In the middle of July the elder of the village on Levin&rsquo;s
        sister&rsquo;s estate, about fifteen miles from Pokrovskoe, came to
        Levin to report on how things were going there and on the hay. The chief
        source of income on his sister&rsquo;s estate was from the riverside
        meadows. In former years the hay had been bought by the peasants for
        twenty roubles the three acres. When Levin took over the management of
        the estate, he thought on examining the grasslands that they were worth
        more, and he fixed the price at twenty-five roubles the three acres. The
        peasants would not give that price, and, as Levin suspected, kept off
        other purchasers. Then Levin had driven over himself, and arranged to
        have the grass cut, partly by hired labor, partly at a payment of a
        certain proportion of the crop. His own peasants put every hindrance
        they could in the way of this new arrangement, but it was carried out,
        and the first year the meadows had yielded a profit almost double. The
        previous year&mdash;which was the third year&mdash;the peasants had
        maintained the same opposition to the arrangement, and the hay had been
        cut on the same system. This year the peasants were doing all the mowing
        for a third of the hay crop, and the village elder had come now to
        announce that the hay had been cut, and that, fearing rain, they had
        invited the counting-house clerk over, had divided the crop in his
        presence, and had raked together eleven stacks as the owner&rsquo;s
        share. From the vague answers to his question how much hay had been cut
        on the principal meadow, from the hurry of the village elder who had
        made the division, not asking leave, from the whole tone of the peasant,
        Levin perceived that there was something wrong in the division of the
        hay, and made up his mind to drive over himself to look into the matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Arriving for dinner at the village, and leaving his horse at the cottage
        of an old friend of his, the husband of his brother&rsquo;s wet-nurse,
        Levin went to see the old man in his bee-house, wanting to find out from
        him the truth about the hay. Parmenitch, a talkative, comely old man,
        gave Levin a very warm welcome, showed him all he was doing, told him
        everything about his bees and the swarms of that year; but gave vague
        and unwilling answers to Levin&rsquo;s inquiries about the mowing. This
        confirmed Levin still more in his suspicions. He went to the hay fields
        and examined the stacks. The haystacks could not possibly contain fifty
        wagon-loads each, and to convict the peasants Levin ordered the wagons
        that had carried the hay to be brought up directly, to lift one stack,
        and carry it into the barn. There turned out to be only thirty-two loads
        in the stack. In spite of the village elder&rsquo;s assertions about the
        compressibility of hay, and its having settled down in the stacks, and
        his swearing that everything had been done in the fear of God, Levin
        stuck to his point that the hay had been divided without his orders, and
        that, therefore, he would not accept that hay as fifty loads to a stack.
        After a prolonged dispute the matter was decided by the peasants taking
        these eleven stacks, reckoning them as fifty loads each. The arguments
        and the division of the haycocks lasted the whole afternoon. When the
        last of the hay had been divided, Levin, intrusting the superintendence
        of the rest to the counting-house clerk, sat down on a haycock marked
        off by a stake of willow, and looked admiringly at the meadow swarming
        with peasants.
      </p>

      <p>
        In front of him, in the bend of the river beyond the marsh, moved a
        bright-colored line of peasant women, and the scattered hay was being
        rapidly formed into gray winding rows over the pale green stubble. After
        the women came the men with pitchforks, and from the gray rows there
        were growing up broad, high, soft haycocks. To the left, carts were
        rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared, and one after
        another the haycocks vanished, flung up in huge forkfuls, and in their
        place there were rising heavy cartloads of fragrant hay hanging over the
        horses&rsquo; hind-quarters.
      </p>

        &ldquo;What weather for haying! What hay it&rsquo;ll be!&rdquo; said an
        old man, squatting down beside Levin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tea, not hay!
        It&rsquo;s like scattering grain to the ducks, the way they pick it
        up!&rdquo; he added, pointing to the growing haycocks. &ldquo;Since
        dinner time they&rsquo;ve carried a good half of it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The last load, eh?&rdquo; he shouted to a young peasant, who
        drove by, standing in the front of an empty cart, shaking the cord
        reins.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The last, dad!&rdquo; the lad shouted back, pulling in the horse,
        and, smiling, he looked round at a bright, rosy-checked peasant girl who
        sat in the cart smiling too, and drove on.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that? Your son?&rdquo; asked Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My baby,&rdquo; said the old man with a tender smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a fine fellow!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The lad&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Married already?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s two years last St. Philip&rsquo;s day.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Any children?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Children indeed! Why, for over a year he was innocent as a babe
        himself, and bashful too,&rdquo; answered the old man. &ldquo;Well, the
        hay! It&rsquo;s as fragrant as tea!&rdquo; he repeated, wishing to
        change the subject.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin looked more attentively at Ivan Parmenov and his wife. They were
        loading a haycock onto the cart not far from him. Ivan Parmenov was
        standing on the cart, taking, laying in place, and stamping down the
        huge bundles of hay, which his pretty young wife deftly handed up to
        him, at first in armfuls, and then on the pitchfork. The young wife
        worked easily, merrily, and dexterously. The close-packed hay did not
        once break away off her fork. First she gathered it together, stuck the
        fork into it, then with a rapid, supple movement leaned the whole weight
        of her body on it, and at once with a bend of her back under the red
        belt she drew herself up, and arching her full bosom under the white
        smock, with a smart turn swung the fork in her arms, and flung the
        bundle of hay high onto the cart. Ivan, obviously doing his best to save
        her every minute of unnecessary labor, made haste, opening his arms to
        clutch the bundle and lay it in the cart. As she raked together what was
        left of the hay, the young wife shook off the bits of hay that had
        fallen on her neck, and straightening the red kerchief that had dropped
        forward over her white brow, not browned like her face by the sun, she
        crept under the cart to tie up the load. Ivan directed her how to fasten
        the cord to the cross-piece, and at something she said he laughed aloud.
        In the expressions of both faces was to be seen vigorous, young, freshly
        awakened love.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 12</h3>

      <p>
        The load was tied on. Ivan jumped down and took the quiet, sleek horse
        by the bridle. The young wife flung the rake up on the load, and with a
        bold step, swinging her arms, she went to join the women, who were
        forming a ring for the haymakers&rsquo; dance. Ivan drove off to the
        road and fell into line with the other loaded carts. The peasant women,
        with their rakes on their shoulders, gay with bright flowers, and
        chattering with ringing, merry voices, walked behind the hay cart. One
        wild untrained female voice broke into a song, and sang it alone through
        a verse, and then the same verse was taken up and repeated by half a
        hundred strong healthy voices, of all sorts, coarse and fine, singing in
        unison.
      </p>

      <p>
        The women, all singing, began to come close to Levin, and he felt as
        though a storm were swooping down upon him with a thunder of merriment.
        The storm swooped down, enveloped him and the haycock on which he was
        lying, and the other haycocks, and the wagon-loads, and the whole meadow
        and distant fields all seemed to be shaking and singing to the measures
        of this wild merry song with its shouts and whistles and clapping. Levin
        felt envious of this health and mirthfulness; he longed to take part in
        the expression of this joy of life. But he could do nothing, and had to
        lie and look on and listen. When the peasants, with their singing, had
        vanished out of sight and hearing, a weary feeling of despondency at his
        own isolation, his physical inactivity, his alienation from this world,
        came over Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the very peasants who had been most active in wrangling with him
        over the hay, some whom he had treated with contumely, and who had tried
        to cheat him, those very peasants had greeted him good-humoredly, and
        evidently had not, were incapable of having any feeling of rancor
        against him, any regret, any recollection even of having tried to
        deceive him. All that was drowned in a sea of merry common labor. God
        gave the day, God gave the strength. And the day and the strength were
        consecrated to labor, and that labor was its own reward. For whom the
        labor? What would be its fruits? These were idle
        considerations&mdash;beside the point.
      </p>

      <p>
        Often Levin had admired this life, often he had a sense of envy of the
        men who led this life; but today for the first time, especially under
        the influence of what he had seen in the attitude of Ivan Parmenov to
        his young wife, the idea presented itself definitely to his mind that it
        was in his power to exchange the dreary, artificial, idle, and
        individualistic life he was leading for this laborious, pure, and
        socially delightful life.
      </p>

      <p>
        The old man who had been sitting beside him had long ago gone home; the
        people had all separated. Those who lived near had gone home, while
        those who came from far were gathered into a group for supper, and to
        spend the night in the meadow. Levin, unobserved by the peasants, still
        lay on the haycock, and still looked on and listened and mused. The
        peasants who remained for the night in the meadow scarcely slept all the
        short summer night. At first there was the sound of merry talk and
        laughing all together over the supper, then singing again and laughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the long day of toil had left no trace in them but lightness of
        heart. Before the early dawn all was hushed. Nothing was to be heard but
        the night sounds of the frogs that never ceased in the marsh, and the
        horses snorting in the mist that rose over the meadow before the
        morning. Rousing himself, Levin got up from the haycock, and looking at
        the stars, he saw that the night was over.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what am I going to do? How am I to set about it?&rdquo; he
        said to himself, trying to express to himself all the thoughts and
        feelings he had passed through in that brief night. All the thoughts and
        feelings he had passed through fell into three separate trains of
        thought. One was the renunciation of his old life, of his utterly
        useless education. This renunciation gave him satisfaction, and was easy
        and simple. Another series of thoughts and mental images related to the
        life he longed to live now. The simplicity, the purity, the sanity of
        this life he felt clearly, and he was convinced he would find in it the
        content, the peace, and the dignity, of the lack of which he was so
        miserably conscious. But a third series of ideas turned upon the
        question how to effect this transition from the old life to the new. And
        there nothing took clear shape for him. &ldquo;Have a wife? Have work
        and the necessity of work? Leave Pokrovskoe? Buy land? Become a member
        of a peasant community? Marry a peasant girl? How am I to set about
        it?&rdquo; he asked himself again, and could not find an answer.
        &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t slept all night, though, and I can&rsquo;t think
        it out clearly,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll work it out
        later. One thing&rsquo;s certain, this night has decided my fate. All my
        old dreams of home life were absurd, not the real thing,&rdquo; he told
        himself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all ever so much simpler and
        better....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How beautiful!&rdquo; he thought, looking at the strange, as it
        were, mother-of-pearl shell of white fleecy cloudlets resting right over
        his head in the middle of the sky. &ldquo;How exquisite it all is in
        this exquisite night! And when was there time for that cloud-shell to
        form? Just now I looked at the sky, and there was nothing in
        it&mdash;only two white streaks. Yes, and so imperceptibly too my views
        of life changed!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He went out of the meadow and walked along the highroad towards the
        village. A slight wind arose, and the sky looked gray and sullen. The
        gloomy moment had come that usually precedes the dawn, the full triumph
        of light over darkness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shrinking from the cold, Levin walked rapidly, looking at the ground.
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? Someone coming,&rdquo; he thought, catching
        the tinkle of bells, and lifting his head. Forty paces from him a
        carriage with four horses harnessed abreast was driving towards him
        along the grassy road on which he was walking. The shaft-horses were
        tilted against the shafts by the ruts, but the dexterous driver sitting
        on the box held the shaft over the ruts, so that the wheels ran on the
        smooth part of the road.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was all Levin noticed, and without wondering who it could be, he
        gazed absently at the coach.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the coach was an old lady dozing in one corner, and at the window,
        evidently only just awake, sat a young girl holding in both hands the
        ribbons of a white cap. With a face full of light and thought, full of a
        subtle, complex inner life, that was remote from Levin, she was gazing
        beyond him at the glow of the sunrise.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the very instant when this apparition was vanishing, the truthful
        eyes glanced at him. She recognized him, and her face lighted up with
        wondering delight.
      </p>

      <p>
        He could not be mistaken. There were no other eyes like those in the
        world. There was only one creature in the world that could concentrate
        for him all the brightness and meaning of life. It was she. It was
        Kitty. He understood that she was driving to Ergushovo from the railway
        station. And everything that had been stirring Levin during that
        sleepless night, all the resolutions he had made, all vanished at once.
        He recalled with horror his dreams of marrying a peasant girl. There
        only, in the carriage that had crossed over to the other side of the
        road, and was rapidly disappearing, there only could he find the
        solution of the riddle of his life, which had weighed so agonizingly
        upon him of late.
      </p>

      <p>
        She did not look out again. The sound of the carriage-springs was no
        longer audible, the bells could scarcely be heard. The barking of dogs
        showed the carriage had reached the village, and all that was left was
        the empty fields all round, the village in front, and he himself
        isolated and apart from it all, wandering lonely along the deserted
        highroad.
      </p>

      <p>
        He glanced at the sky, expecting to find there the cloud shell he had
        been admiring and taking as the symbol of the ideas and feelings of that
        night. There was nothing in the sky in the least like a shell. There, in
        the remote heights above, a mysterious change had been accomplished.
        There was no trace of shell, and there was stretched over fully half the
        sky an even cover of tiny and ever tinier cloudlets. The sky had grown
        blue and bright; and with the same softness, but with the same
        remoteness, it met his questioning gaze.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;however good that life of
        simplicity and toil may be, I cannot go back to it. I love
        <i>her</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 13</h3>

      <p>
        None but those who were most intimate with Alexey Alexandrovitch knew
        that, while on the surface the coldest and most reasonable of men, he
        had one weakness quite opposed to the general trend of his character.
        Alexey Alexandrovitch could not hear or see a child or woman crying
        without being moved. The sight of tears threw him into a state of
        nervous agitation, and he utterly lost all power of reflection. The
        chief secretary of his department and his private secretary were aware
        of this, and used to warn women who came with petitions on no account to
        give way to tears, if they did not want to ruin their chances. &ldquo;He
        will get angry, and will not listen to you,&rdquo; they used to say. And
        as a fact, in such cases the emotional disturbance set up in Alexey
        Alexandrovitch by the sight of tears found expression in hasty anger.
        &ldquo;I can do nothing. Kindly leave the room!&rdquo; he would commonly
        cry in such cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        When returning from the races Anna had informed him of her relations
        with Vronsky, and immediately afterwards had burst into tears, hiding
        her face in her hands, Alexey Alexandrovitch, for all the fury aroused
        in him against her, was aware at the same time of a rush of that
        emotional disturbance always produced in him by tears. Conscious of it,
        and conscious that any expression of his feelings at that minute would
        be out of keeping with the position, he tried to suppress every
        manifestation of life in himself, and so neither stirred nor looked at
        her. This was what had caused that strange expression of deathlike
        rigidity in his face which had so impressed Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they reached the house he helped her to get out of the carriage,
        and making an effort to master himself, took leave of her with his usual
        urbanity, and uttered that phrase that bound him to nothing; he said
        that tomorrow he would let her know his decision.
      </p>

      <p>
        His wife&rsquo;s words, confirming his worst suspicions, had sent a
        cruel pang to the heart of Alexey Alexandrovitch. That pang was
        intensified by the strange feeling of physical pity for her set up by
        her tears. But when he was all alone in the carriage Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, to his surprise and delight, felt complete relief both
        from this pity and from the doubts and agonies of jealousy.
      </p>

      <p>
        He experienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out after
        suffering long from toothache. After a fearful agony and a sense of
        something huge, bigger than the head itself, being torn out of his jaw,
        the sufferer, hardly able to believe in his own good luck, feels all at
        once that what has so long poisoned his existence and enchained his
        attention, exists no longer, and that he can live and think again, and
        take interest in other things besides his tooth. This feeling Alexey
        Alexandrovitch was experiencing. The agony had been strange and
        terrible, but now it was over; he felt that he could live again and
        think of something other than his wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No honor, no heart, no religion; a corrupt woman. I always knew
        it and always saw it, though I tried to deceive myself to spare
        her,&rdquo; he said to himself. And it actually seemed to him that he
        always had seen it: he recalled incidents of their past life, in which
        he had never seen anything wrong before&mdash;now these incidents proved
        clearly that she had always been a corrupt woman. &ldquo;I made a
        mistake in linking my life to hers; but there was nothing wrong in my
        mistake, and so I cannot be unhappy. It&rsquo;s not I that am to
        blame,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;but she. But I have nothing to do
        with her. She does not exist for me....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything relating to her and her son, towards whom his sentiments were
        as much changed as towards her, ceased to interest him. The only thing
        that interested him now was the question of in what way he could best,
        with most propriety and comfort for himself, and thus with most justice,
        extricate himself from the mud with which she had spattered him in her
        fall, and then proceed along his path of active, honorable, and useful
        existence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot be made unhappy by the fact that a contemptible woman
        has committed a crime. I have only to find the best way out of the
        difficult position in which she has placed me. And I shall find
        it,&rdquo; he said to himself, frowning more and more. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
        not the first nor the last.&rdquo; And to say nothing of historical
        instances dating from the &ldquo;Fair Helen&rdquo; of Menelaus, recently
        revived in the memory of all, a whole list of contemporary examples of
        husbands with unfaithful wives in the highest society rose before Alexey
        Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s imagination. &ldquo;Daryalov, Poltavsky, Prince
        Karibanov, Count Paskudin, Dram.... Yes, even Dram, such an honest,
        capable fellow ... Semyonov, Tchagin, Sigonin,&rdquo; Alexey
        Alexandrovitch remembered. &ldquo;Admitting that a certain quite
        irrational <i>ridicule</i> falls to the lot of these men, yet I never
        saw anything but a misfortune in it, and always felt sympathy for
        it,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself, though indeed this was
        not the fact, and he had never felt sympathy for misfortunes of that
        kind, but the more frequently he had heard of instances of unfaithful
        wives betraying their husbands, the more highly he had thought of
        himself. &ldquo;It is a misfortune which may befall anyone. And this
        misfortune has befallen me. The only thing to be done is to make the
        best of the position.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he began passing in review the methods of proceeding of men who had
        been in the same position that he was in.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Daryalov fought a duel....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The duel had particularly fascinated the thoughts of Alexey
        Alexandrovitch in his youth, just because he was physically a coward,
        and was himself well aware of the fact. Alexey Alexandrovitch could not
        without horror contemplate the idea of a pistol aimed at himself, and
        had never made use of any weapon in his life. This horror had in his
        youth set him pondering on dueling, and picturing himself in a position
        in which he would have to expose his life to danger. Having attained
        success and an established position in the world, he had long ago
        forgotten this feeling; but the habitual bent of feeling reasserted
        itself, and dread of his own cowardice proved even now so strong that
        Alexey Alexandrovitch spent a long while thinking over the question of
        dueling in all its aspects, and hugging the idea of a duel, though he
        was fully aware beforehand that he would never under any circumstances
        fight one.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt our society is still so barbarous
        (it&rsquo;s not the same in England) that very many&rdquo;&mdash;and
        among these were those whose opinion Alexey Alexandrovitch particularly
        valued&mdash;&ldquo;look favorably on the duel; but what result is
        attained by it? Suppose I call him out,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch
        went on to himself, and vividly picturing the night he would spend after
        the challenge, and the pistol aimed at him, he shuddered, and knew that
        he never would do it&mdash;&ldquo;suppose I call him out. Suppose I am
        taught,&rdquo; he went on musing, &ldquo;to shoot; I press the
        trigger,&rdquo; he said to himself, closing his eyes, &ldquo;and it
        turns out I have killed him,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch said to
        himself, and he shook his head as though to dispel such silly ideas.
        &ldquo;What sense is there in murdering a man in order to define
        one&rsquo;s relation to a guilty wife and son? I should still just as
        much have to decide what I ought to do with her. But what is more
        probable and what would doubtless occur&mdash;I should be killed or
        wounded. I, the innocent person, should be the victim&mdash;killed or
        wounded. It&rsquo;s even more senseless. But apart from that, a
        challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my side. Don&rsquo;t
        I know perfectly well that my friends would never allow me to fight a
        duel&mdash;would never allow the life of a statesman, needed by Russia,
        to be exposed to danger? Knowing perfectly well beforehand that the
        matter would never come to real danger, it would amount to my simply
        trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge. That would
        be dishonest, that would be false, that would be deceiving myself and
        others. A duel is quite irrational, and no one expects it of me. My aim
        is simply to safeguard my reputation, which is essential for the
        uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties.&rdquo; Official duties, which
        had always been of great consequence in Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s
        eyes, seemed of special importance to his mind at this moment.
        Considering and rejecting the duel, Alexey Alexandrovitch turned to
        divorce&mdash;another solution selected by several of the husbands he
        remembered. Passing in mental review all the instances he knew of
        divorces (there were plenty of them in the very highest society with
        which he was very familiar), Alexey Alexandrovitch could not find a
        single example in which the object of divorce was that which he had in
        view. In all these instances the husband had practically ceded or sold
        his unfaithful wife, and the very party which, being in fault, had not
        the right to contract a fresh marriage, had formed counterfeit,
        pseudo-matrimonial ties with a self-styled husband. In his own case,
        Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that a legal divorce, that is to say, one in
        which only the guilty wife would be repudiated, was impossible of
        attainment. He saw that the complex conditions of the life they led made
        the coarse proofs of his wife&rsquo;s guilt, required by the law, out of
        the question; he saw that a certain refinement in that life would not
        admit of such proofs being brought forward, even if he had them, and
        that to bring forward such proofs would damage him in the public
        estimation more than it would her.
      </p>

      <p>
        An attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal, which
        would be a perfect godsend to his enemies for calumny and attacks on his
        high position in society. His chief object, to define the position with
        the least amount of disturbance possible, would not be attained by
        divorce either. Moreover, in the event of divorce, or even of an attempt
        to obtain a divorce, it was obvious that the wife broke off all
        relations with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover. And in
        spite of the complete, as he supposed, contempt and indifference he now
        felt for his wife, at the bottom of his heart Alexey Alexandrovitch
        still had one feeling left in regard to her&mdash;a disinclination to
        see her free to throw in her lot with Vronsky, so that her crime would
        be to her advantage. The mere notion of this so exasperated Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, that directly it rose to his mind he groaned with inward
        agony, and got up and changed his place in the carriage, and for a long
        while after, he sat with scowling brows, wrapping his numbed and bony
        legs in the fleecy rug.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Apart from formal divorce, One might still do like Karibanov,
        Paskudin, and that good fellow Dram&mdash;that is, separate from
        one&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; he went on thinking, when he had regained his
        composure. But this step too presented the same drawback of public
        scandal as a divorce, and what was more, a separation, quite as much as
        a regular divorce, flung his wife into the arms of Vronsky. &ldquo;No,
        it&rsquo;s out of the question, out of the question!&rdquo; he said
        again, twisting his rug about him again. &ldquo;I cannot be unhappy, but
        neither she nor he ought to be happy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The feeling of jealousy, which had tortured him during the period of
        uncertainty, had passed away at the instant when the tooth had been with
        agony extracted by his wife&rsquo;s words. But that feeling had been
        replaced by another, the desire, not merely that she should not be
        triumphant, but that she should get due punishment for her crime. He did
        not acknowledge this feeling, but at the bottom of his heart he longed
        for her to suffer for having destroyed his peace of mind&mdash;his
        honor. And going once again over the conditions inseparable from a duel,
        a divorce, a separation, and once again rejecting them, Alexey
        Alexandrovitch felt convinced that there was only one solution,&mdash;to
        keep her with him, concealing what had happened from the world, and
        using every measure in his power to break off the intrigue, and still
        more&mdash;though this he did not admit to himself&mdash;to punish her.
        &ldquo;I must inform her of my conclusion, that thinking over the
        terrible position in which she has placed her family, all other
        solutions will be worse for both sides than an external
        <i>status quo</i>, and that such I agree to retain, on the strict
        condition of obedience on her part to my wishes, that is to say,
        cessation of all intercourse with her lover.&rdquo; When this decision
        had been finally adopted, another weighty consideration occurred to
        Alexey Alexandrovitch in support of it. &ldquo;By such a course only
        shall I be acting in accordance with the dictates of religion,&rdquo; he
        told himself. &ldquo;In adopting this course, I am not casting off a
        guilty wife, but giving her a chance of amendment; and, indeed,
        difficult as the task will be to me, I shall devote part of my energies
        to her reformation and salvation.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Though Alexey Alexandrovitch was perfectly aware that he could not exert
        any moral influence over his wife, that such an attempt at reformation
        could lead to nothing but falsity; though in passing through these
        difficult moments he had not once thought of seeking guidance in
        religion, yet now, when his conclusion corresponded, as it seemed to
        him, with the requirements of religion, this religious sanction to his
        decision gave him complete satisfaction, and to some extent restored his
        peace of mind. He was pleased to think that, even in such an important
        crisis in life, no one would be able to say that he had not acted in
        accordance with the principles of that religion whose banner he had
        always held aloft amid the general coolness and indifference. As he
        pondered over subsequent developments, Alexey Alexandrovitch did not
        see, indeed, why his relations with his wife should not remain
        practically the same as before. No doubt, she could never regain his
        esteem, but there was not, and there could not be, any sort of reason
        that his existence should be troubled, and that he should suffer because
        she was a bad and faithless wife. &ldquo;Yes, time will pass; time,
        which arranges all things, and the old relations will be
        reestablished,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself; &ldquo;so far
        reestablished, that is, that I shall not be sensible of a break in the
        continuity of my life. She is bound to be unhappy, but I am not to
        blame, and so I cannot be unhappy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 14</h3>

      <p>
        As he neared Petersburg, Alexey Alexandrovitch not only adhered entirely
        to his decision, but was even composing in his head the letter he would
        write to his wife. Going into the porter&rsquo;s room, Alexey
        Alexandrovitch glanced at the letters and papers brought from his
        office, and directed that they should be brought to him in his study.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The horses can be taken out and I will see no one,&rdquo; he said
        in answer to the porter, with a certain pleasure, indicative of his
        agreeable frame of mind, emphasizing the words, &ldquo;see no
        one.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        In his study Alexey Alexandrovitch walked up and down twice, and stopped
        at an immense writing-table, on which six candles had already been
        lighted by the valet who had preceded him. He cracked his knuckles and
        sat down, sorting out his writing appurtenances. Putting his elbows on
        the table, he bent his head on one side, thought a minute, and began to
        write, without pausing for a second. He wrote without using any form of
        address to her, and wrote in French, making use of the plural
        &ldquo;<i>vous</i>,&rdquo; which has not the same note of coldness as
        the corresponding Russian form.

      <blockquote>
        <div>
          <p>
            &ldquo;At our last conversation, I notified you of my intention to
            communicate to you my decision in regard to the subject of that
            conversation. Having carefully considered everything, I am writing
            now with the object of fulfilling that promise. My decision is as
            follows. Whatever your conduct may have been, I do not consider
            myself justified in breaking the ties in which we are bound by a
            Higher Power. The family cannot be broken up by a whim, a caprice,
            or even by the sin of one of the partners in the marriage, and our
            life must go on as it has done in the past. This is essential for
            me, for you, and for our son. I am fully persuaded that you have
            repented and do repent of what has called forth the present letter,
            and that you will cooperate with me in eradicating the cause of our
            estrangement, and forgetting the past. In the contrary event, you
            can conjecture what awaits you and your son. All this I hope to
            discuss more in detail in a personal interview. As the season is
            drawing to a close, I would beg you to return to Petersburg as
            quickly as possible, not later than Tuesday. All necessary
            preparations shall be made for your arrival here. I beg you to note
            that I attach particular significance to compliance with this
            request.

          <p>
            &ldquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I enclose the money which may be needed for
            your expenses.&rdquo;
          </p>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        He read the letter through and felt pleased with it, and especially that
        he had remembered to enclose money: there was not a harsh word, not a
        reproach in it, nor was there undue indulgence. Most of all, it was a
        golden bridge for return. Folding the letter and smoothing it with a
        massive ivory knife, and putting it in an envelope with the money, he
        rang the bell with the gratification it always afforded him to use the
        well arranged appointments of his writing-table.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Give this to the courier to be delivered to Anna Arkadyevna
        tomorrow at the summer villa,&rdquo; he said, getting up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly, your excellency; tea to be served in the study?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch ordered tea to be brought to the study, and
        playing with the massive paper-knife, he moved to his easy chair, near
        which there had been placed ready for him a lamp and the French work on
        Egyptian hieroglyphics that he had begun. Over the easy chair there hung
        in a gold frame an oval portrait of Anna, a fine painting by a
        celebrated artist. Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at it. The unfathomable
        eyes gazed ironically and insolently at him. Insufferably insolent and
        challenging was the effect in Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s eyes of the
        black lace about the head, admirably touched in by the painter, the
        black hair and handsome white hand with one finger lifted, covered with
        rings. After looking at the portrait for a minute, Alexey Alexandrovitch
        shuddered so that his lips quivered and he uttered the sound
        &ldquo;brrr,&rdquo; and turned away. He made haste to sit down in his
        easy chair and opened the book. He tried to read, but he could not
        revive the very vivid interest he had felt before in Egyptian
        hieroglyphics. He looked at the book and thought of something else. He
        thought not of his wife, but of a complication that had arisen in his
        official life, which at the time constituted the chief interest of it.
        He felt that he had penetrated more deeply than ever before into this
        intricate affair, and that he had originated a leading idea&mdash;he
        could say it without self-flattery&mdash;calculated to clear up the
        whole business, to strengthen him in his official career, to discomfit
        his enemies, and thereby to be of the greatest benefit to the
        government. Directly the servant had set the tea and left the room,
        Alexey Alexandrovitch got up and went to the writing-table. Moving into
        the middle of the table a portfolio of papers, with a scarcely
        perceptible smile of self-satisfaction, he took a pencil from a rack and
        plunged into the perusal of a complex report relating to the present
        complication. The complication was of this nature: Alexey
        Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s characteristic quality as a politician, that
        special individual qualification that every rising functionary
        possesses, the qualification that with his unflagging ambition, his
        reserve, his honesty, and with his self-confidence had made his career,
        was his contempt for red tape, his cutting down of correspondence, his
        direct contact, wherever possible, with the living fact, and his
        economy. It happened that the famous Commission of the 2nd of June had
        set on foot an inquiry into the irrigation of lands in the Zaraisky
        province, which fell under Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s department, and
        was a glaring example of fruitless expenditure and paper reforms. Alexey
        Alexandrovitch was aware of the truth of this. The irrigation of these
        lands in the Zaraisky province had been initiated by the predecessor of
        Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s predecessor. And vast sums of money had
        actually been spent and were still being spent on this business, and
        utterly unproductively, and the whole business could obviously lead to
        nothing whatever. Alexey Alexandrovitch had perceived this at once on
        entering office, and would have liked to lay hands on the Board of
        Irrigation. But at first, when he did not yet feel secure in his
        position, he knew it would affect too many interests, and would be
        injudicious. Later on he had been engrossed in other questions, and had
        simply forgotten the Board of Irrigation. It went of itself, like all
        such boards, by the mere force of inertia. (Many people gained their
        livelihood by the Board of Irrigation, especially one highly
        conscientious and musical family: all the daughters played on stringed
        instruments, and Alexey Alexandrovitch knew the family and had stood
        godfather to one of the elder daughters.) The raising of this question
        by a hostile department was in Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s opinion a
        dishonorable proceeding, seeing that in every department there were
        things similar and worse, which no one inquired into, for well-known
        reasons of official etiquette. However, now that the glove had been
        thrown down to him, he had boldly picked it up and demanded the
        appointment of a special commission to investigate and verify the
        working of the Board of Irrigation of the lands in the Zaraisky
        province. But in compensation he gave no quarter to the enemy either. He
        demanded the appointment of another special commission to inquire into
        the question of the Native Tribes Organization Committee. The question
        of the Native Tribes had been brought up incidentally in the Commission
        of the 2nd of June, and had been pressed forward actively by Alexey
        Alexandrovitch as one admitting of no delay on account of the deplorable
        condition of the native tribes. In the commission this question had been
        a ground of contention between several departments. The department
        hostile to Alexey Alexandrovitch proved that the condition of the native
        tribes was exceedingly flourishing, that the proposed reconstruction
        might be the ruin of their prosperity, and that if there were anything
        wrong, it arose mainly from the failure on the part of Alexey
        Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s department to carry out the measures prescribed
        by law. Now Alexey Alexandrovitch intended to demand: First, that a new
        commission should be formed which should be empowered to investigate the
        condition of the native tribes on the spot; secondly, if it should
        appear that the condition of the native tribes actually was such as it
        appeared to be from the official documents in the hands of the
        committee, that another new scientific commission should be appointed to
        investigate the deplorable condition of the native tribes from
        the&mdash;(1) political, (2) administrative, (3) economic, (4)
        ethnographical, (5) material, and (6) religious points of view; thirdly,
        that evidence should be required from the rival department of the
        measures that had been taken during the last ten years by that
        department for averting the disastrous conditions in which the native
        tribes were now placed; and fourthly and finally, that that department
        explain why it had, as appeared from the evidence before the committee,
        from No. 17,015 and 18,038, from December 5, 1863, and June 7, 1864,
        acted in direct contravention of the intent of the law T... Act 18, and
        the note to Act 36. A flash of eagerness suffused the face of Alexey
        Alexandrovitch as he rapidly wrote out a synopsis of these ideas for his
        own benefit. Having filled a sheet of paper, he got up, rang, and sent a
        note to the chief secretary of his department to look up certain
        necessary facts for him. Getting up and walking about the room, he
        glanced again at the portrait, frowned, and smiled contemptuously. After
        reading a little more of the book on Egyptian hieroglyphics, and
        renewing his interest in it, Alexey Alexandrovitch went to bed at eleven
        o&rsquo;clock, and recollecting as he lay in bed the incident with his
        wife, he saw it now in by no means such a gloomy light.

      <h3>Chapter 15</h3>

      <p>
        Though Anna had obstinately and with exasperation contradicted Vronsky
        when he told her their position was impossible, at the bottom of her
        heart she regarded her own position as false and dishonorable, and she
        longed with her whole soul to change it. On the way home from the races
        she had told her husband the truth in a moment of excitement, and in
        spite of the agony she had suffered in doing so, she was glad of it.
        After her husband had left her, she told herself that she was glad, that
        now everything was made clear, and at least there would be no more lying
        and deception. It seemed to her beyond doubt that her position was now
        made clear forever. It might be bad, this new position, but it would be
        clear; there would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it. The pain
        she had caused herself and her husband in uttering those words would be
        rewarded now by everything being made clear, she thought. That evening
        she saw Vronsky, but she did not tell him of what had passed between her
        and her husband, though, to make the position definite, it was necessary
        to tell him.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she woke up next morning the first thing that rose to her mind was
        what she had said to her husband, and those words seemed to her so awful
        that she could not conceive now how she could have brought herself to
        utter those strange, coarse words, and could not imagine what would come
        of it. But the words were spoken, and Alexey Alexandrovitch had gone
        away without saying anything. &ldquo;I saw Vronsky and did not tell him.
        At the very instant he was going away I would have turned him back and
        told him, but I changed my mind, because it was strange that I had not
        told him the first minute. Why was it I wanted to tell him and did not
        tell him?&rdquo; And in answer to this question a burning blush of shame
        spread over her face. She knew what had kept her from it, she knew that
        she had been ashamed. Her position, which had seemed to her simplified
        the night before, suddenly struck her now as not only not simple, but as
        absolutely hopeless. She felt terrified at the disgrace, of which she
        had not ever thought before. Directly she thought of what her husband
        would do, the most terrible ideas came to her mind. She had a vision of
        being turned out of the house, of her shame being proclaimed to all the
        world. She asked herself where she should go when she was turned out of
        the house, and she could not find an answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she thought of Vronsky, it seemed to her that he did not love her,
        that he was already beginning to be tired of her, that she could not
        offer herself to him, and she felt bitter against him for it. It seemed
        to her that the words that she had spoken to her husband, and had
        continually repeated in her imagination, she had said to everyone, and
        everyone had heard them. She could not bring herself to look those of
        her own household in the face. She could not bring herself to call her
        maid, and still less go downstairs and see her son and his governess.
      </p>

      <p>
        The maid, who had been listening at her door for a long while, came into
        her room of her own accord. Anna glanced inquiringly into her face, and
        blushed with a scared look. The maid begged her pardon for coming in,
        saying that she had fancied the bell rang. She brought her clothes and a
        note. The note was from Betsy. Betsy reminded her that Liza Merkalova
        and Baroness Shtoltz were coming to play croquet with her that morning
        with their adorers, Kaluzhsky and old Stremov. &ldquo;Come, if only as a
        study in morals. I shall expect you,&rdquo; she finished.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna read the note and heaved a deep sigh.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing, I need nothing,&rdquo; she said to Annushka, who was
        rearranging the bottles and brushes on the dressing table. &ldquo;You
        can go. I&rsquo;ll dress at once and come down. I need nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Annushka went out, but Anna did not begin dressing, and sat in the same
        position, her head and hands hanging listlessly, and every now and then
        she shivered all over, seemed as though she would make some gesture,
        utter some word, and sank back into lifelessness again. She repeated
        continually, &ldquo;My God! my God!&rdquo; But neither &ldquo;God&rdquo;
        nor &ldquo;my&rdquo; had any meaning to her. The idea of seeking help in
        her difficulty in religion was as remote from her as seeking help from
        Alexey Alexandrovitch himself, although she had never had doubts of the
        faith in which she had been brought up. She knew that the support of
        religion was possible only upon condition of renouncing what made up for
        her the whole meaning of life. She was not simply miserable, she began
        to feel alarm at the new spiritual condition, never experienced before,
        in which she found herself. She felt as though everything were beginning
        to be double in her soul, just as objects sometimes appear double to
        over-tired eyes. She hardly knew at times what it was she feared, and
        what she hoped for. Whether she feared or desired what had happened, or
        what was going to happen, and exactly what she longed for, she could not
        have said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, what am I doing!&rdquo; she said to herself, feeling a sudden
        thrill of pain in both sides of her head. When she came to herself, she
        saw that she was holding her hair in both hands, each side of her
        temples, and pulling it. She jumped up, and began walking about.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The coffee is ready, and mademoiselle and Seryozha are
        waiting,&rdquo; said Annushka, coming back again and finding Anna in the
        same position.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Seryozha? What about Seryozha?&rdquo; Anna asked, with sudden
        eagerness, recollecting her son&rsquo;s existence for the first time
        that morning.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been naughty, I think,&rdquo; answered Annushka with a
        smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Some peaches were lying on the table in the corner room. I think
        he slipped in and ate one of them on the sly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The recollection of her son suddenly roused Anna from the helpless
        condition in which she found herself. She recalled the partly sincere,
        though greatly exaggerated, rôle of the mother living for her child,
        which she had taken up of late years, and she felt with joy that in the
        plight in which she found herself she had a support, quite apart from
        her relation to her husband or to Vronsky. This support was her son. In
        whatever position she might be placed, she could not lose her son. Her
        husband might put her to shame and turn her out, Vronsky might grow cold
        to her and go on living his own life apart (she thought of him again
        with bitterness and reproach); she could not leave her son. She had an
        aim in life. And she must act; act to secure this relation to her son,
        so that he might not be taken from her. Quickly indeed, as quickly as
        possible, she must take action before he was taken from her. She must
        take her son and go away. Here was the one thing she had to do now. She
        needed consolation. She must be calm, and get out of this insufferable
        position. The thought of immediate action binding her to her son, of
        going away somewhere with him, gave her this consolation.
      </p>

      <p>
        She dressed quickly, went downstairs, and with resolute steps walked
        into the drawing-room, where she found, as usual, waiting for her, the
        coffee, Seryozha, and his governess. Seryozha, all in white, with his
        back and head bent, was standing at a table under a looking-glass, and
        with an expression of intense concentration which she knew well, and in
        which he resembled his father, he was doing something to the flowers he
        carried.
      </p>

      <p>
        The governess had a particularly severe expression. Seryozha screamed
        shrilly, as he often did, &ldquo;Ah, mamma!&rdquo; and stopped,
        hesitating whether to go to greet his mother and put down the flowers,
        or to finish making the wreath and go with the flowers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The governess, after saying good-morning, began a long and detailed
        account of Seryozha&rsquo;s naughtiness, but Anna did not hear her; she
        was considering whether she would take her with her or not. &ldquo;No, I
        won&rsquo;t take her,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go alone
        with my child.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very wrong,&rdquo; said Anna, and taking her son
        by the shoulder she looked at him, not severely, but with a timid glance
        that bewildered and delighted the boy, and she kissed him. &ldquo;Leave
        him to me,&rdquo; she said to the astonished governess, and not letting
        go of her son, she sat down at the table, where coffee was set ready for
        her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mamma! I ... I ... didn&rsquo;t....&rdquo; he said, trying to
        make out from her expression what was in store for him in regard to the
        peaches.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Seryozha,&rdquo; she said, as soon as the governess had left the
        room, &ldquo;that was wrong, but you&rsquo;ll never do it again, will
        you?... You love me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She felt that the tears were coming into her eyes. &ldquo;Can I help
        loving him?&rdquo; she said to herself, looking deeply into his scared
        and at the same time delighted eyes. &ldquo;And can he ever join his
        father in punishing me? Is it possible he will not feel for me?&rdquo;
        Tears were already flowing down her face, and to hide them she got up
        abruptly and almost ran out on to the terrace.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the thunder showers of the last few days, cold, bright weather had
        set in. The air was cold in the bright sun that filtered through the
        freshly washed leaves.
      </p>

      <p>
        She shivered, both from the cold and from the inward horror which had
        clutched her with fresh force in the open air.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Run along, run along to Mariette,&rdquo; she said to Seryozha,
        who had followed her out, and she began walking up and down on the straw
        matting of the terrace. &ldquo;Can it be that they won&rsquo;t forgive
        me, won&rsquo;t understand how it all couldn&rsquo;t be helped?&rdquo;
        she said to herself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Standing still, and looking at the tops of the aspen trees waving in the
        wind, with their freshly washed, brightly shining leaves in the cold
        sunshine, she knew that they would not forgive her, that everyone and
        everything would be merciless to her now as was that sky, that green.
        And again she felt that everything was split in two in her soul.
        &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t, mustn&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; she said to herself.
        &ldquo;I must get ready. To go where? When? Whom to take with me? Yes,
        to Moscow by the evening train. Annushka and Seryozha, and only the most
        necessary things. But first I must write to them both.&rdquo; She went
        quickly indoors into her boudoir, sat down at the table, and wrote to
        her husband:&mdash;&ldquo;After what has happened, I cannot remain any
        longer in your house. I am going away, and taking my son with me. I
        don&rsquo;t know the law, and so I don&rsquo;t know with which of the
        parents the son should remain; but I take him with me because I cannot
        live without him. Be generous, leave him to me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Up to this point she wrote rapidly and naturally, but the appeal to his
        generosity, a quality she did not recognize in him, and the necessity of
        winding up the letter with something touching, pulled her up. &ldquo;Of
        my fault and my remorse I cannot speak, because....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She stopped again, finding no connection in her ideas. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
        she said to herself, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no need of anything,&rdquo;
        and tearing up the letter, she wrote it again, leaving out the allusion
        to generosity, and sealed it up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another letter had to be written to Vronsky. &ldquo;I have told my
        husband,&rdquo; she wrote, and she sat a long while unable to write
        more. It was so coarse, so unfeminine. &ldquo;And what more am I to
        write to him?&rdquo; she said to herself. Again a flush of shame spread
        over her face; she recalled his composure, and a feeling of anger
        against him impelled her to tear the sheet with the phrase she had
        written into tiny bits. &ldquo;No need of anything,&rdquo; she said to
        herself, and closing her blotting-case she went upstairs, told the
        governess and the servants that she was going that day to Moscow, and at
        once set to work to pack up her things.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 16</h3>

      <p>
        All the rooms of the summer villa were full of porters, gardeners, and
        footmen going to and fro carrying out things. Cupboards and chests were
        open; twice they had sent to the shop for cord; pieces of newspaper were
        tossing about on the floor. Two trunks, some bags and strapped-up rugs,
        had been carried down into the hall. The carriage and two hired cabs
        were waiting at the steps. Anna, forgetting her inward agitation in the
        work of packing, was standing at a table in her boudoir, packing her
        traveling bag, when Annushka called her attention to the rattle of some
        carriage driving up. Anna looked out of the window and saw Alexey
        Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s courier on the steps, ringing at the front door
        bell.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Run and find out what it is,&rdquo; she said, and with a calm
        sense of being prepared for anything, she sat down in a low chair,
        folding her hands on her knees. A footman brought in a thick packet
        directed in Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The courier has orders to wait for an answer,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said, and as soon as he had left the room
        she tore open the letter with trembling fingers. A roll of unfolded
        notes done up in a wrapper fell out of it. She disengaged the letter and
        began reading it at the end. &ldquo;Preparations shall be made for your
        arrival here ... I attach particular significance to
        compliance....&rdquo; she read. She ran on, then back, read it all
        through, and once more read the letter all through again from the
        beginning. When she had finished, she felt that she was cold all over,
        and that a fearful calamity, such as she had not expected, had burst
        upon her.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the morning she had regretted that she had spoken to her husband, and
        wished for nothing so much as that those words could be unspoken. And
        here this letter regarded them as unspoken, and gave her what she had
        wanted. But now this letter seemed to her more awful than anything she
        had been able to conceive.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;of course, he&rsquo;s
        always right; he&rsquo;s a Christian, he&rsquo;s generous! Yes, vile,
        base creature! And no one understands it except me, and no one ever
        will; and I can&rsquo;t explain it. They say he&rsquo;s so religious, so
        high-principled, so upright, so clever; but they don&rsquo;t see what
        I&rsquo;ve seen. They don&rsquo;t know how he has crushed my life for
        eight years, crushed everything that was living in me&mdash;he has not
        once even thought that I&rsquo;m a live woman who must have love. They
        don&rsquo;t know how at every step he&rsquo;s humiliated me, and been
        just as pleased with himself. Haven&rsquo;t I striven, striven with all
        my strength, to find something to give meaning to my life? Haven&rsquo;t
        I struggled to love him, to love my son when I could not love my
        husband? But the time came when I knew that I couldn&rsquo;t cheat
        myself any longer, that I was alive, that I was not to blame, that God
        has made me so that I must love and live. And now what does he do? If
        he&rsquo;d killed me, if he&rsquo;d killed him, I could have borne
        anything, I could have forgiven anything; but, no, he.... How was it I
        didn&rsquo;t guess what he would do? He&rsquo;s doing just what&rsquo;s
        characteristic of his mean character. He&rsquo;ll keep himself in the
        right, while me, in my ruin, he&rsquo;ll drive still lower to worse ruin
        yet....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She recalled the words from the letter. &ldquo;You can conjecture what
        awaits you and your son....&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a threat to take
        away my child, and most likely by their stupid law he can. But I know
        very well why he says it. He doesn&rsquo;t believe even in my love for
        my child, or he despises it (just as he always used to ridicule it). He
        despises that feeling in me, but he knows that I won&rsquo;t abandon my
        child, that I can&rsquo;t abandon my child, that there could be no life
        for me without my child, even with him whom I love; but that if I
        abandoned my child and ran away from him, I should be acting like the
        most infamous, basest of women. He knows that, and knows that I am
        incapable of doing that.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She recalled another sentence in the letter. &ldquo;Our life must go on
        as it has done in the past....&rdquo; &ldquo;That life was miserable
        enough in the old days; it has been awful of late. What will it be now?
        And he knows all that; he knows that I can&rsquo;t repent that I
        breathe, that I love; he knows that it can lead to nothing but lying and
        deceit; but he wants to go on torturing me. I know him; I know that
        he&rsquo;s at home and is happy in deceit, like a fish swimming in the
        water. No, I won&rsquo;t give him that happiness. I&rsquo;ll break
        through the spiderweb of lies in which he wants to catch me, come what
        may. Anything&rsquo;s better than lying and deceit.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But how? My God! my God! Was ever a woman so miserable as I
        am?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; I will break through it, I will break through it!&rdquo; she
        cried, jumping up and keeping back her tears. And she went to the
        writing-table to write him another letter. But at the bottom of her
        heart she felt that she was not strong enough to break through anything,
        that she was not strong enough to get out of her old position, however
        false and dishonorable it might be.
      </p>

      <p>
        She sat down at the writing-table, but instead of writing she clasped
        her hands on the table, and, laying her head on them, burst into tears,
        with sobs and heaving breast like a child crying. She was weeping that
        her dream of her position being made clear and definite had been
        annihilated forever. She knew beforehand that everything would go on in
        the old way, and far worse, indeed, than in the old way. She felt that
        the position in the world that she enjoyed, and that had seemed to her
        of so little consequence in the morning, that this position was precious
        to her, that she would not have the strength to exchange it for the
        shameful position of a woman who has abandoned husband and child to join
        her lover; that however much she might struggle, she could not be
        stronger than herself. She would never know freedom in love, but would
        remain forever a guilty wife, with the menace of detection hanging over
        her at every instant; deceiving her husband for the sake of a shameful
        connection with a man living apart and away from her, whose life she
        could never share. She knew that this was how it would be, and at the
        same time it was so awful that she could not even conceive what it would
        end in. And she cried without restraint, as children cry when they are
        punished.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sound of the footman&rsquo;s steps forced her to rouse herself, and,
        hiding her face from him, she pretended to be writing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The courier asks if there&rsquo;s an answer,&rdquo; the footman
        announced.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;An answer? Yes,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;Let him wait. I&rsquo;ll
        ring.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What can I write?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;What can I decide
        upon alone? What do I know? What do I want? What is there I care
        for?&rdquo; Again she felt that her soul was beginning to be split in
        two. She was terrified again at this feeling, and clutched at the first
        pretext for doing something which might divert her thoughts from
        herself. &ldquo;I ought to see Alexey&rdquo; (so she called Vronsky in
        her thoughts); &ldquo;no one but he can tell me what I ought to do.
        I&rsquo;ll go to Betsy&rsquo;s, perhaps I shall see him there,&rdquo;
        she said to herself, completely forgetting that when she had told him
        the day before that she was not going to Princess Tverskaya&rsquo;s, he
        had said that in that case he should not go either. She went up to the
        table, wrote to her husband, &ldquo;I have received your
        letter.&mdash;A.&rdquo;; and, ringing the bell, gave it to the footman.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We are not going,&rdquo; she said to Annushka, as she came in.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not going at all?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; don&rsquo;t unpack till tomorrow, and let the carriage wait.
        I&rsquo;m going to the princess&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Which dress am I to get ready?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 17</h3>

      <p>
        The croquet party to which the Princess Tverskaya had invited Anna was
        to consist of two ladies and their adorers. These two ladies were the
        chief representatives of a select new Petersburg circle, nicknamed, in
        imitation of some imitation, <i>les sept merveilles du monde</i>. These
        ladies belonged to a circle which, though of the highest society, was
        utterly hostile to that in which Anna moved. Moreover, Stremov, one of
        the most influential people in Petersburg, and the elderly admirer of
        Liza Merkalova, was Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s enemy in the political
        world. From all these considerations Anna had not meant to go, and the
        hints in Princess Tverskaya&rsquo;s note referred to her refusal. But
        now Anna was eager to go, in the hope of seeing Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna arrived at Princess Tverskaya&rsquo;s earlier than the other
        guests.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same moment as she entered, Vronsky&rsquo;s footman, with
        side-whiskers combed out like a <i>Kammerjunker</i>, went in too. He
        stopped at the door, and, taking off his cap, let her pass. Anna
        recognized him, and only then recalled that Vronsky had told her the day
        before that he would not come. Most likely he was sending a note to say
        so.
      </p>

      <p>
        As she took off her outer garment in the hall, she heard the footman,
        pronouncing his &ldquo;<i>r&rsquo;s</i>&rdquo; even like a
        <i>Kammerjunker</i>, say, &ldquo;From the count for the princess,&rdquo;
        and hand the note.
      </p>

      <p>
        She longed to question him as to where his master was. She longed to
        turn back and send him a letter to come and see her, or to go herself to
        see him. But neither the first nor the second nor the third course was
        possible. Already she heard bells ringing to announce her arrival ahead
        of her, and Princess Tverskaya&rsquo;s footman was standing at the open
        door waiting for her to go forward into the inner rooms.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The princess is in the garden; they will inform her immediately.
        Would you be pleased to walk into the garden?&rdquo; announced another
        footman in another room.
      </p>

      <p>
        The position of uncertainty, of indecision, was still the same as at
        home&mdash;worse, in fact, since it was impossible to take any step,
        impossible to see Vronsky, and she had to remain here among outsiders,
        in company so uncongenial to her present mood. But she was wearing a
        dress that she knew suited her. She was not alone; all around was that
        luxurious setting of idleness that she was used to, and she felt less
        wretched than at home. She was not forced to think what she was to do.
        Everything would be done of itself. On meeting Betsy coming towards her
        in a white gown that struck her by its elegance, Anna smiled at her just
        as she always did. Princess Tverskaya was walking with Tushkevitch and a
        young lady, a relation, who, to the great joy of her parents in the
        provinces, was spending the summer with the fashionable princess.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was probably something unusual about Anna, for Betsy noticed it at
        once.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I slept badly,&rdquo; answered Anna, looking intently at the
        footman who came to meet them, and, as she supposed, brought
        Vronsky&rsquo;s note.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How glad I am you&rsquo;ve come!&rdquo; said Betsy.
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired, and was just longing to have some tea before
        they come. You might go&rdquo;&mdash;she turned to
        Tushkevitch&mdash;&ldquo;with Masha, and try the croquet ground over
        there where they&rsquo;ve been cutting it. We shall have time to talk a
        little over tea; we&rsquo;ll have a cozy chat, eh?&rdquo; she said in
        English to Anna, with a smile, pressing the hand with which she held a
        parasol.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, especially as I can&rsquo;t stay very long with you.
        I&rsquo;m forced to go on to old Madame Vrede. I&rsquo;ve been promising
        to go for a century,&rdquo; said Anna, to whom lying, alien as it was to
        her nature, had become not merely simple and natural in society, but a
        positive source of satisfaction. Why she said this, which she had not
        thought of a second before, she could not have explained. She had said
        it simply from the reflection that as Vronsky would not be here, she had
        better secure her own freedom, and try to see him somehow. But why she
        had spoken of old Madame Vrede, whom she had to go and see, as she had
        to see many other people, she could not have explained; and yet, as it
        afterwards turned out, had she contrived the most cunning devices to
        meet Vronsky, she could have thought of nothing better.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not going to let you go for anything,&rdquo;
        answered Betsy, looking intently into Anna&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Really,
        if I were not fond of you, I should feel offended. One would think you
        were afraid my society would compromise you. Tea in the little
        dining-room, please,&rdquo; she said, half closing her eyes, as she
        always did when addressing the footman.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taking the note from him, she read it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey&rsquo;s playing us false,&rdquo; she said in French;
        &ldquo;he writes that he can&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; she added in a tone as
        simple and natural as though it could never enter her head that Vronsky
        could mean anything more to Anna than a game of croquet. Anna knew that
        Betsy knew everything, but, hearing how she spoke of Vronsky before her,
        she almost felt persuaded for a minute that she knew nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Anna indifferently, as though not greatly
        interested in the matter, and she went on smiling: &ldquo;How can you or
        your friends compromise anyone?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This playing with words, this hiding of a secret, had a great
        fascination for Anna, as, indeed, it has for all women. And it was not
        the necessity of concealment, not the aim with which the concealment was
        contrived, but the process of concealment itself which attracted her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be more Catholic than the Pope,&rdquo; she said.
        &ldquo;Stremov and Liza Merkalova, why, they&rsquo;re the cream of the
        cream of society. Besides, they&rsquo;re received everywhere, and
        <i>I</i>&rdquo;&mdash;she laid special stress on the I&mdash;&ldquo;have
        never been strict and intolerant. It&rsquo;s simply that I haven&rsquo;t
        the time.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; you don&rsquo;t care, perhaps, to meet Stremov? Let him and
        Alexey Alexandrovitch tilt at each other in the
        committee&mdash;that&rsquo;s no affair of ours. But in the world,
        he&rsquo;s the most amiable man I know, and a devoted croquet player.
        You shall see. And, in spite of his absurd position as Liza&rsquo;s
        lovesick swain at his age, you ought to see how he carries off the
        absurd position. He&rsquo;s very nice. Sappho Shtoltz you don&rsquo;t
        know? Oh, that&rsquo;s a new type, quite new.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Betsy said all this, and, at the same time, from her good-humored,
        shrewd glance, Anna felt that she partly guessed her plight, and was
        hatching something for her benefit. They were in the little boudoir.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I must write to Alexey though,&rdquo; and Betsy sat down to the
        table, scribbled a few lines, and put the note in an envelope.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling him to come to dinner. I&rsquo;ve one lady
        extra to dinner with me, and no man to take her in. Look what I&rsquo;ve
        said, will that persuade him? Excuse me, I must leave you for a minute.
        Would you seal it up, please, and send it off?&rdquo; she said from the
        door; &ldquo;I have to give some directions.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Without a moment&rsquo;s thought, Anna sat down to the table with
        Betsy&rsquo;s letter, and, without reading it, wrote below:
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s essential for me to see you. Come to the Vrede garden.
        I shall be there at six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; She sealed it up, and,
        Betsy coming back, in her presence handed the note to be taken.
      </p>

      <p>
        At tea, which was brought them on a little tea-table in the cool little
        drawing-room, the cozy chat promised by Princess Tverskaya before the
        arrival of her visitors really did come off between the two women. They
        criticized the people they were expecting, and the conversation fell
        upon Liza Merkalova.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s very sweet, and I always liked her,&rdquo; said Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You ought to like her. She raves about you. Yesterday she came up
        to me after the races and was in despair at not finding you. She says
        you&rsquo;re a real heroine of romance, and that if she were a man she
        would do all sorts of mad things for your sake. Stremov says she does
        that as it is.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But do tell me, please, I never could make it out,&rdquo; said
        Anna, after being silent for some time, speaking in a tone that showed
        she was not asking an idle question, but that what she was asking was of
        more importance to her than it should have been; &ldquo;do tell me,
        please, what are her relations with Prince Kaluzhsky, Mishka, as
        he&rsquo;s called? I&rsquo;ve met them so little. What does it
        mean?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Betsy smiled with her eyes, and looked intently at Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new manner,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
        all adopted that manner. They&rsquo;ve flung their caps over the
        windmills. But there are ways and ways of flinging them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but what are her relations precisely with Kaluzhsky?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Betsy broke into unexpectedly mirthful and irrepressible laughter, a
        thing which rarely happened with her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re encroaching on Princess Myakaya&rsquo;s special
        domain now. That&rsquo;s the question of an
        <i>enfant terrible</i>,&rdquo; and Betsy obviously tried to restrain
        herself, but could not, and went off into peals of that infectious
        laughter that people laugh who do not laugh often. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
        better ask them,&rdquo; she brought out, between tears of laughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; you laugh,&rdquo; said Anna, laughing too in spite of
        herself, &ldquo;but I never could understand it. I can&rsquo;t
        understand the husband&rsquo;s rôle in it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The husband? Liza Merkalova&rsquo;s husband carries her shawl,
        and is always ready to be of use. But anything more than that in
        reality, no one cares to inquire. You know in decent society one
        doesn&rsquo;t talk or think even of certain details of the toilet.
        That&rsquo;s how it is with this.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you be at Madame Rolandak&rsquo;s fête?&rdquo; asked Anna,
        to change the conversation.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; answered Betsy, and, without
        looking at her friend, she began filling the little transparent cups
        with fragrant tea. Putting a cup before Anna, she took out a cigarette,
        and, fitting it into a silver holder, she lighted it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this, you see: I&rsquo;m in a fortunate
        position,&rdquo; she began, quite serious now, as she took up her cup.
        &ldquo;I understand you, and I understand Liza. Liza now is one of those
        naïve natures that, like children, don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s good
        and what&rsquo;s bad. Anyway, she didn&rsquo;t comprehend it when she
        was very young. And now she&rsquo;s aware that the lack of comprehension
        suits her. Now, perhaps, she doesn&rsquo;t know on purpose,&rdquo; said
        Betsy, with a subtle smile. &ldquo;But, anyway, it suits her. The very
        same thing, don&rsquo;t you see, may be looked at tragically, and turned
        into a misery, or it may be looked at simply and even humorously.
        Possibly you are inclined to look at things too tragically.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How I should like to know other people just as I know
        myself!&rdquo; said Anna, seriously and dreamily. &ldquo;Am I worse than
        other people, or better? I think I&rsquo;m worse.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Enfant terrible, enfant terrible!</i>&rdquo; repeated Betsy.
        &ldquo;But here they are.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 18</h3>

      <p>
        They heard the sound of steps and a man&rsquo;s voice, then a
        woman&rsquo;s voice and laughter, and immediately thereafter there
        walked in the expected guests: Sappho Shtoltz, and a young man beaming
        with excess of health, the so-called Vaska. It was evident that ample
        supplies of beefsteak, truffles, and Burgundy never failed to reach him
        at the fitting hour. Vaska bowed to the two ladies, and glanced at them,
        but only for one second. He walked after Sappho into the drawing-room,
        and followed her about as though he were chained to her, keeping his
        sparkling eyes fixed on her as though he wanted to eat her. Sappho
        Shtoltz was a blonde beauty with black eyes. She walked with smart
        little steps in high-heeled shoes, and shook hands with the ladies
        vigorously like a man.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna had never met this new star of fashion, and was struck by her
        beauty, the exaggerated extreme to which her dress was carried, and the
        boldness of her manners. On her head there was such a superstructure of
        soft, golden hair&mdash;her own and false mixed&mdash;that her head was
        equal in size to the elegantly rounded bust, of which so much was
        exposed in front. The impulsive abruptness of her movements was such
        that at every step the lines of her knees and the upper part of her legs
        were distinctly marked under her dress, and the question involuntarily
        rose to the mind where in the undulating, piled-up mountain of material
        at the back the real body of the woman, so small and slender, so naked
        in front, and so hidden behind and below, really came to an end.
      </p>

      <p>
        Betsy made haste to introduce her to Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Only fancy, we all but ran over two soldiers,&rdquo; she began
        telling them at once, using her eyes, smiling and twitching away her
        tail, which she flung back at one stroke all on one side. &ldquo;I drove
        here with Vaska.... Ah, to be sure, you don&rsquo;t know each
        other.&rdquo; And mentioning his surname she introduced the young man,
        and reddening a little, broke into a ringing laugh at her
        mistake&mdash;that is, at her having called him Vaska to a stranger.
        Vaska bowed once more to Anna, but he said nothing to her. He addressed
        Sappho: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lost your bet. We got here first. Pay
        up,&rdquo; said he, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sappho laughed still more festively.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not just now,&rdquo; said she.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, all right, I&rsquo;ll have it later.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, very well. Oh, yes.&rdquo; She turned suddenly to
        Princess Betsy: &ldquo;I am a nice person ... I positively forgot it ...
        I&rsquo;ve brought you a visitor. And here he comes.&rdquo; The
        unexpected young visitor, whom Sappho had invited, and whom she had
        forgotten, was, however, a personage of such consequence that, in spite
        of his youth, both the ladies rose on his entrance.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was a new admirer of Sappho&rsquo;s. He now dogged her footsteps,
        like Vaska.
      </p>

      <p>
        Soon after Prince Kaluzhsky arrived, and Liza Merkalova with Stremov.
        Liza Merkalova was a thin brunette, with an Oriental, languid type of
        face, and&mdash;as everyone used to say&mdash;exquisite enigmatic eyes.
        The tone of her dark dress (Anna immediately observed and appreciated
        the fact) was in perfect harmony with her style of beauty. Liza was as
        soft and enervated as Sappho was smart and abrupt.
      </p>

      <p>
        But to Anna&rsquo;s taste Liza was far more attractive. Betsy had said
        to Anna that she had adopted the pose of an innocent child, but when
        Anna saw her, she felt that this was not the truth. She really was both
        innocent and corrupt, but a sweet and passive woman. It is true that her
        tone was the same as Sappho&rsquo;s; that like Sappho, she had two men,
        one young and one old, tacked onto her, and devouring her with their
        eyes. But there was something in her higher than what surrounded her.
        There was in her the glow of the real diamond among glass imitations.
        This glow shone out in her exquisite, truly enigmatic eyes. The weary,
        and at the same time passionate, glance of those eyes, encircled by dark
        rings, impressed one by its perfect sincerity. Everyone looking into
        those eyes fancied he knew her wholly, and knowing her, could not but
        love her. At the sight of Anna, her whole face lighted up at once with a
        smile of delight.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, how glad I am to see you!&rdquo; she said, going up to her.
        &ldquo;Yesterday at the races all I wanted was to get to you, but
        you&rsquo;d gone away. I did so want to see you, yesterday especially.
        Wasn&rsquo;t it awful?&rdquo; she said, looking at Anna with eyes that
        seemed to lay bare all her soul.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; I had no idea it would be so thrilling,&rdquo; said Anna,
        blushing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The company got up at this moment to go into the garden.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going,&rdquo; said Liza, smiling and settling
        herself close to Anna. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go either, will you? Who
        wants to play croquet?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I like it,&rdquo; said Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There, how do you manage never to be bored by things? It&rsquo;s
        delightful to look at you. You&rsquo;re alive, but I&rsquo;m
        bored.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How can you be bored? Why, you live in the liveliest set in
        Petersburg,&rdquo; said Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Possibly the people who are not of our set are even more bored;
        but we&mdash;I certainly&mdash;are not happy, but awfully, awfully
        bored.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Sappho smoking a cigarette went off into the garden with the two young
        men. Betsy and Stremov remained at the tea-table.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What, bored!&rdquo; said Betsy. &ldquo;Sappho says they did enjoy
        themselves tremendously at your house last night.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, how dreary it all was!&rdquo; said Liza Merkalova. &ldquo;We
        all drove back to my place after the races. And always the same people,
        always the same. Always the same thing. We lounged about on sofas all
        the evening. What is there to enjoy in that? No; do tell me how you
        manage never to be bored?&rdquo; she said, addressing Anna again.
        &ldquo;One has but to look at you and one sees, here&rsquo;s a woman who
        may be happy or unhappy, but isn&rsquo;t bored. Tell me how you do
        it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I do nothing,&rdquo; answered Anna, blushing at these searching
        questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best way,&rdquo; Stremov put in. Stremov was a
        man of fifty, partly gray, but still vigorous-looking, very ugly, but
        with a characteristic and intelligent face. Liza Merkalova was his
        wife&rsquo;s niece, and he spent all his leisure hours with her. On
        meeting Anna Karenina, as he was Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s enemy in
        the government, he tried, like a shrewd man and a man of the world, to
        be particularly cordial with her, the wife of his enemy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo;&rdquo; he put in with a subtle smile,
        &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the very best way. I told you long ago,&rdquo; he
        said, turning to Liza Merkalova, &ldquo;that if you don&rsquo;t want to
        be bored, you mustn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to be bored.
        It&rsquo;s just as you mustn&rsquo;t be afraid of not being able to fall
        asleep, if you&rsquo;re afraid of sleeplessness. That&rsquo;s just what
        Anna Arkadyevna has just said.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I should be very glad if I had said it, for it&rsquo;s not only
        clever but true,&rdquo; said Anna, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, do tell me why it is one can&rsquo;t go to sleep, and one
        can&rsquo;t help being bored?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To sleep well one ought to work, and to enjoy oneself one ought
        to work too.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What am I to work for when my work is no use to anybody? And I
        can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t knowingly make a pretense about it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re incorrigible,&rdquo; said Stremov, not looking at
        her, and he spoke again to Anna. As he rarely met Anna, he could say
        nothing but commonplaces to her, but he said those commonplaces as to
        when she was returning to Petersburg, and how fond Countess Lidia
        Ivanovna was of her, with an expression which suggested that he longed
        with his whole soul to please her and show his regard for her and even
        more than that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tushkevitch came in, announcing that the party were awaiting the other
        players to begin croquet.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t go away, please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; pleaded Liza
        Merkalova, hearing that Anna was going. Stremov joined in her
        entreaties.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too violent a transition,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to go
        from such company to old Madame Vrede. And besides, you will only give
        her a chance for talking scandal, while here you arouse none but such
        different feelings of the highest and most opposite kind,&rdquo; he said
        to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna pondered for an instant in uncertainty. This shrewd man&rsquo;s
        flattering words, the naïve, childlike affection shown her by Liza
        Merkalova, and all the social atmosphere she was used to,&mdash;it was
        all so easy, and what was in store for her was so difficult, that she
        was for a minute in uncertainty whether to remain, whether to put off a
        little longer the painful moment of explanation. But remembering what
        was in store for her alone at home, if she did not come to some
        decision, remembering that gesture&mdash;terrible even in
        memory&mdash;when she had clutched her hair in both hands&mdash;she said
        good-bye and went away.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 19</h3>

      <p>
        In spite of Vronsky&rsquo;s apparently frivolous life in society, he was
        a man who hated irregularity. In early youth in the Corps of Pages, he
        had experienced the humiliation of a refusal, when he had tried, being
        in difficulties, to borrow money, and since then he had never once put
        himself in the same position again.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to keep his affairs in some sort of order, he used about five
        times a year (more or less frequently, according to circumstances) to
        shut himself up alone and put all his affairs into definite shape. This
        he used to call his day of reckoning or <i>faire la lessive</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        On waking up the day after the races, Vronsky put on a white linen coat,
        and without shaving or taking his bath, he distributed about the table
        moneys, bills, and letters, and set to work. Petritsky, who knew he was
        ill-tempered on such occasions, on waking up and seeing his comrade at
        the writing-table, quietly dressed and went out without getting in his
        way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every man who knows to the minutest details all the complexity of the
        conditions surrounding him, cannot help imagining that the complexity of
        these conditions, and the difficulty of making them clear, is something
        exceptional and personal, peculiar to himself, and never supposes that
        others are surrounded by just as complicated an array of personal
        affairs as he is. So indeed it seemed to Vronsky. And not without inward
        pride, and not without reason, he thought that any other man would long
        ago have been in difficulties, would have been forced to some
        dishonorable course, if he had found himself in such a difficult
        position. But Vronsky felt that now especially it was essential for him
        to clear up and define his position if he were to avoid getting into
        difficulties.
      </p>

      <p>
        What Vronsky attacked first as being the easiest was his pecuniary
        position. Writing out on note paper in his minute hand all that he owed,
        he added up the amount and found that his debts amounted to seventeen
        thousand and some odd hundreds, which he left out for the sake of
        clearness. Reckoning up his money and his bank book, he found that he
        had left one thousand eight hundred roubles, and nothing coming in
        before the New Year. Reckoning over again his list of debts, Vronsky
        copied it, dividing it into three classes. In the first class he put the
        debts which he would have to pay at once, or for which he must in any
        case have the money ready so that on demand for payment there could not
        be a moment&rsquo;s delay in paying. Such debts amounted to about four
        thousand: one thousand five hundred for a horse, and two thousand five
        hundred as surety for a young comrade, Venovsky, who had lost that sum
        to a cardsharper in Vronsky&rsquo;s presence. Vronsky had wanted to pay
        the money at the time (he had that amount then), but Venovsky and
        Yashvin had insisted that they would pay and not Vronsky, who had not
        played. That was so far well, but Vronsky knew that in this dirty
        business, though his only share in it was undertaking by word of mouth
        to be surety for Venovsky, it was absolutely necessary for him to have
        the two thousand five hundred roubles so as to be able to fling it at
        the swindler, and have no more words with him. And so for this first and
        most important division he must have four thousand roubles. The second
        class&mdash;eight thousand roubles&mdash;consisted of less important
        debts. These were principally accounts owing in connection with his race
        horses, to the purveyor of oats and hay, the English saddler, and so on.
        He would have to pay some two thousand roubles on these debts too, in
        order to be quite free from anxiety. The last class of debts&mdash;to
        shops, to hotels, to his tailor&mdash;were such as need not be
        considered. So that he needed at least six thousand roubles for current
        expenses, and he only had one thousand eight hundred. For a man with one
        hundred thousand roubles of revenue, which was what everyone fixed as
        Vronsky&rsquo;s income, such debts, one would suppose, could hardly be
        embarrassing; but the fact was that he was far from having one hundred
        thousand. His father&rsquo;s immense property, which alone yielded a
        yearly income of two hundred thousand, was left undivided between the
        brothers. At the time when the elder brother, with a mass of debts,
        married Princess Varya Tchirkova, the daughter of a Decembrist without
        any fortune whatever, Alexey had given up to his elder brother almost
        the whole income from his father&rsquo;s estate, reserving for himself
        only twenty-five thousand a year from it. Alexey had said at the time to
        his brother that that sum would be sufficient for him until he married,
        which he probably never would do. And his brother, who was in command of
        one of the most expensive regiments, and was only just married, could
        not decline the gift. His mother, who had her own separate property, had
        allowed Alexey every year twenty thousand in addition to the twenty-five
        thousand he had reserved, and Alexey had spent it all. Of late his
        mother, incensed with him on account of his love affair and his leaving
        Moscow, had given up sending him the money. And in consequence of this,
        Vronsky, who had been in the habit of living on the scale of forty-five
        thousand a year, having only received twenty thousand that year, found
        himself now in difficulties. To get out of these difficulties, he could
        not apply to his mother for money. Her last letter, which he had
        received the day before, had particularly exasperated him by the hints
        in it that she was quite ready to help him to succeed in the world and
        in the army, but not to lead a life which was a scandal to all good
        society. His mother&rsquo;s attempt to buy him stung him to the quick
        and made him feel colder than ever to her. But he could not draw back
        from the generous word when it was once uttered, even though he felt
        now, vaguely foreseeing certain eventualities in his intrigue with
        Madame Karenina, that this generous word had been spoken thoughtlessly,
        and that even though he were not married he might need all the hundred
        thousand of income. But it was impossible to draw back. He had only to
        recall his brother&rsquo;s wife, to remember how that sweet, delightful
        Varya sought, at every convenient opportunity, to remind him that she
        remembered his generosity and appreciated it, to grasp the impossibility
        of taking back his gift. It was as impossible as beating a woman,
        stealing, or lying. One thing only could and ought to be done, and
        Vronsky determined upon it without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation: to
        borrow money from a money-lender, ten thousand roubles, a proceeding
        which presented no difficulty, to cut down his expenses generally, and
        to sell his race horses. Resolving on this, he promptly wrote a note to
        Rolandak, who had more than once sent to him with offers to buy horses
        from him. Then he sent for the Englishman and the money-lender, and
        divided what money he had according to the accounts he intended to pay.
        Having finished this business, he wrote a cold and cutting answer to his
        mother. Then he took out of his notebook three notes of Anna&rsquo;s,
        read them again, burned them, and remembering their conversation on the
        previous day, he sank into meditation.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 20</h3>

      <p>
        Vronsky&rsquo;s life was particularly happy in that he had a code of
        principles, which defined with unfailing certitude what he ought and
        what he ought not to do. This code of principles covered only a very
        small circle of contingencies, but then the principles were never
        doubtful, and Vronsky, as he never went outside that circle, had never
        had a moment&rsquo;s hesitation about doing what he ought to do. These
        principles laid down as invariable rules: that one must pay a
        cardsharper, but need not pay a tailor; that one must never tell a lie
        to a man, but one may to a woman; that one must never cheat anyone, but
        one may a husband; that one must never pardon an insult, but one may
        give one and so on. These principles were possibly not reasonable and
        not good, but they were of unfailing certainty, and so long as he
        adhered to them, Vronsky felt that his heart was at peace and he could
        hold his head up. Only quite lately in regard to his relations with
        Anna, Vronsky had begun to feel that his code of principles did not
        fully cover all possible contingencies, and to foresee in the future
        difficulties and perplexities for which he could find no guiding clue.
      </p>

      <p>
        His present relation to Anna and to her husband was to his mind clear
        and simple. It was clearly and precisely defined in the code of
        principles by which he was guided.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was an honorable woman who had bestowed her love upon him, and he
        loved her, and therefore she was in his eyes a woman who had a right to
        the same, or even more, respect than a lawful wife. He would have had
        his hand chopped off before he would have allowed himself by a word, by
        a hint, to humiliate her, or even to fall short of the fullest respect a
        woman could look for.
      </p>

      <p>
        His attitude to society, too, was clear. Everyone might know, might
        suspect it, but no one might dare to speak of it. If any did so, he was
        ready to force all who might speak to be silent and to respect the
        non-existent honor of the woman he loved.
      </p>

      <p>
        His attitude to the husband was the clearest of all. From the moment
        that Anna loved Vronsky, he had regarded his own right over her as the
        one thing unassailable. Her husband was simply a superfluous and
        tiresome person. No doubt he was in a pitiable position, but how could
        that be helped? The one thing the husband had a right to was to demand
        satisfaction with a weapon in his hand, and Vronsky was prepared for
        this at any minute.
      </p>

      <p>
        But of late new inner relations had arisen between him and her, which
        frightened Vronsky by their indefiniteness. Only the day before she had
        told him that she was with child. And he felt that this fact and what
        she expected of him called for something not fully defined in that code
        of principles by which he had hitherto steered his course in life. And
        he had been indeed caught unawares, and at the first moment when she
        spoke to him of her position, his heart had prompted him to beg her to
        leave her husband. He had said that, but now thinking things over he saw
        clearly that it would be better to manage to avoid that; and at the same
        time, as he told himself so, he was afraid whether it was not wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If I told her to leave her husband, that must mean uniting her
        life with mine; am I prepared for that? How can I take her away now,
        when I have no money? Supposing I could arrange.... But how can I take
        her away while I&rsquo;m in the service? If I say that&mdash;I ought to
        be prepared to do it, that is, I ought to have the money and to retire
        from the army.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he grew thoughtful. The question whether to retire from the service
        or not brought him to the other and perhaps the chief though hidden
        interest of his life, of which none knew but he.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ambition was the old dream of his youth and childhood, a dream which he
        did not confess even to himself, though it was so strong that now this
        passion was even doing battle with his love. His first steps in the
        world and in the service had been successful, but two years before he
        had made a great mistake. Anxious to show his independence and to
        advance, he had refused a post that had been offered him, hoping that
        this refusal would heighten his value; but it turned out that he had
        been too bold, and he was passed over. And having, whether he liked or
        not, taken up for himself the position of an independent man, he carried
        it off with great tact and good sense, behaving as though he bore no
        grudge against anyone, did not regard himself as injured in any way, and
        cared for nothing but to be left alone since he was enjoying himself. In
        reality he had ceased to enjoy himself as long ago as the year before,
        when he went away to Moscow. He felt that this independent attitude of a
        man who might have done anything, but cared to do nothing, was already
        beginning to pall, that many people were beginning to fancy that he was
        not really capable of anything but being a straightforward, good-natured
        fellow. His connection with Madame Karenina, by creating so much
        sensation and attracting general attention, had given him a fresh
        distinction which soothed his gnawing worm of ambition for a while, but
        a week before that worm had been roused up again with fresh force. The
        friend of his childhood, a man of the same set, of the same coterie, his
        comrade in the Corps of Pages, Serpuhovskoy, who had left school with
        him and had been his rival in class, in gymnastics, in their scrapes and
        their dreams of glory, had come back a few days before from Central
        Asia, where he had gained two steps up in rank, and an order rarely
        bestowed upon generals so young.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as he arrived in Petersburg, people began to talk about him as a
        newly risen star of the first magnitude. A schoolfellow of
        Vronsky&rsquo;s and of the same age, he was a general and was expecting
        a command, which might have influence on the course of political events;
        while Vronsky, independent and brilliant and beloved by a charming woman
        though he was, was simply a cavalry captain who was readily allowed to
        be as independent as ever he liked. &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t envy
        Serpuhovskoy and never could envy him; but his advancement shows me that
        one has only to watch one&rsquo;s opportunity, and the career of a man
        like me may be very rapidly made. Three years ago he was in just the
        same position as I am. If I retire, I burn my ships. If I remain in the
        army, I lose nothing. She said herself she did not wish to change her
        position. And with her love I cannot feel envious of
        Serpuhovskoy.&rdquo; And slowly twirling his mustaches, he got up from
        the table and walked about the room. His eyes shone particularly
        brightly, and he felt in that confident, calm, and happy frame of mind
        which always came after he had thoroughly faced his position. Everything
        was straight and clear, just as after former days of reckoning. He
        shaved, took a cold bath, dressed and went out.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 21</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to fetch you. Your <i>lessive</i> lasted a good
        time today,&rdquo; said Petritsky. &ldquo;Well, is it over?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It is over,&rdquo; answered Vronsky, smiling with his eyes only,
        and twirling the tips of his mustaches as circumspectly as though after
        the perfect order into which his affairs had been brought any over-bold
        or rapid movement might disturb it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always just as if you&rsquo;d come out of a bath
        after it,&rdquo; said Petritsky. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come from
        Gritsky&rsquo;s&rdquo; (that was what they called the colonel);
        &ldquo;they&rsquo;re expecting you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky, without answering, looked at his comrade, thinking of something
        else.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; is that music at his place?&rdquo; he said, listening to the
        familiar sounds of polkas and waltzes floating across to him.
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the fête?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Serpuhovskoy&rsquo;s come.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said Vronsky, &ldquo;why, I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The smile in his eyes gleamed more brightly than ever.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having once made up his mind that he was happy in his love, that he
        sacrificed his ambition to it&mdash;having anyway taken up this
        position, Vronsky was incapable of feeling either envious of
        Serpuhovskoy or hurt with him for not coming first to him when he came
        to the regiment. Serpuhovskoy was a good friend, and he was delighted he
        had come.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m very glad!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The colonel, Demin, had taken a large country house. The whole party
        were in the wide lower balcony. In the courtyard the first objects that
        met Vronsky&rsquo;s eyes were a band of singers in white linen coats,
        standing near a barrel of vodka, and the robust, good-humored figure of
        the colonel surrounded by officers. He had gone out as far as the first
        step of the balcony and was loudly shouting across the band that played
        Offenbach&rsquo;s quadrille, waving his arms and giving some orders to a
        few soldiers standing on one side. A group of soldiers, a quartermaster,
        and several subalterns came up to the balcony with Vronsky. The colonel
        returned to the table, went out again onto the steps with a tumbler in
        his hand, and proposed the toast, &ldquo;To the health of our former
        comrade, the gallant general, Prince Serpuhovskoy. Hurrah!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The colonel was followed by Serpuhovskoy, who came out onto the steps
        smiling, with a glass in his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You always get younger, Bondarenko,&rdquo; he said to the
        rosy-checked, smart-looking quartermaster standing just before him,
        still youngish looking though doing his second term of service.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was three years since Vronsky had seen Serpuhovskoy. He looked more
        robust, had let his whiskers grow, but was still the same graceful
        creature, whose face and figure were even more striking from their
        softness and nobility than their beauty. The only change Vronsky
        detected in him was that subdued, continual radiance of beaming content
        which settles on the faces of men who are successful and are sure of the
        recognition of their success by everyone. Vronsky knew that radiant air,
        and immediately observed it in Serpuhovskoy.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Serpuhovskoy came down the steps he saw Vronsky. A smile of pleasure
        lighted up his face. He tossed his head upwards and waved the glass in
        his hand, greeting Vronsky, and showing him by the gesture that he could
        not come to him before the quartermaster, who stood craning forward his
        lips ready to be kissed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo; shouted the colonel. &ldquo;Yashvin told me
        you were in one of your gloomy tempers.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Serpuhovskoy kissed the moist, fresh lips of the gallant-looking
        quartermaster, and wiping his mouth with his handkerchief, went up to
        Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How glad I am!&rdquo; he said, squeezing his hand and drawing him
        on one side.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You look after him,&rdquo; the colonel shouted to Yashvin,
        pointing to Vronsky; and he went down below to the soldiers.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why weren&rsquo;t you at the races yesterday? I expected to see
        you there,&rdquo; said Vronsky, scrutinizing Serpuhovskoy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I did go, but late. I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he added, and he
        turned to the adjutant: &ldquo;Please have this divided from me, each
        man as much as it runs to.&rdquo; And he hurriedly took notes for three
        hundred roubles from his pocketbook, blushing a little.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Vronsky! Have anything to eat or drink?&rdquo; asked Yashvin.
        &ldquo;Hi, something for the count to eat! Ah, here it is: have a
        glass!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The fête at the colonel&rsquo;s lasted a long while. There was a great
        deal of drinking. They tossed Serpuhovskoy in the air and caught him
        again several times. Then they did the same to the colonel. Then, to the
        accompaniment of the band, the colonel himself danced with Petritsky.
        Then the colonel, who began to show signs of feebleness, sat down on a
        bench in the courtyard and began demonstrating to Yashvin the
        superiority of Russia over Prussia, especially in cavalry attack, and
        there was a lull in the revelry for a moment. Serpuhovskoy went into the
        house to the bathroom to wash his hands and found Vronsky there; Vronsky
        was drenching his head with water. He had taken off his coat and put his
        sunburnt, hairy neck under the tap, and was rubbing it and his head with
        his hands. When he had finished, Vronsky sat down by Serpuhovskoy. They
        both sat down in the bathroom on a lounge, and a conversation began
        which was very interesting to both of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been hearing about you through my wife,&rdquo;
        said Serpuhovskoy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve been seeing her
        pretty often.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s friendly with Varya, and they&rsquo;re the only women
        in Petersburg I care about seeing,&rdquo; answered Vronsky, smiling. He
        smiled because he foresaw the topic the conversation would turn on, and
        he was glad of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The only ones?&rdquo; Serpuhovskoy queried, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; and I heard news of you, but not only through your
        wife,&rdquo; said Vronsky, checking his hint by a stern expression of
        face. &ldquo;I was greatly delighted to hear of your success, but not a
        bit surprised. I expected even more.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Serpuhovskoy smiled. Such an opinion of him was obviously agreeable to
        him, and he did not think it necessary to conceal it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I on the contrary expected less&mdash;I&rsquo;ll own
        frankly. But I&rsquo;m glad, very glad. I&rsquo;m ambitious;
        that&rsquo;s my weakness, and I confess to it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t confess to it if you hadn&rsquo;t been
        successful,&rdquo; said Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose so,&rdquo; said Serpuhovskoy, smiling
        again. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say life wouldn&rsquo;t be worth living
        without it, but it would be dull. Of course I may be mistaken, but I
        fancy I have a certain capacity for the line I&rsquo;ve chosen, and that
        power of any sort in my hands, if it is to be, will be better than in
        the hands of a good many people I know,&rdquo; said Serpuhovskoy, with
        beaming consciousness of success; &ldquo;and so the nearer I get to it,
        the better pleased I am.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps that is true for you, but not for everyone. I used to
        think so too, but here I live and think life worth living not only for
        that.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There it&rsquo;s out! here it comes!&rdquo; said Serpuhovskoy,
        laughing. &ldquo;Ever since I heard about you, about your refusal, I
        began.... Of course, I approved of what you did. But there are ways of
        doing everything. And I think your action was good in itself, but you
        didn&rsquo;t do it quite in the way you ought to have done.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be undone, and you know I never go
        back on what I&rsquo;ve done. And besides, I&rsquo;m very well
        off.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well off&mdash;for the time. But you&rsquo;re not satisfied
        with that. I wouldn&rsquo;t say this to your brother. He&rsquo;s a nice
        child, like our host here. There he goes!&rdquo; he added, listening to
        the roar of &ldquo;hurrah!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;and he&rsquo;s happy, but
        that does not satisfy you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say it did satisfy me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but that&rsquo;s not the only thing. Such men as you are
        wanted.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;By whom? By society, by Russia. Russia needs men; she needs a
        party, or else everything goes and will go to the dogs.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you mean? Bertenev&rsquo;s party against the Russian
        communists?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Serpuhovskoy, frowning with vexation at being
        suspected of such an absurdity. &ldquo;<i>Tout ça est une blague</i>.
        That&rsquo;s always been and always will be. There are no communists.
        But intriguing people have to invent a noxious, dangerous party.
        It&rsquo;s an old trick. No, what&rsquo;s wanted is a powerful party of
        independent men like you and me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But why so?&rdquo; Vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power.
        &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t they independent men?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Simply because they have not, or have not had from birth, an
        independent fortune; they&rsquo;ve not had a name, they&rsquo;ve not
        been close to the sun and center as we have. They can be bought either
        by money or by favor. And they have to find a support for themselves in
        inventing a policy. And they bring forward some notion, some policy that
        they don&rsquo;t believe in, that does harm; and the whole policy is
        really only a means to a government house and so much income.
        <i>Cela n&rsquo;est pas plus fin que ça</i>, when you get a peep at
        their cards. I may be inferior to them, stupider perhaps, though I
        don&rsquo;t see why I should be inferior to them. But you and I have one
        important advantage over them for certain, in being more difficult to
        buy. And such men are more needed than ever.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky listened attentively, but he was not so much interested by the
        meaning of the words as by the attitude of Serpuhovskoy who was already
        contemplating a struggle with the existing powers, and already had his
        likes and dislikes in that higher world, while his own interest in the
        governing world did not go beyond the interests of his regiment. Vronsky
        felt, too, how powerful Serpuhovskoy might become through his
        unmistakable faculty for thinking things out and for taking things in,
        through his intelligence and gift of words, so rarely met with in the
        world in which he moved. And, ashamed as he was of the feeling, he felt
        envious.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Still I haven&rsquo;t the one thing of most importance for
        that,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the desire for power. I
        had it once, but it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, that&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; said Serpuhovskoy,
        smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it is true, it is true ... now!&rdquo; Vronsky added, to be
        truthful.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s true now, that&rsquo;s another thing; but that
        <i>now</i> won&rsquo;t last forever.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; answered Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You say <i>perhaps</i>,&rdquo; Serpuhovskoy went on, as though
        guessing his thoughts, &ldquo;but I say <i>for certain</i>. And
        that&rsquo;s what I wanted to see you for. Your action was just what it
        should have been. I see that, but you ought not to keep it up. I only
        ask you to give me <i>carte blanche</i>. I&rsquo;m not going to offer
        you my protection ... though, indeed, why shouldn&rsquo;t I protect
        you?&mdash;you&rsquo;ve protected me often enough! I should hope our
        friendship rises above all that sort of thing. Yes,&rdquo; he said,
        smiling to him as tenderly as a woman, &ldquo;give me
        <i>carte blanche</i>, retire from the regiment, and I&rsquo;ll draw you
        upwards imperceptibly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you must understand that I want nothing,&rdquo; said Vronsky,
        &ldquo;except that all should be as it is.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Serpuhovskoy got up and stood facing him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You say that all should be as it is. I understand what that
        means. But listen: we&rsquo;re the same age, you&rsquo;ve known a
        greater number of women perhaps than I have.&rdquo; Serpohovskoy&rsquo;s
        smile and gestures told Vronsky that he mustn&rsquo;t be afraid, that he
        would be tender and careful in touching the sore place. &ldquo;But
        I&rsquo;m married, and believe me, in getting to know thoroughly
        one&rsquo;s wife, if one loves her, as someone has said, one gets to
        know all women better than if one knew thousands of them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming directly!&rdquo; Vronsky shouted to an
        officer, who looked into the room and called them to the colonel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky was longing now to hear to the end and know what Serpuhovskey
        would say to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s my opinion for you. Women are the chief
        stumbling block in a man&rsquo;s career. It&rsquo;s hard to love a woman
        and do anything. There&rsquo;s only one way of having love conveniently
        without its being a hindrance&mdash;that&rsquo;s marriage. How, how am I
        to tell you what I mean?&rdquo; said Serpuhovskoy, who liked similes.
        &ldquo;Wait a minute, wait a minute! Yes, just as you can only carry a
        <i>fardeau</i> and do something with your hands, when the
        <i>fardeau</i> is tied on your back, and that&rsquo;s marriage. And
        that&rsquo;s what I felt when I was married. My hands were suddenly set
        free. But to drag that <i>fardeau</i> about with you without marriage,
        your hands will always be so full that you can do nothing. Look at
        Mazankov, at Krupov. They&rsquo;ve ruined their careers for the sake of
        women.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What women!&rdquo; said Vronsky, recalling the Frenchwoman and
        the actress with whom the two men he had mentioned were connected.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The firmer the woman&rsquo;s footing in society, the worse it is.
        That&rsquo;s much the same as&mdash;not merely carrying the
        <i>fardeau</i> in your arms&mdash;but tearing it away from someone
        else.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You have never loved,&rdquo; Vronsky said softly, looking
        straight before him and thinking of Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps. But you remember what I&rsquo;ve said to you. And
        another thing, women are all more materialistic than men. We make
        something immense out of love, but they are always
        <i>terre-à-terre</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Directly, directly!&rdquo; he cried to a footman who came in. But
        the footman had not come to call them again, as he supposed. The footman
        brought Vronsky a note.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A man brought it from Princess Tverskaya.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky opened the letter, and flushed crimson.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My head&rsquo;s begun to ache; I&rsquo;m going home,&rdquo; he
        said to Serpuhovskoy.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, good-bye then. You give me <i>carte blanche!</i>&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about it later on; I&rsquo;ll look you up in
        Petersburg.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 22</h3>

      <p>
        It was six o&rsquo;clock already, and so, in order to be there quickly,
        and at the same time not to drive with his own horses, known to
        everyone, Vronsky got into Yashvin&rsquo;s hired fly, and told the
        driver to drive as quickly as possible. It was a roomy, old-fashioned
        fly, with seats for four. He sat in one corner, stretched his legs out
        on the front seat, and sank into meditation.
      </p>

      <p>
        A vague sense of the order into which his affairs had been brought, a
        vague recollection of the friendliness and flattery of Serpuhovskoy, who
        had considered him a man that was needed, and most of all, the
        anticipation of the interview before him&mdash;all blended into a
        general, joyous sense of life. This feeling was so strong that he could
        not help smiling. He dropped his legs, crossed one leg over the other
        knee, and taking it in his hand, felt the springy muscle of the calf,
        where it had been grazed the day before by his fall, and leaning back he
        drew several deep breaths.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy, very happy!&rdquo; he said to himself. He had
        often before had this sense of physical joy in his own body, but he had
        never felt so fond of himself, of his own body, as at that moment. He
        enjoyed the slight ache in his strong leg, he enjoyed the muscular
        sensation of movement in his chest as he breathed. The bright, cold
        August day, which had made Anna feel so hopeless, seemed to him keenly
        stimulating, and refreshed his face and neck that still tingled from the
        cold water. The scent of brilliantine on his whiskers struck him as
        particularly pleasant in the fresh air. Everything he saw from the
        carriage window, everything in that cold pure air, in the pale light of
        the sunset, was as fresh, and gay, and strong as he was himself: the
        roofs of the houses shining in the rays of the setting sun, the sharp
        outlines of fences and angles of buildings, the figures of passers-by,
        the carriages that met him now and then, the motionless green of the
        trees and grass, the fields with evenly drawn furrows of potatoes, and
        the slanting shadows that fell from the houses, and trees, and bushes,
        and even from the rows of potatoes&mdash;everything was bright like a
        pretty landscape just finished and freshly varnished.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Get on, get on!&rdquo; he said to the driver, putting his head
        out of the window, and pulling a three-rouble note out of his pocket he
        handed it to the man as he looked round. The driver&rsquo;s hand fumbled
        with something at the lamp, the whip cracked, and the carriage rolled
        rapidly along the smooth highroad.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I want nothing, nothing but this happiness,&rdquo; he thought,
        staring at the bone button of the bell in the space between the windows,
        and picturing to himself Anna just as he had seen her last time.
        &ldquo;And as I go on, I love her more and more. Here&rsquo;s the garden
        of the Vrede Villa. Whereabouts will she be? Where? How? Why did she fix
        on this place to meet me, and why does she write in Betsy&rsquo;s
        letter?&rdquo; he thought, wondering now for the first time at it. But
        there was now no time for wonder. He called to the driver to stop before
        reaching the avenue, and opening the door, jumped out of the carriage as
        it was moving, and went into the avenue that led up to the house. There
        was no one in the avenue; but looking round to the right he caught sight
        of her. Her face was hidden by a veil, but he drank in with glad eyes
        the special movement in walking, peculiar to her alone, the slope of the
        shoulders, and the setting of the head, and at once a sort of electric
        shock ran all over him. With fresh force, he felt conscious of himself
        from the springy motions of his legs to the movements of his lungs as he
        breathed, and something set his lips twitching.
      </p>

      <p>
        Joining him, she pressed his hand tightly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not angry that I sent for you? I absolutely had to
        see you,&rdquo; she said; and the serious and set line of her lips,
        which he saw under the veil, transformed his mood at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I angry! But how have you come, where from?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; she said, laying her hand on his, &ldquo;come
        along, I must talk to you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He saw that something had happened, and that the interview would not be
        a joyous one. In her presence he had no will of his own: without knowing
        the grounds of her distress, he already felt the same distress
        unconsciously passing over him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it? what?&rdquo; he asked her, squeezing her hand with
        his elbow, and trying to read her thoughts in her face.
      </p>

      <p>
        She walked on a few steps in silence, gathering up her courage; then
        suddenly she stopped.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I did not tell you yesterday,&rdquo; she began, breathing quickly
        and painfully, &ldquo;that coming home with Alexey Alexandrovitch I told
        him everything ... told him I could not be his wife, that ... and told
        him everything.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He heard her, unconsciously bending his whole figure down to her as
        though hoping in this way to soften the hardness of her position for
        her. But directly she had said this he suddenly drew himself up, and a
        proud and hard expression came over his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, that&rsquo;s better, a thousand times better! I know
        how painful it was,&rdquo; he said. But she was not listening to his
        words, she was reading his thoughts from the expression of his face. She
        could not guess that that expression arose from the first idea that
        presented itself to Vronsky&mdash;that a duel was now inevitable. The
        idea of a duel had never crossed her mind, and so she put a different
        interpretation on this passing expression of hardness.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she got her husband&rsquo;s letter, she knew then at the bottom of
        her heart that everything would go on in the old way, that she would not
        have the strength of will to forego her position, to abandon her son,
        and to join her lover. The morning spent at Princess Tverskaya&rsquo;s
        had confirmed her still more in this. But this interview was still of
        the utmost gravity for her. She hoped that this interview would
        transform her position, and save her. If on hearing this news he were to
        say to her resolutely, passionately, without an instant&rsquo;s
        wavering: &ldquo;Throw up everything and come with me!&rdquo; she would
        give up her son and go away with him. But this news had not produced
        what she had expected in him; he simply seemed as though he were
        resenting some affront.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It was not in the least painful to me. It happened of
        itself,&rdquo; she said irritably; &ldquo;and see....&rdquo; she pulled
        her husband&rsquo;s letter out of her glove.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I understand, I understand,&rdquo; he interrupted her, taking the
        letter, but not reading it, and trying to soothe her. &ldquo;The one
        thing I longed for, the one thing I prayed for, was to cut short this
        position, so as to devote my life to your happiness.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why do you tell me that?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you suppose I
        can doubt it? If I doubted....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that coming?&rdquo; said Vronsky suddenly, pointing
        to two ladies walking towards them. &ldquo;Perhaps they know us!&rdquo;
        and he hurriedly turned off, drawing her after him into a side path.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; she said. Her lips were quivering.
        And he fancied that her eyes looked with strange fury at him from under
        the veil. &ldquo;I tell you that&rsquo;s not the point&mdash;I
        can&rsquo;t doubt that; but see what he writes to me. Read it.&rdquo;
        She stood still again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again, just as at the first moment of hearing of her rupture with her
        husband, Vronsky, on reading the letter, was unconsciously carried away
        by the natural sensation aroused in him by his own relation to the
        betrayed husband. Now while he held his letter in his hands, he could
        not help picturing the challenge, which he would most likely find at
        home today or tomorrow, and the duel itself, in which, with the same
        cold and haughty expression that his face was assuming at this moment he
        would await the injured husband&rsquo;s shot, after having himself fired
        into the air. And at that instant there flashed across his mind the
        thought of what Serpuhovskoy had just said to him, and what he had
        himself been thinking in the morning&mdash;that it was better not to
        bind himself&mdash;and he knew that this thought he could not tell her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having read the letter, he raised his eyes to her, and there was no
        determination in them. She saw at once that he had been thinking about
        it before by himself. She knew that whatever he might say to her, he
        would not say all he thought. And she knew that her last hope had failed
        her. This was not what she had been reckoning on.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You see the sort of man he is,&rdquo; she said, with a shaking
        voice; &ldquo;he....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Forgive me, but I rejoice at it,&rdquo; Vronsky interrupted.
        &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, let me finish!&rdquo; he added, his eyes
        imploring her to give him time to explain his words. &ldquo;I rejoice,
        because things cannot, cannot possibly remain as he supposes.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Anna said, restraining her tears,
        and obviously attaching no sort of consequence to what he said. She felt
        that her fate was sealed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky meant that after the duel&mdash;inevitable, he
        thought&mdash;things could not go on as before, but he said something
        different.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t go on. I hope that now you will leave him. I
        hope&rdquo;&mdash;he was confused, and reddened&mdash;&ldquo;that you
        will let me arrange and plan our life. Tomorrow....&rdquo; he was
        beginning.
      </p>

      <p>
        She did not let him go on.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But my child!&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;You see what he writes!
        I should have to leave him, and I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t do
        that.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But, for God&rsquo;s sake, which is better?&mdash;leave your
        child, or keep up this degrading position?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To whom is it degrading?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To all, and most of all to you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You say degrading ... don&rsquo;t say that. Those words have no
        meaning for me,&rdquo; she said in a shaking voice. She did not want him
        now to say what was untrue. She had nothing left her but his love, and
        she wanted to love him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand that from the
        day I loved you everything has changed for me? For me there is one
        thing, and one thing only&mdash;your love. If that&rsquo;s mine, I feel
        so exalted, so strong, that nothing can be humiliating to me. I am proud
        of my position, because ... proud of being ... proud....&rdquo; She
        could not say what she was proud of. Tears of shame and despair choked
        her utterance. She stood still and sobbed.
      </p>

      <p>
        He felt, too, something swelling in his throat and twitching in his
        nose, and for the first time in his life he felt on the point of
        weeping. He could not have said exactly what it was touched him so. He
        felt sorry for her, and he felt he could not help her, and with that he
        knew that he was to blame for her wretchedness, and that he had done
        something wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is not a divorce possible?&rdquo; he said feebly. She shook her
        head, not answering. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you take your son, and still
        leave him?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but it all depends on him. Now I must go to him,&rdquo; she
        said shortly. Her presentiment that all would again go on in the old way
        had not deceived her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;On Tuesday I shall be in Petersburg, and everything can be
        settled.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t let us talk any more
        of it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna&rsquo;s carriage, which she had sent away, and ordered to come back
        to the little gate of the Vrede garden, drove up. Anna said good-bye to
        Vronsky, and drove home.

      <h3>Chapter 23</h3>

      <p>
        On Monday there was the usual sitting of the Commission of the 2nd of
        June. Alexey Alexandrovitch walked into the hall where the sitting was
        held, greeted the members and the president, as usual, and sat down in
        his place, putting his hand on the papers laid ready before him. Among
        these papers lay the necessary evidence and a rough outline of the
        speech he intended to make. But he did not really need these documents.
        He remembered every point, and did not think it necessary to go over in
        his memory what he would say. He knew that when the time came, and when
        he saw his enemy facing him, and studiously endeavoring to assume an
        expression of indifference, his speech would flow of itself better than
        he could prepare it now. He felt that the import of his speech was of
        such magnitude that every word of it would have weight. Meantime, as he
        listened to the usual report, he had the most innocent and inoffensive
        air. No one, looking at his white hands, with their swollen veins and
        long fingers, so softly stroking the edges of the white paper that lay
        before him, and at the air of weariness with which his head drooped on
        one side, would have suspected that in a few minutes a torrent of words
        would flow from his lips that would arouse a fearful storm, set the
        members shouting and attacking one another, and force the president to
        call for order. When the report was over, Alexey Alexandrovitch
        announced in his subdued, delicate voice that he had several points to
        bring before the meeting in regard to the Commission for the
        Reorganization of the Native Tribes. All attention was turned upon him.
        Alexey Alexandrovitch cleared his throat, and not looking at his
        opponent, but selecting, as he always did while he was delivering his
        speeches, the first person sitting opposite him, an inoffensive little
        old man, who never had an opinion of any sort in the Commission, began
        to expound his views. When he reached the point about the fundamental
        and radical law, his opponent jumped up and began to protest. Stremov,
        who was also a member of the Commission, and also stung to the quick,
        began defending himself, and altogether a stormy sitting followed; but
        Alexey Alexandrovitch triumphed, and his motion was carried, three new
        commissions were appointed, and the next day in a certain Petersburg
        circle nothing else was talked of but this sitting. Alexey
        Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s success had been even greater than he had
        anticipated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next morning, Tuesday, Alexey Alexandrovitch, on waking up, recollected
        with pleasure his triumph of the previous day, and he could not help
        smiling, though he tried to appear indifferent, when the chief secretary
        of his department, anxious to flatter him, informed him of the rumors
        that had reached him concerning what had happened in the Commission.
      </p>

      <p>
        Absorbed in business with the chief secretary, Alexey Alexandrovitch had
        completely forgotten that it was Tuesday, the day fixed by him for the
        return of Anna Arkadyevna, and he was surprised and received a shock of
        annoyance when a servant came in to inform him of her arrival.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna had arrived in Petersburg early in the morning; the carriage had
        been sent to meet her in accordance with her telegram, and so Alexey
        Alexandrovitch might have known of her arrival. But when she arrived, he
        did not meet her. She was told that he had not yet gone out, but was
        busy with his secretary. She sent word to her husband that she had come,
        went to her own room, and occupied herself in sorting out her things,
        expecting he would come to her. But an hour passed; he did not come. She
        went into the dining-room on the pretext of giving some directions, and
        spoke loudly on purpose, expecting him to come out there; but he did not
        come, though she heard him go to the door of his study as he parted from
        the chief secretary. She knew that he usually went out quickly to his
        office, and she wanted to see him before that, so that their attitude to
        one another might be defined.
      </p>

      <p>
        She walked across the drawing-room and went resolutely to him. When she
        went into his study he was in official uniform, obviously ready to go
        out, sitting at a little table on which he rested his elbows, looking
        dejectedly before him. She saw him before he saw her, and she saw that
        he was thinking of her.
      </p>

      <p>
        On seeing her, he would have risen, but changed his mind, then his face
        flushed hotly&mdash;a thing Anna had never seen before, and he got up
        quickly and went to meet her, looking not at her eyes, but above them at
        her forehead and hair. He went up to her, took her by the hand, and
        asked her to sit down.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very glad you have come,&rdquo; he said, sitting down beside
        her, and obviously wishing to say something, he stuttered. Several times
        he tried to begin to speak, but stopped. In spite of the fact that,
        preparing herself for meeting him, she had schooled herself to despise
        and reproach him, she did not know what to say to him, and she felt
        sorry for him. And so the silence lasted for some time. &ldquo;Is
        Seryozha quite well?&rdquo; he said, and not waiting for an answer, he
        added: &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be dining at home today, and I have got to
        go out directly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I had thought of going to Moscow,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, you did quite, quite right to come,&rdquo; he said, and was
        silent again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seeing that he was powerless to begin the conversation, she began
        herself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey Alexandrovitch,&rdquo; she said, looking at him and not
        dropping her eyes under his persistent gaze at her hair,
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a guilty woman, I&rsquo;m a bad woman, but I am the
        same as I was, as I told you then, and I have come to tell you that I
        can change nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have asked you no question about that,&rdquo; he said, all at
        once, resolutely and with hatred looking her straight in the face;
        &ldquo;that was as I had supposed.&rdquo; Under the influence of anger
        he apparently regained complete possession of all his faculties.
        &ldquo;But as I told you then, and have written to you,&rdquo; he said
        in a thin, shrill voice, &ldquo;I repeat now, that I am not bound to
        know this. I ignore it. Not all wives are so kind as you, to be in such
        a hurry to communicate such agreeable news to their husbands.&rdquo; He
        laid special emphasis on the word &ldquo;agreeable.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
        shall ignore it so long as the world knows nothing of it, so long as my
        name is not disgraced. And so I simply inform you that our relations
        must be just as they have always been, and that only in the event of
        your compromising me I shall be obliged to take steps to secure my
        honor.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But our relations cannot be the same as always,&rdquo; Anna began
        in a timid voice, looking at him with dismay.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she saw once more those composed gestures, heard that shrill,
        childish, and sarcastic voice, her aversion for him extinguished her
        pity for him, and she felt only afraid, but at all costs she wanted to
        make clear her position.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot be your wife while I....&rdquo; she began.
      </p>

      <p>
        He laughed a cold and malignant laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The manner of life you have chosen is reflected, I suppose, in
        your ideas. I have too much respect or contempt, or both ... I respect
        your past and despise your present ... that I was far from the
        interpretation you put on my words.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna sighed and bowed her head.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Though indeed I fail to comprehend how, with the independence you
        show,&rdquo; he went on, getting hot, &ldquo;&mdash;announcing your
        infidelity to your husband and seeing nothing reprehensible in it,
        apparently&mdash;you can see anything reprehensible in performing a
        wife&rsquo;s duties in relation to your husband.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey Alexandrovitch! What is it you want of me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I want you not to meet that man here, and to conduct yourself so
        that neither the world nor the servants can reproach you ... not to see
        him. That&rsquo;s not much, I think. And in return you will enjoy all
        the privileges of a faithful wife without fulfilling her duties.
        That&rsquo;s all I have to say to you. Now it&rsquo;s time for me to go.
        I&rsquo;m not dining at home.&rdquo; He got up and moved towards the
        door.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna got up too. Bowing in silence, he let her pass before him.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 24</h3>

      <p>
        The night spent by Levin on the haycock did not pass without result for
        him. The way in which he had been managing his land revolted him and had
        lost all attraction for him. In spite of the magnificent harvest, never
        had there been, or, at least, never it seemed to him, had there been so
        many hindrances and so many quarrels between him and the peasants as
        that year, and the origin of these failures and this hostility was now
        perfectly comprehensible to him. The delight he had experienced in the
        work itself, and the consequent greater intimacy with the peasants, the
        envy he felt of them, of their life, the desire to adopt that life,
        which had been to him that night not a dream but an intention, the
        execution of which he had thought out in detail&mdash;all this had so
        transformed his view of the farming of the land as he had managed it,
        that he could not take his former interest in it, and could not help
        seeing that unpleasant relation between him and the workpeople which was
        the foundation of it all. The herd of improved cows such as Pava, the
        whole land ploughed over and enriched, the nine level fields surrounded
        with hedges, the two hundred and forty acres heavily manured, the seed
        sown in drills, and all the rest of it&mdash;it was all splendid if only
        the work had been done for themselves, or for themselves and
        comrades&mdash;people in sympathy with them. But he saw clearly now (his
        work on a book of agriculture, in which the chief element in husbandry
        was to have been the laborer, greatly assisted him in this) that the
        sort of farming he was carrying on was nothing but a cruel and stubborn
        struggle between him and the laborers, in which there was on one
        side&mdash;his side&mdash;a continual intense effort to change
        everything to a pattern he considered better; on the other side, the
        natural order of things. And in this struggle he saw that with immense
        expenditure of force on his side, and with no effort or even intention
        on the other side, all that was attained was that the work did not go to
        the liking of either side, and that splendid tools, splendid cattle and
        land were spoiled with no good to anyone. Worst of all, the energy
        expended on this work was not simply wasted. He could not help feeling
        now, since the meaning of this system had become clear to him, that the
        aim of his energy was a most unworthy one. In reality, what was the
        struggle about? He was struggling for every farthing of his share (and
        he could not help it, for he had only to relax his efforts, and he would
        not have had the money to pay his laborers&rsquo; wages), while they
        were only struggling to be able to do their work easily and agreeably,
        that is to say, as they were used to doing it. It was for his interests
        that every laborer should work as hard as possible, and that while doing
        so he should keep his wits about him, so as to try not to break the
        winnowing machines, the horse rakes, the thrashing machines, that he
        should attend to what he was doing. What the laborer wanted was to work
        as pleasantly as possible, with rests, and above all, carelessly and
        heedlessly, without thinking. That summer Levin saw this at every step.
        He sent the men to mow some clover for hay, picking out the worst
        patches where the clover was overgrown with grass and weeds and of no
        use for seed; again and again they mowed the best acres of clover,
        justifying themselves by the pretense that the bailiff had told them to,
        and trying to pacify him with the assurance that it would be splendid
        hay; but he knew that it was owing to those acres being so much easier
        to mow. He sent out a hay machine for pitching the hay&mdash;it was
        broken at the first row because it was dull work for a peasant to sit on
        the seat in front with the great wings waving above him. And he was
        told, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble, your honor, sure, the womenfolks will
        pitch it quick enough.&rdquo; The ploughs were practically useless,
        because it never occurred to the laborer to raise the share when he
        turned the plough, and forcing it round, he strained the horses and tore
        up the ground, and Levin was begged not to mind about it. The horses
        were allowed to stray into the wheat because not a single laborer would
        consent to be night-watchman, and in spite of orders to the contrary,
        the laborers insisted on taking turns for night duty, and Ivan, after
        working all day long, fell asleep, and was very penitent for his fault,
        saying, &ldquo;Do what you will to me, your honor.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        They killed three of the best calves by letting them into the clover
        aftermath without care as to their drinking, and nothing would make the
        men believe that they had been blown out by the clover, but they told
        him, by way of consolation, that one of his neighbors had lost a hundred
        and twelve head of cattle in three days. All this happened, not because
        anyone felt ill-will to Levin or his farm; on the contrary, he knew that
        they liked him, thought him a simple gentleman (their highest praise);
        but it happened simply because all they wanted was to work merrily and
        carelessly, and his interests were not only remote and incomprehensible
        to them, but fatally opposed to their most just claims. Long before,
        Levin had felt dissatisfaction with his own position in regard to the
        land. He saw where his boat leaked, but he did not look for the leak,
        perhaps purposely deceiving himself. (Nothing would be left him if he
        lost faith in it.) But now he could deceive himself no longer. The
        farming of the land, as he was managing it, had become not merely
        unattractive but revolting to him, and he could take no further interest
        in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        To this now was joined the presence, only twenty-five miles off, of
        Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, whom he longed to see and could not see. Darya
        Alexandrovna Oblonskaya had invited him, when he was over there, to
        come; to come with the object of renewing his offer to her sister, who
        would, so she gave him to understand, accept him now. Levin himself had
        felt on seeing Kitty Shtcherbatskaya that he had never ceased to love
        her; but he could not go over to the Oblonskys&rsquo;, knowing she was
        there. The fact that he had made her an offer, and she had refused him,
        had placed an insuperable barrier between her and him. &ldquo;I
        can&rsquo;t ask her to be my wife merely because she can&rsquo;t be the
        wife of the man she wanted to marry,&rdquo; he said to himself. The
        thought of this made him cold and hostile to her. &ldquo;I should not be
        able to speak to her without a feeling of reproach; I could not look at
        her without resentment; and she will only hate me all the more, as
        she&rsquo;s bound to. And besides, how can I now, after what Darya
        Alexandrovna told me, go to see them? Can I help showing that I know
        what she told me? And me to go magnanimously to forgive her, and have
        pity on her! Me go through a performance before her of forgiving, and
        deigning to bestow my love on her!... What induced Darya Alexandrovna to
        tell me that? By chance I might have seen her, then everything would
        have happened of itself; but, as it is, it&rsquo;s out of the question,
        out of the question!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna sent him a letter, asking him for a side-saddle for
        Kitty&rsquo;s use. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told you have a side-saddle,&rdquo;
        she wrote to him; &ldquo;I hope you will bring it over yourself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This was more than he could stand. How could a woman of any
        intelligence, of any delicacy, put her sister in such a humiliating
        position! He wrote ten notes, and tore them all up, and sent the saddle
        without any reply. To write that he would go was impossible, because he
        could not go; to write that he could not come because something
        prevented him, or that he would be away, that was still worse. He sent
        the saddle without an answer, and with a sense of having done something
        shameful; he handed over all the now revolting business of the estate to
        the bailiff, and set off next day to a remote district to see his friend
        Sviazhsky, who had splendid marshes for grouse in his neighborhood, and
        had lately written to ask him to keep a long-standing promise to stay
        with him. The grouse-marsh, in the Surovsky district, had long tempted
        Levin, but he had continually put off this visit on account of his work
        on the estate. Now he was glad to get away from the neighborhood of the
        Shtcherbatskys, and still more from his farm work, especially on a
        shooting expedition, which always in trouble served as the best
        consolation.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 25</h3>

      <p>
        In the Surovsky district there was no railway nor service of post
        horses, and Levin drove there with his own horses in his big,
        old-fashioned carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        He stopped halfway at a well-to-do peasant&rsquo;s to feed his horses. A
        bald, well-preserved old man, with a broad, red beard, gray on his
        cheeks, opened the gate, squeezing against the gatepost to let the three
        horses pass. Directing the coachman to a place under the shed in the
        big, clean, tidy yard, with charred, old-fashioned ploughs in it, the
        old man asked Levin to come into the parlor. A cleanly dressed young
        woman, with clogs on her bare feet, was scrubbing the floor in the new
        outer room. She was frightened of the dog, that ran in after Levin, and
        uttered a shriek, but began laughing at her own fright at once when she
        was told the dog would not hurt her. Pointing Levin with her bare arm to
        the door into the parlor, she bent down again, hiding her handsome face,
        and went on scrubbing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Would you like the samovar?&rdquo; she asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The parlor was a big room, with a Dutch stove, and a screen dividing it
        into two. Under the holy pictures stood a table painted in patterns, a
        bench, and two chairs. Near the entrance was a dresser full of crockery.
        The shutters were closed, there were few flies, and it was so clean that
        Levin was anxious that Laska, who had been running along the road and
        bathing in puddles, should not muddy the floor, and ordered her to a
        place in the corner by the door. After looking round the parlor, Levin
        went out in the back yard. The good-looking young woman in clogs,
        swinging the empty pails on the yoke, ran on before him to the well for
        water.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Look sharp, my girl!&rdquo; the old man shouted after her,
        good-humoredly, and he went up to Levin. &ldquo;Well, sir, are you going
        to Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky? His honor comes to us too,&rdquo; he
        began, chatting, leaning his elbows on the railing of the steps. In the
        middle of the old man&rsquo;s account of his acquaintance with
        Sviazhsky, the gates creaked again, and laborers came into the yard from
        the fields, with wooden ploughs and harrows. The horses harnessed to the
        ploughs and harrows were sleek and fat. The laborers were obviously of
        the household: two were young men in cotton shirts and caps, the two
        others were hired laborers in homespun shirts, one an old man, the other
        a young fellow. Moving off from the steps, the old man went up to the
        horses and began unharnessing them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What have they been ploughing?&rdquo; asked Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ploughing up the potatoes. We rent a bit of land too. Fedot,
        don&rsquo;t let out the gelding, but take it to the trough, and
        we&rsquo;ll put the other in harness.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, father, the ploughshares I ordered, has he brought them
        along?&rdquo; asked the big, healthy-looking fellow, obviously the old
        man&rsquo;s son.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There ... in the outer room,&rdquo; answered the old man,
        bundling together the harness he had taken off, and flinging it on the
        ground. &ldquo;You can put them on, while they have dinner.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The good-looking young woman came into the outer room with the full
        pails dragging at her shoulders. More women came on the scene from
        somewhere, young and handsome, middle-aged, old and ugly, with children
        and without children.
      </p>

      <p>
        The samovar was beginning to sing; the laborers and the family, having
        disposed of the horses, came in to dinner. Levin, getting his provisions
        out of his carriage, invited the old man to take tea with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I have had some today already,&rdquo; said the old man,
        obviously accepting the invitation with pleasure. &ldquo;But just a
        glass for company.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Over their tea Levin heard all about the old man&rsquo;s farming. Ten
        years before, the old man had rented three hundred acres from the lady
        who owned them, and a year ago he had bought them and rented another
        three hundred from a neighboring landowner. A small part of the
        land&mdash;the worst part&mdash;he let out for rent, while a hundred
        acres of arable land he cultivated himself with his family and two hired
        laborers. The old man complained that things were doing badly. But Levin
        saw that he simply did so from a feeling of propriety, and that his farm
        was in a flourishing condition. If it had been unsuccessful he would not
        have bought land at thirty-five roubles the acre, he would not have
        married his three sons and a nephew, he would not have rebuilt twice
        after fires, and each time on a larger scale. In spite of the old
        man&rsquo;s complaints, it was evident that he was proud, and justly
        proud, of his prosperity, proud of his sons, his nephew, his sons&rsquo;
        wives, his horses and his cows, and especially of the fact that he was
        keeping all this farming going. From his conversation with the old man,
        Levin thought he was not averse to new methods either. He had planted a
        great many potatoes, and his potatoes, as Levin had seen driving past,
        were already past flowering and beginning to die down, while
        Levin&rsquo;s were only just coming into flower. He earthed up his
        potatoes with a modern plough borrowed from a neighboring landowner. He
        sowed wheat. The trifling fact that, thinning out his rye, the old man
        used the rye he thinned out for his horses, specially struck Levin. How
        many times had Levin seen this splendid fodder wasted, and tried to get
        it saved; but always it had turned out to be impossible. The peasant got
        this done, and he could not say enough in praise of it as food for the
        beasts.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What have the wenches to do? They carry it out in bundles to the
        roadside, and the cart brings it away.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, we landowners can&rsquo;t manage well with our
        laborers,&rdquo; said Levin, handing him a glass of tea.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the old man, and he took the glass, but
        refused sugar, pointing to a lump he had left. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
        simple destruction,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Look at Sviazhsky&rsquo;s,
        for instance. We know what the land&rsquo;s like&mdash;first-rate, yet
        there&rsquo;s not much of a crop to boast of. It&rsquo;s not looked
        after enough&mdash;that&rsquo;s all it is!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you work your land with hired laborers?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all peasants together. We go into everything
        ourselves. If a man&rsquo;s no use, he can go, and we can manage by
        ourselves.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Father, Finogen wants some tar,&rdquo; said the young woman in
        the clogs, coming in.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, that&rsquo;s how it is, sir!&rdquo; said the old man,
        getting up, and crossing himself deliberately, he thanked Levin and went
        out.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Levin went into the kitchen to call his coachman he saw the whole
        family at dinner. The women were standing up waiting on them. The young,
        sturdy-looking son was telling something funny with his mouth full of
        pudding, and they were all laughing, the woman in the clogs, who was
        pouring cabbage soup into a bowl, laughing most merrily of all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Very probably the good-looking face of the young woman in the clogs had
        a good deal to do with the impression of well-being this peasant
        household made upon Levin, but the impression was so strong that Levin
        could never get rid of it. And all the way from the old peasant&rsquo;s
        to Sviazhsky&rsquo;s he kept recalling this peasant farm as though there
        were something in this impression that demanded his special attention.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 26</h3>

      <p>
        Sviazhsky was the marshal of his district. He was five years older than
        Levin, and had long been married. His sister-in-law, a young girl Levin
        liked very much, lived in his house; and Levin knew that Sviazhsky and
        his wife would have greatly liked to marry the girl to him. He knew this
        with certainty, as so-called eligible young men always know it, though
        he could never have brought himself to speak of it to anyone; and he
        knew too that, although he wanted to get married, and although by every
        token this very attractive girl would make an excellent wife, he could
        no more have married her, even if he had not been in love with Kitty
        Shtcherbatskaya, than he could have flown up to the sky. And this
        knowledge poisoned the pleasure he had hoped to find in the visit to
        Sviazhsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        On getting Sviazhsky&rsquo;s letter with the invitation for shooting,
        Levin had immediately thought of this; but in spite of it he had made up
        his mind that Sviazhsky&rsquo;s having such views for him was simply his
        own groundless supposition, and so he would go, all the same. Besides,
        at the bottom of his heart he had a desire to try himself, put himself
        to the test in regard to this girl. The Sviazhskys&rsquo; home-life was
        exceedingly pleasant, and Sviazhsky himself, the best type of man taking
        part in local affairs that Levin knew, was very interesting to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sviazhsky was one of those people, always a source of wonder to Levin,
        whose convictions, very logical though never original, go one way by
        themselves, while their life, exceedingly definite and firm in its
        direction, goes its way quite apart and almost always in direct
        contradiction to their convictions. Sviazhsky was an extremely advanced
        man. He despised the nobility, and believed the mass of the nobility to
        be secretly in favor of serfdom, and only concealing their views from
        cowardice. He regarded Russia as a ruined country, rather after the
        style of Turkey, and the government of Russia as so bad that he never
        permitted himself to criticize its doings seriously, and yet he was a
        functionary of that government and a model marshal of nobility, and when
        he drove about he always wore the cockade of office and the cap with the
        red band. He considered human life only tolerable abroad, and went
        abroad to stay at every opportunity, and at the same time he carried on
        a complex and improved system of agriculture in Russia, and with extreme
        interest followed everything and knew everything that was being done in
        Russia. He considered the Russian peasant as occupying a stage of
        development intermediate between the ape and the man, and at the same
        time in the local assemblies no one was readier to shake hands with the
        peasants and listen to their opinion. He believed neither in God nor the
        devil, but was much concerned about the question of the improvement of
        the clergy and the maintenance of their revenues, and took special
        trouble to keep up the church in his village.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the woman question he was on the side of the extreme advocates of
        complete liberty for women, and especially their right to labor. But he
        lived with his wife on such terms that their affectionate childless home
        life was the admiration of everyone, and arranged his wife&rsquo;s life
        so that she did nothing and could do nothing but share her
        husband&rsquo;s efforts that her time should pass as happily and as
        agreeably as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        If it had not been a characteristic of Levin&rsquo;s to put the most
        favorable interpretation on people, Sviazhsky&rsquo;s character would
        have presented no doubt or difficulty to him: he would have said to
        himself, &ldquo;a fool or a knave,&rdquo; and everything would have
        seemed clear. But he could not say &ldquo;a fool,&rdquo; because
        Sviazhsky was unmistakably clever, and moreover, a highly cultivated
        man, who was exceptionally modest over his culture. There was not a
        subject he knew nothing of. But he did not display his knowledge except
        when he was compelled to do so. Still less could Levin say that he was a
        knave, as Sviazhsky was unmistakably an honest, good-hearted, sensible
        man, who worked good-humoredly, keenly, and perseveringly at his work;
        he was held in high honor by everyone about him, and certainly he had
        never consciously done, and was indeed incapable of doing, anything
        base.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin tried to understand him, and could not understand him, and looked
        at him and his life as at a living enigma.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin and he were very friendly, and so Levin used to venture to sound
        Sviazhsky, to try to get at the very foundation of his view of life; but
        it was always in vain. Every time Levin tried to penetrate beyond the
        outer chambers of Sviazhsky&rsquo;s mind, which were hospitably open to
        all, he noticed that Sviazhsky was slightly disconcerted; faint signs of
        alarm were visible in his eyes, as though he were afraid Levin would
        understand him, and he would give him a kindly, good-humored repulse.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just now, since his disenchantment with farming, Levin was particularly
        glad to stay with Sviazhsky. Apart from the fact that the sight of this
        happy and affectionate couple, so pleased with themselves and everyone
        else, and their well-ordered home had always a cheering effect on Levin,
        he felt a longing, now that he was so dissatisfied with his own life, to
        get at that secret in Sviazhsky that gave him such clearness,
        definiteness, and good courage in life. Moreover, Levin knew that at
        Sviazhsky&rsquo;s he should meet the landowners of the neighborhood, and
        it was particularly interesting for him just now to hear and take part
        in those rural conversations concerning crops, laborers&rsquo; wages,
        and so on, which, he was aware, are conventionally regarded as something
        very low, but which seemed to him just now to constitute the one subject
        of importance. &ldquo;It was not, perhaps, of importance in the days of
        serfdom, and it may not be of importance in England. In both cases the
        conditions of agriculture are firmly established; but among us now, when
        everything has been turned upside down and is only just taking shape,
        the question what form these conditions will take is the one question of
        importance in Russia,&rdquo; thought Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        The shooting turned out to be worse than Levin had expected. The marsh
        was dry and there were no grouse at all. He walked about the whole day
        and only brought back three birds, but to make up for that&mdash;he
        brought back, as he always did from shooting, an excellent appetite,
        excellent spirits, and that keen, intellectual mood which with him
        always accompanied violent physical exertion. And while out shooting,
        when he seemed to be thinking of nothing at all, suddenly the old man
        and his family kept coming back to his mind, and the impression of them
        seemed to claim not merely his attention, but the solution of some
        question connected with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the evening at tea, two landowners who had come about some business
        connected with a wardship were of the party, and the interesting
        conversation Levin had been looking forward to sprang up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin was sitting beside his hostess at the tea table, and was obliged
        to keep up a conversation with her and her sister, who was sitting
        opposite him. Madame Sviazhskaya was a round-faced, fair-haired, rather
        short woman, all smiles and dimples. Levin tried through her to get a
        solution of the weighty enigma her husband presented to his mind; but he
        had not complete freedom of ideas, because he was in an agony of
        embarrassment. This agony of embarrassment was due to the fact that the
        sister-in-law was sitting opposite to him, in a dress, specially put on,
        as he fancied, for his benefit, cut particularly open, in the shape of a
        trapeze, on her white bosom. This quadrangular opening, in spite of the
        bosom&rsquo;s being very white, or just because it was very white,
        deprived Levin of the full use of his faculties. He imagined, probably
        mistakenly, that this low-necked bodice had been made on his account,
        and felt that he had no right to look at it, and tried not to look at
        it; but he felt that he was to blame for the very fact of the low-necked
        bodice having been made. It seemed to Levin that he had deceived
        someone, that he ought to explain something, but that to explain it was
        impossible, and for that reason he was continually blushing, was ill at
        ease and awkward. His awkwardness infected the pretty sister-in-law too.
        But their hostess appeared not to observe this, and kept purposely
        drawing her into the conversation.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You say,&rdquo; she said, pursuing the subject that had been
        started, &ldquo;that my husband cannot be interested in what&rsquo;s
        Russian. It&rsquo;s quite the contrary; he is always in cheerful spirits
        abroad, but not as he is here. Here, he feels in his proper place. He
        has so much to do, and he has the faculty of interesting himself in
        everything. Oh, you&rsquo;ve not been to see our school, have
        you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it.... The little house covered with ivy,
        isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s Nastia&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; she said,
        indicating her sister.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You teach in it yourself?&rdquo; asked Levin, trying to look
        above the open neck, but feeling that wherever he looked in that
        direction he should see it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; I used to teach in it myself, and do teach still, but we
        have a first-rate schoolmistress now. And we&rsquo;ve started gymnastic
        exercises.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, thank you, I won&rsquo;t have any more tea,&rdquo; said
        Levin, and conscious of doing a rude thing, but incapable of continuing
        the conversation, he got up, blushing. &ldquo;I hear a very interesting
        conversation,&rdquo; he added, and walked to the other end of the table,
        where Sviazhsky was sitting with the two gentlemen of the neighborhood.
        Sviazhsky was sitting sideways, with one elbow on the table, and a cup
        in one hand, while with the other hand he gathered up his beard, held it
        to his nose and let it drop again, as though he were smelling it. His
        brilliant black eyes were looking straight at the excited country
        gentleman with gray whiskers, and apparently he derived amusement from
        his remarks. The gentleman was complaining of the peasants. It was
        evident to Levin that Sviazhsky knew an answer to this gentleman&rsquo;s
        complaints, which would at once demolish his whole contention, but that
        in his position he could not give utterance to this answer, and
        listened, not without pleasure, to the landowner&rsquo;s comic speeches.
      </p>

      <p>
        The gentleman with the gray whiskers was obviously an inveterate
        adherent of serfdom and a devoted agriculturist, who had lived all his
        life in the country. Levin saw proofs of this in his dress, in the
        old-fashioned threadbare coat, obviously not his everyday attire, in his
        shrewd, deep-set eyes, in his idiomatic, fluent Russian, in the
        imperious tone that had become habitual from long use, and in the
        resolute gestures of his large, red, sunburnt hands, with an old
        betrothal ring on the little finger.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 27</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d only the heart to throw up what&rsquo;s been set
        going ... such a lot of trouble wasted ... I&rsquo;d turn my back on the
        whole business, sell up, go off like Nikolay Ivanovitch ... to hear
        <i>La Belle Hélène</i>,&rdquo; said the landowner, a pleasant smile
        lighting up his shrewd old face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you see you don&rsquo;t throw it up,&rdquo; said Nikolay
        Ivanovitch Sviazhsky; &ldquo;so there must be something gained.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The only gain is that I live in my own house, neither bought nor
        hired. Besides, one keeps hoping the people will learn sense. Though,
        instead of that, you&rsquo;d never believe it&mdash;the drunkenness, the
        immorality! They keep chopping and changing their bits of land. Not a
        sight of a horse or a cow. The peasant&rsquo;s dying of hunger, but just
        go and take him on as a laborer, he&rsquo;ll do his best to do you a
        mischief, and then bring you up before the justice of the peace.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But then you make complaints to the justice too,&rdquo; said
        Sviazhsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I lodge complaints? Not for anything in the world! Such a
        talking, and such a to-do, that one would have cause to regret it. At
        the works, for instance, they pocketed the advance-money and made off.
        What did the justice do? Why, acquitted them. Nothing keeps them in
        order but their own communal court and their village elder. He&rsquo;ll
        flog them in the good old style! But for that there&rsquo;d be nothing
        for it but to give it all up and run away.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Obviously the landowner was chaffing Sviazhsky, who, far from resenting
        it, was apparently amused by it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you see we manage our land without such extreme
        measures,&rdquo; said he, smiling: &ldquo;Levin and I and this
        gentleman.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He indicated the other landowner.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, the thing&rsquo;s done at Mihail Petrovitch&rsquo;s, but ask
        him how it&rsquo;s done. Do you call that a rational system?&rdquo; said
        the landowner, obviously rather proud of the word
        &ldquo;rational.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My system&rsquo;s very simple,&rdquo; said Mihail Petrovitch,
        &ldquo;thank God. All my management rests on getting the money ready for
        the autumn taxes, and the peasants come to me, &lsquo;Father, master,
        help us!&rsquo; Well, the peasants are all one&rsquo;s neighbors; one
        feels for them. So one advances them a third, but one says:
        &lsquo;Remember, lads, I have helped you, and you must help me when I
        need it&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s the sowing of the oats, or the
        haycutting, or the harvest&rsquo;; and well, one agrees, so much for
        each taxpayer&mdash;though there are dishonest ones among them too,
        it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin, who had long been familiar with these patriarchal methods,
        exchanged glances with Sviazhsky and interrupted Mihail Petrovitch,
        turning again to the gentleman with the gray whiskers.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then what do you think?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;what system is
        one to adopt nowadays?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, manage like Mihail Petrovitch, or let the land for half the
        crop or for rent to the peasants; that one can do&mdash;only
        that&rsquo;s just how the general prosperity of the country is being
        ruined. Where the land with serf-labor and good management gave a yield
        of nine to one, on the half-crop system it yields three to one. Russia
        has been ruined by the emancipation!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Sviazhsky looked with smiling eyes at Levin, and even made a faint
        gesture of irony to him; but Levin did not think the landowner&rsquo;s
        words absurd, he understood them better than he did Sviazhsky. A great
        deal more of what the gentleman with the gray whiskers said to show in
        what way Russia was ruined by the emancipation struck him indeed as very
        true, new to him, and quite incontestable. The landowner unmistakably
        spoke his own individual thought&mdash;a thing that very rarely
        happens&mdash;and a thought to which he had been brought not by a desire
        of finding some exercise for an idle brain, but a thought which had
        grown up out of the conditions of his life, which he had brooded over in
        the solitude of his village, and had considered in every aspect.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The point is, don&rsquo;t you see, that progress of every sort is
        only made by the use of authority,&rdquo; he said, evidently wishing to
        show he was not without culture. &ldquo;Take the reforms of Peter, of
        Catherine, of Alexander. Take European history. And progress in
        agriculture more than anything else&mdash;the potato, for instance, that
        was introduced among us by force. The wooden plough too wasn&rsquo;t
        always used. It was introduced maybe in the days before the Empire, but
        it was probably brought in by force. Now, in our own day, we landowners
        in the serf times used various improvements in our husbandry: drying
        machines and thrashing machines, and carting manure and all the modern
        implements&mdash;all that we brought into use by our authority, and the
        peasants opposed it at first, and ended by imitating us. Now, by the
        abolition of serfdom we have been deprived of our authority; and so our
        husbandry, where it had been raised to a high level, is bound to sink to
        the most savage primitive condition. That&rsquo;s how I see it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But why so? If it&rsquo;s rational, you&rsquo;ll be able to keep
        up the same system with hired labor,&rdquo; said Sviazhsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no power over them. With whom am I going to work the
        system, allow me to ask?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There it is&mdash;the labor force&mdash;the chief element in
        agriculture,&rdquo; thought Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;With laborers.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The laborers won&rsquo;t work well, and won&rsquo;t work with
        good implements. Our laborer can do nothing but get drunk like a pig,
        and when he&rsquo;s drunk he ruins everything you give him. He makes the
        horses ill with too much water, cuts good harness, barters the tires of
        the wheels for drink, drops bits of iron into the thrashing machine, so
        as to break it. He loathes the sight of anything that&rsquo;s not after
        his fashion. And that&rsquo;s how it is the whole level of husbandry has
        fallen. Lands gone out of cultivation, overgrown with weeds, or divided
        among the peasants, and where millions of bushels were raised you get a
        hundred thousand; the wealth of the country has decreased. If the same
        thing had been done, but with care that....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he proceeded to unfold his own scheme of emancipation by means of
        which these drawbacks might have been avoided.
      </p>

      <p>
        This did not interest Levin, but when he had finished, Levin went back
        to his first position, and, addressing Sviazhsky, and trying to draw him
        into expressing his serious opinion:&mdash;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That the standard of culture is falling, and that with our
        present relations to the peasants there is no possibility of farming on
        a rational system to yield a profit&mdash;that&rsquo;s perfectly
        true,&rdquo; said he.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; Sviazhsky replied quite
        seriously; &ldquo;all I see is that we don&rsquo;t know how to cultivate
        the land, and that our system of agriculture in the serf days was by no
        means too high, but too low. We have no machines, no good stock, no
        efficient supervision; we don&rsquo;t even know how to keep accounts.
        Ask any landowner; he won&rsquo;t be able to tell you what crop&rsquo;s
        profitable, and what&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Italian bookkeeping,&rdquo; said the gentleman of the gray
        whiskers ironically. &ldquo;You may keep your books as you like, but if
        they spoil everything for you, there won&rsquo;t be any profit.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why do they spoil things? A poor thrashing machine, or your
        Russian presser, they will break, but my steam press they don&rsquo;t
        break. A wretched Russian nag they&rsquo;ll ruin, but keep good
        dray-horses&mdash;they won&rsquo;t ruin them. And so it is all round. We
        must raise our farming to a higher level.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, if one only had the means to do it, Nikolay Ivanovitch!
        It&rsquo;s all very well for you; but for me, with a son to keep at the
        university, lads to be educated at the high school&mdash;how am I going
        to buy these dray-horses?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what the land banks are for.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To get what&rsquo;s left me sold by auction? No, thank
        you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree that it&rsquo;s necessary or possible to
        raise the level of agriculture still higher,&rdquo; said Levin. &ldquo;I
        devote myself to it, and I have means, but I can do nothing. As to the
        banks, I don&rsquo;t know to whom they&rsquo;re any good. For my part,
        anyway, whatever I&rsquo;ve spent money on in the way of husbandry, it
        has been a loss: stock&mdash;a loss, machinery&mdash;a loss.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; the gentleman with the gray
        whiskers chimed in, positively laughing with satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not the only one,&rdquo; pursued Levin. &ldquo;I
        mix with all the neighboring landowners, who are cultivating their land
        on a rational system; they all, with rare exceptions, are doing so at a
        loss. Come, tell us how does your land do&mdash;does it pay?&rdquo; said
        Levin, and at once in Sviazhsky&rsquo;s eyes he detected that fleeting
        expression of alarm which he had noticed whenever he had tried to
        penetrate beyond the outer chambers of Sviazhsky&rsquo;s mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, this question on Levin&rsquo;s part was not quite in good
        faith. Madame Sviazhskaya had just told him at tea that they had that
        summer invited a German expert in bookkeeping from Moscow, who for a
        consideration of five hundred roubles had investigated the management of
        their property, and found that it was costing them a loss of three
        thousand odd roubles. She did not remember the precise sum, but it
        appeared that the German had worked it out to the fraction of a
        farthing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The gray-whiskered landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of
        Sviazhsky&rsquo;s famling, obviously aware how much gain his neighbor
        and marshal was likely to be making.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Possibly it does not pay,&rdquo; answered Sviazhsky. &ldquo;That
        merely proves either that I&rsquo;m a bad manager, or that I&rsquo;ve
        sunk my capital for the increase of my rents.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, rent!&rdquo; Levin cried with horror. &ldquo;Rent there may
        be in Europe, where land has been improved by the labor put into it, but
        with us all the land is deteriorating from the labor put into
        it&mdash;in other words they&rsquo;re working it out; so there&rsquo;s
        no question of rent.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How no rent? It&rsquo;s a law.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re outside the law; rent explains nothing for us,
        but simply muddles us. No, tell me how there can be a theory of
        rent?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you have some junket? Masha, pass us some junket or
        raspberries.&rdquo; He turned to his wife. &ldquo;Extraordinarily late
        the raspberries are lasting this year.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And in the happiest frame of mind Sviazhsky got up and walked off,
        apparently supposing the conversation to have ended at the very point
        when to Levin it seemed that it was only just beginning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having lost his antagonist, Levin continued the conversation with the
        gray-whiskered landowner, trying to prove to him that all the difficulty
        arises from the fact that we don&rsquo;t find out the peculiarities and
        habits of our laborer; but the landowner, like all men who think
        independently and in isolation, was slow in taking in any other
        person&rsquo;s idea, and particularly partial to his own. He stuck to it
        that the Russian peasant is a swine and likes swinishness, and that to
        get him out of his swinishness one must have authority, and there is
        none; one must have the stick, and we have become so liberal that we
        have all of a sudden replaced the stick that served us for a thousand
        years by lawyers and model prisons, where the worthless, stinking
        peasant is fed on good soup and has a fixed allowance of cubic feet of
        air.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What makes you think,&rdquo; said Levin, trying to get back to
        the question, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s impossible to find some relation to
        the laborer in which the labor would become productive?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That never could be so with the Russian peasantry; we&rsquo;ve no
        power over them,&rdquo; answered the landowner.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How can new conditions be found?&rdquo; said Sviazhsky. Having
        eaten some junket and lighted a cigarette, he came back to the
        discussion. &ldquo;All possible relations to the labor force have been
        defined and studied,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The relic of barbarism, the
        primitive commune with each guarantee for all, will disappear of itself;
        serfdom has been abolished&mdash;there remains nothing but free labor,
        and its forms are fixed and ready made, and must be adopted. Permanent
        hands, day-laborers, rammers&mdash;you can&rsquo;t get out of those
        forms.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But Europe is dissatisfied with these forms.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dissatisfied, and seeking new ones. And will find them, in all
        probability.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I was meaning,&rdquo; answered Levin.
        &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we seek them for ourselves?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for
        constructing railways. They are ready, invented.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But if they don&rsquo;t do for us, if they&rsquo;re
        stupid?&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        And again he detected the expression of alarm in the eyes of Sviazhsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes; we&rsquo;ll bury the world under our caps! We&rsquo;ve
        found the secret Europe was seeking for! I&rsquo;ve heard all that; but,
        excuse me, do you know all that&rsquo;s been done in Europe on the
        question of the organization of labor?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, very little.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That question is now absorbing the best minds in Europe. The
        Schulze-Delitsch movement.... And then all this enormous literature of
        the labor question, the most liberal Lassalle movement ... the Mulhausen
        experiment? That&rsquo;s a fact by now, as you&rsquo;re probably
        aware.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have some idea of it, but very vague.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, you only say that; no doubt you know all about it as well as
        I do. I&rsquo;m not a professor of sociology, of course, but it
        interested me, and really, if it interests you, you ought to study
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what conclusion have they come to?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The two neighbors had risen, and Sviazhsky, once more checking Levin in
        his inconvenient habit of peeping into what was beyond the outer
        chambers of his mind, went to see his guests out.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 28</h3>

      <p>
        Levin was insufferably bored that evening with the ladies; he was
        stirred as he had never been before by the idea that the dissatisfaction
        he was feeling with his system of managing his land was not an
        exceptional case, but the general condition of things in Russia; that
        the organization of some relation of the laborers to the soil in which
        they would work, as with the peasant he had met half-way to the
        Sviazhskys&rsquo;, was not a dream, but a problem which must be solved.
        And it seemed to him that the problem could be solved, and that he ought
        to try and solve it.
      </p>

      <p>
        After saying good-night to the ladies, and promising to stay the whole
        of the next day, so as to make an expedition on horseback with them to
        see an interesting ruin in the crown forest, Levin went, before going to
        bed, into his host&rsquo;s study to get the books on the labor question
        that Sviazhsky had offered him. Sviazhsky&rsquo;s study was a huge room,
        surrounded by bookcases and with two tables in it&mdash;one a massive
        writing-table, standing in the middle of the room, and the other a round
        table, covered with recent numbers of reviews and journals in different
        languages, ranged like the rays of a star round the lamp. On the
        writing-table was a stand of drawers marked with gold lettering, and
        full of papers of various sorts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sviazhsky took out the books, and sat down in a rocking-chair.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What are you looking at there?&rdquo; he said to Levin, who was
        standing at the round table looking through the reviews.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, there&rsquo;s a very interesting article here,&rdquo;
        said Sviazhsky of the review Levin was holding in his hand. &ldquo;It
        appears,&rdquo; he went on, with eager interest, &ldquo;that Friedrich
        was not, after all, the person chiefly responsible for the partition of
        Poland. It is proved....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And with his characteristic clearness, he summed up those new, very
        important, and interesting revelations. Although Levin was engrossed at
        the moment by his ideas about the problem of the land, he wondered, as
        he heard Sviazhsky: &ldquo;What is there inside of him? And why, why is
        he interested in the partition of Poland?&rdquo; When Sviazhsky had
        finished, Levin could not help asking: &ldquo;Well, and what
        then?&rdquo; But there was nothing to follow. It was simply interesting
        that it had been proved to be so and so. But Sviazhsky did not explain,
        and saw no need to explain why it was interesting to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but I was very much interested by your irritable
        neighbor,&rdquo; said Levin, sighing. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a clever fellow,
        and said a lot that was true.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, get along with you! An inveterate supporter of serfdom at
        heart, like all of them!&rdquo; said Sviazhsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Whose marshal you are.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, only I marshal them in the other direction,&rdquo; said
        Sviazhsky, laughing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what interests me very much,&rdquo; said
        Levin. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s right that our system, that&rsquo;s to say of
        rational farming, doesn&rsquo;t answer, that the only thing that answers
        is the money-lender system, like that meek-looking gentleman&rsquo;s, or
        else the very simplest.... Whose fault is it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Our own, of course. Besides, it&rsquo;s not true that it
        doesn&rsquo;t answer. It answers with Vassiltchikov.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A factory....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I really don&rsquo;t know what it is you are surprised at.
        The people are at such a low stage of rational and moral development,
        that it&rsquo;s obvious they&rsquo;re bound to oppose everything
        that&rsquo;s strange to them. In Europe, a rational system answers
        because the people are educated; it follows that we must educate the
        people&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But how are we to educate the people?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To educate the people three things are needed: schools, and
        schools, and schools.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you said yourself the people are at such a low stage of
        material development: what help are schools for that?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know, you remind me of the story of the advice given to
        the sick man&mdash;You should try purgative medicine. Taken: worse. Try
        leeches. Tried them: worse. Well, then, there&rsquo;s nothing left but
        to pray to God. Tried it: worse. That&rsquo;s just how it is with us. I
        say political economy; you say&mdash;worse. I say socialism: worse.
        Education: worse.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But how do schools help matters?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They give the peasant fresh wants.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a thing I&rsquo;ve never understood,&rdquo;
        Levin replied with heat. &ldquo;In what way are schools going to help
        the people to improve their material position? You say schools,
        education, will give them fresh wants. So much the worse, since they
        won&rsquo;t be capable of satisfying them. And in what way a knowledge
        of addition and subtraction and the catechism is going to improve their
        material condition, I never could make out. The day before yesterday, I
        met a peasant woman in the evening with a little baby, and asked her
        where she was going. She said she was going to the wise woman; her boy
        had screaming fits, so she was taking him to be doctored. I asked,
        &lsquo;Why, how does the wise woman cure screaming fits?&rsquo;
        &lsquo;She puts the child on the hen-roost and repeats some
        charm....&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re saying it yourself! What&rsquo;s wanted to
        prevent her taking her child to the hen-roost to cure it of screaming
        fits is just....&rdquo; Sviazhsky said, smiling good-humoredly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Levin with annoyance; &ldquo;that method of
        doctoring I merely meant as a simile for doctoring the people with
        schools. The people are poor and ignorant&mdash;that we see as surely as
        the peasant woman sees the baby is ill because it screams. But in what
        way this trouble of poverty and ignorance is to be cured by schools is
        as incomprehensible as how the hen-roost affects the screaming. What has
        to be cured is what makes him poor.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, in that, at least, you&rsquo;re in agreement with Spencer,
        whom you dislike so much. He says, too, that education may be the
        consequence of greater prosperity and comfort, of more frequent washing,
        as he says, but not of being able to read and write....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;m very glad&mdash;or the contrary, very
        sorry, that I&rsquo;m in agreement with Spencer; only I&rsquo;ve known
        it a long while. Schools can do no good; what will do good is an
        economic organization in which the people will become richer, will have
        more leisure&mdash;and then there will be schools.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Still, all over Europe now schools are obligatory.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And how far do you agree with Spencer yourself about it?&rdquo;
        asked Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        But there was a gleam of alarm in Sviazhsky&rsquo;s eyes, and he said
        smiling:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; that screaming story is positively capital! Did you really
        hear it yourself?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin saw that he was not to discover the connection between this
        man&rsquo;s life and his thoughts. Obviously he did not care in the
        least what his reasoning led him to; all he wanted was the process of
        reasoning. And he did not like it when the process of reasoning brought
        him into a blind alley. That was the only thing he disliked, and avoided
        by changing the conversation to something agreeable and amusing.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the impressions of the day, beginning with the impression made by
        the old peasant, which served, as it were, as the fundamental basis of
        all the conceptions and ideas of the day, threw Levin into violent
        excitement. This dear good Sviazhsky, keeping a stock of ideas simply
        for social purposes, and obviously having some other principles hidden
        from Levin, while with the crowd, whose name is legion, he guided public
        opinion by ideas he did not share; that irascible country gentleman,
        perfectly correct in the conclusions that he had been worried into by
        life, but wrong in his exasperation against a whole class, and that the
        best class in Russia; his own dissatisfaction with the work he had been
        doing, and the vague hope of finding a remedy for all this&mdash;all was
        blended in a sense of inward turmoil, and anticipation of some solution
        near at hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Left alone in the room assigned him, lying on a spring mattress that
        yielded unexpectedly at every movement of his arm or his leg, Levin did
        not fall asleep for a long while. Not one conversation with Sviazhsky,
        though he had said a great deal that was clever, had interested Levin;
        but the conclusions of the irascible landowner required consideration.
        Levin could not help recalling every word he had said, and in
        imagination amending his own replies.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I ought to have said to him: You say that our husbandry does
        not answer because the peasant hates improvements, and that they must be
        forced on him by authority. If no system of husbandry answered at all
        without these improvements, you would be quite right. But the only
        system that does answer is where laborer is working in accordance with
        his habits, just as on the old peasant&rsquo;s land half-way here. Your
        and our general dissatisfaction with the system shows that either we are
        to blame or the laborers. We have gone our way&mdash;the European
        way&mdash;a long while, without asking ourselves about the qualities of
        our labor force. Let us try to look upon the labor force not as an
        abstract force, but as the <i>Russian peasant</i> with his instincts,
        and we shall arrange our system of culture in accordance with that.
        Imagine, I ought to have said to him, that you have the same system as
        the old peasant has, that you have found means of making your laborers
        take an interest in the success of the work, and have found the happy
        mean in the way of improvements which they will admit, and you will,
        without exhausting the soil, get twice or three times the yield you got
        before. Divide it in halves, give half as the share of labor, the
        surplus left you will be greater, and the share of labor will be greater
        too. And to do this one must lower the standard of husbandry and
        interest the laborers in its success. How to do this?&mdash;that&rsquo;s
        a matter of detail; but undoubtedly it can be done.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This idea threw Levin into a great excitement. He did not sleep half the
        night, thinking over in detail the putting of his idea into practice. He
        had not intended to go away next day, but he now determined to go home
        early in the morning. Besides, the sister-in-law with her low-necked
        bodice aroused in him a feeling akin to shame and remorse for some
        utterly base action. Most important of all&mdash;he must get back
        without delay: he would have to make haste to put his new project to the
        peasants before the sowing of the winter wheat, so that the sowing might
        be undertaken on a new basis. He had made up his mind to revolutionize
        his whole system.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 29</h3>

      <p>
        The carrying out of Levin&rsquo;s plan presented many difficulties; but
        he struggled on, doing his utmost, and attained a result which, though
        not what he desired, was enough to enable him, without self-deception,
        to believe that the attempt was worth the trouble. One of the chief
        difficulties was that the process of cultivating the land was in full
        swing, that it was impossible to stop everything and begin it all again
        from the beginning, and the machine had to be mended while in motion.
      </p>

      <p>
        When on the evening that he arrived home he informed the bailiff of his
        plans, the latter with visible pleasure agreed with what he said so long
        as he was pointing out that all that had been done up to that time was
        stupid and useless. The bailiff said that he had said so a long while
        ago, but no heed had been paid him. But as for the proposal made by
        Levin&mdash;to take a part as shareholder with his laborers in each
        agricultural undertaking&mdash;at this the bailiff simply expressed a
        profound despondency, and offered no definite opinion, but began
        immediately talking of the urgent necessity of carrying the remaining
        sheaves of rye the next day, and of sending the men out for the second
        ploughing, so that Levin felt that this was not the time for discussing
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        On beginning to talk to the peasants about it, and making a proposition
        to cede them the land on new terms, he came into collision with the same
        great difficulty that they were so much absorbed by the current work of
        the day, that they had not time to consider the advantages and
        disadvantages of the proposed scheme.
      </p>

      <p>
        The simple-hearted Ivan, the cowherd, seemed completely to grasp
        Levin&rsquo;s proposal&mdash;that he should with his family take a share
        of the profits of the cattle-yard&mdash;and he was in complete sympathy
        with the plan. But when Levin hinted at the future advantages,
        Ivan&rsquo;s face expressed alarm and regret that he could not hear all
        he had to say, and he made haste to find himself some task that would
        admit of no delay: he either snatched up the fork to pitch the hay out
        of the pens, or ran to get water or to clear out the dung.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another difficulty lay in the invincible disbelief of the peasant that a
        landowner&rsquo;s object could be anything else than a desire to squeeze
        all he could out of them. They were firmly convinced that his real aim
        (whatever he might say to them) would always be in what he did not say
        to them. And they themselves, in giving their opinion, said a great deal
        but never said what was their real object. Moreover (Levin felt that the
        irascible landowner had been right) the peasants made their first and
        unalterable condition of any agreement whatever that they should not be
        forced to any new methods of tillage of any kind, nor to use new
        implements. They agreed that the modern plough ploughed better, that the
        scarifier did the work more quickly, but they found thousands of reasons
        that made it out of the question for them to use either of them; and
        though he had accepted the conviction that he would have to lower the
        standard of cultivation, he felt sorry to give up improved methods, the
        advantages of which were so obvious. But in spite of all these
        difficulties he got his way, and by autumn the system was working, or at
        least so it seemed to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first Levin had thought of giving up the whole farming of the land
        just as it was to the peasants, the laborers, and the bailiff on new
        conditions of partnership; but he was very soon convinced that this was
        impossible, and determined to divide it up. The cattle-yard, the garden,
        hay fields, and arable land, divided into several parts, had to be made
        into separate lots. The simple-hearted cowherd, Ivan, who, Levin
        fancied, understood the matter better than any of them, collecting
        together a gang of workers to help him, principally of his own family,
        became a partner in the cattle-yard. A distant part of the estate, a
        tract of waste land that had lain fallow for eight years, was with the
        help of the clever carpenter, Fyodor Ryezunov, taken by six families of
        peasants on new conditions of partnership, and the peasant Shuraev took
        the management of all the vegetable gardens on the same terms. The
        remainder of the land was still worked on the old system, but these
        three associated partnerships were the first step to a new organization
        of the whole, and they completely took up Levin&rsquo;s time.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is true that in the cattle-yard things went no better than before,
        and Ivan strenuously opposed warm housing for the cows and butter made
        of fresh cream, affirming that cows require less food if kept cold, and
        that butter is more profitable made from sour cream, and he asked for
        wages just as under the old system, and took not the slightest interest
        in the fact that the money he received was not wages but an advance out
        of his future share in the profits.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is true that Fyodor Ryezunov&rsquo;s company did not plough over the
        ground twice before sowing, as had been agreed, justifying themselves on
        the plea that the time was too short. It is true that the peasants of
        the same company, though they had agreed to work the land on new
        conditions, always spoke of the land, not as held in partnership, but as
        rented for half the crop, and more than once the peasants and Ryezunov
        himself said to Levin, &ldquo;If you would take a rent for the land, it
        would save you trouble, and we should be more free.&rdquo; Moreover the
        same peasants kept putting off, on various excuses, the building of a
        cattleyard and barn on the land as agreed upon, and delayed doing it
        till the winter.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is true that Shuraev would have liked to let out the kitchen gardens
        he had undertaken in small lots to the peasants. He evidently quite
        misunderstood, and apparently intentionally misunderstood, the
        conditions upon which the land had been given to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Often, too, talking to the peasants and explaining to them all the
        advantages of the plan, Levin felt that the peasants heard nothing but
        the sound of his voice, and were firmly resolved, whatever he might say,
        not to let themselves be taken in. He felt this especially when he
        talked to the cleverest of the peasants, Ryezunov, and detected the
        gleam in Ryezunov&rsquo;s eyes which showed so plainly both ironical
        amusement at Levin, and the firm conviction that, if anyone were to be
        taken in, it would not be he, Ryezunov. But in spite of all this Levin
        thought the system worked, and that by keeping accounts strictly and
        insisting on his own way, he would prove to them in the future the
        advantages of the arrangement, and then the system would go of itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        These matters, together with the management of the land still left on
        his hands, and the indoor work over his book, so engrossed Levin the
        whole summer that he scarcely ever went out shooting. At the end of
        August he heard that the Oblonskys had gone away to Moscow, from their
        servant who brought back the side-saddle. He felt that in not answering
        Darya Alexandrovna&rsquo;s letter he had by his rudeness, of which he
        could not think without a flush of shame, burned his ships, and that he
        would never go and see them again. He had been just as rude with the
        Sviazhskys, leaving them without saying good-bye. But he would never go
        to see them again either. He did not care about that now. The business
        of reorganizing the farming of his land absorbed him as completely as
        though there would never be anything else in his life. He read the books
        lent him by Sviazhsky, and copying out what he had not got, he read both
        the economic and socialistic books on the subject, but, as he had
        anticipated, found nothing bearing on the scheme he had undertaken. In
        the books on political economy&mdash;in Mill, for instance, whom he
        studied first with great ardor, hoping every minute to find an answer to
        the questions that were engrossing him&mdash;he found laws deduced from
        the condition of land culture in Europe; but he did not see why these
        laws, which did not apply in Russia, must be general. He saw just the
        same thing in the socialistic books: either they were the beautiful but
        impracticable fantasies which had fascinated him when he was a student,
        or they were attempts at improving, rectifying the economic position in
        which Europe was placed, with which the system of land tenure in Russia
        had nothing in common. Political economy told him that the laws by which
        the wealth of Europe had been developed, and was developing, were
        universal and unvarying. Socialism told him that development along these
        lines leads to ruin. And neither of them gave an answer, or even a hint,
        in reply to the question what he, Levin, and all the Russian peasants
        and landowners, were to do with their millions of hands and millions of
        acres, to make them as productive as possible for the common weal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having once taken the subject up, he read conscientiously everything
        bearing on it, and intended in the autumn to go abroad to study land
        systems on the spot, in order that he might not on this question be
        confronted with what so often met him on various subjects. Often, just
        as he was beginning to understand the idea in the mind of anyone he was
        talking to, and was beginning to explain his own, he would suddenly be
        told: &ldquo;But Kauffmann, but Jones, but Dubois, but Michelli? You
        haven&rsquo;t read them: they&rsquo;ve thrashed that question out
        thoroughly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He saw now distinctly that Kauffmann and Michelli had nothing to tell
        him. He knew what he wanted. He saw that Russia has splendid land,
        splendid laborers, and that in certain cases, as at the peasant&rsquo;s
        on the way to Sviazhsky&rsquo;s, the produce raised by the laborers and
        the land is great&mdash;in the majority of cases when capital is applied
        in the European way the produce is small, and that this simply arises
        from the fact that the laborers want to work and work well only in their
        own peculiar way, and that this antagonism is not incidental but
        invariable, and has its roots in the national spirit. He thought that
        the Russian people whose task it was to colonize and cultivate vast
        tracts of unoccupied land, consciously adhered, till all their land was
        occupied, to the methods suitable to their purpose, and that their
        methods were by no means so bad as was generally supposed. And he wanted
        to prove this theoretically in his book and practically on his land.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 30</h3>

      <p>
        At the end of September the timber had been carted for building the
        cattleyard on the land that had been allotted to the association of
        peasants, and the butter from the cows was sold and the profits divided.
        In practice the system worked capitally, or, at least, so it seemed to
        Levin. In order to work out the whole subject theoretically and to
        complete his book, which, in Levin&rsquo;s daydreams, was not merely to
        effect a revolution in political economy, but to annihilate that science
        entirely and to lay the foundation of a new science of the relation of
        the people to the soil, all that was left to do was to make a tour
        abroad, and to study on the spot all that had been done in the same
        direction, and to collect conclusive evidence that all that had been
        done there was not what was wanted. Levin was only waiting for the
        delivery of his wheat to receive the money for it and go abroad. But the
        rains began, preventing the harvesting of the corn and potatoes left in
        the fields, and putting a stop to all work, even to the delivery of the
        wheat.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mud was impassable along the roads; two mills were carried away, and
        the weather got worse and worse.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the 30th of September the sun came out in the morning, and hoping for
        fine weather, Levin began making final preparations for his journey. He
        gave orders for the wheat to be delivered, sent the bailiff to the
        merchant to get the money owing him, and went out himself to give some
        final directions on the estate before setting off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having finished all his business, soaked through with the streams of
        water which kept running down the leather behind his neck and his
        gaiters, but in the keenest and most confident temper, Levin returned
        homewards in the evening. The weather had become worse than ever towards
        evening; the hail lashed the drenched mare so cruelly that she went
        along sideways, shaking her head and ears; but Levin was all right under
        his hood, and he looked cheerfully about him at the muddy streams
        running under the wheels, at the drops hanging on every bare twig, at
        the whiteness of the patch of unmelted hailstones on the planks of the
        bridge, at the thick layer of still juicy, fleshy leaves that lay heaped
        up about the stripped elm-tree. In spite of the gloominess of nature
        around him, he felt peculiarly eager. The talks he had been having with
        the peasants in the further village had shown that they were beginning
        to get used to their new position. The old servant to whose hut he had
        gone to get dry evidently approved of Levin&rsquo;s plan, and of his own
        accord proposed to enter the partnership by the purchase of cattle.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have only to go stubbornly on towards my aim, and I shall
        attain my end,&rdquo; thought Levin; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s something to
        work and take trouble for. This is not a matter of myself individually;
        the question of the public welfare comes into it. The whole system of
        culture, the chief element in the condition of the people, must be
        completely transformed. Instead of poverty, general prosperity and
        content; instead of hostility, harmony and unity of interests. In short,
        a bloodless revolution, but a revolution of the greatest magnitude,
        beginning in the little circle of our district, then the province, then
        Russia, the whole world. Because a just idea cannot but be fruitful.
        Yes, it&rsquo;s an aim worth working for. And its being me, Kostya
        Levin, who went to a ball in a black tie, and was refused by the
        Shtcherbatskaya girl, and who was intrinsically such a pitiful,
        worthless creature&mdash;that proves nothing; I feel sure Franklin felt
        just as worthless, and he too had no faith in himself, thinking of
        himself as a whole. That means nothing. And he too, most likely, had an
        Agafea Mihalovna to whom he confided his secrets.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Musing on such thoughts Levin reached home in the darkness.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bailiff, who had been to the merchant, had come back and brought
        part of the money for the wheat. An agreement had been made with the old
        servant, and on the road the bailiff had learned that everywhere the
        corn was still standing in the fields, so that his one hundred and sixty
        shocks that had not been carried were nothing in comparison with the
        losses of others.
      </p>

      <p>
        After dinner Levin was sitting, as he usually did, in an easy chair with
        a book, and as he read he went on thinking of the journey before him in
        connection with his book. Today all the significance of his book rose
        before him with special distinctness, and whole periods ranged
        themselves in his mind in illustration of his theories. &ldquo;I must
        write that down,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;That ought to form a brief
        introduction, which I thought unnecessary before.&rdquo; He got up to go
        to his writing-table, and Laska, lying at his feet, got up too,
        stretching and looking at him as though to inquire where to go. But he
        had not time to write it down, for the head peasants had come round, and
        Levin went out into the hall to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        After his levee, that is to say, giving directions about the labors of
        the next day, and seeing all the peasants who had business with him,
        Levin went back to his study and sat down to work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Laska lay under the table; Agafea Mihalovna settled herself in her place
        with her stocking.
      </p>

      <p>
        After writing for a little while, Levin suddenly thought with
        exceptional vividness of Kitty, her refusal, and their last meeting. He
        got up and began walking about the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of being dreary?&rdquo; said Agafea
        Mihalovna. &ldquo;Come, why do you stay on at home? You ought to go to
        some warm springs, especially now you&rsquo;re ready for the
        journey.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I am going away the day after tomorrow, Agafea Mihalovna; I
        must finish my work.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There, there, your work, you say! As if you hadn&rsquo;t done
        enough for the peasants! Why, as &rsquo;tis, they&rsquo;re saying,
        &lsquo;Your master will be getting some honor from the Tsar for
        it.&rsquo; Indeed and it is a strange thing; why need you worry about
        the peasants?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worrying about them; I&rsquo;m doing it for my own
        good.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Agafea Mihalovna knew every detail of Levin&rsquo;s plans for his land.
        Levin often put his views before her in all their complexity, and not
        uncommonly he argued with her and did not agree with her comments. But
        on this occasion she entirely misinterpreted what he had said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of one&rsquo;s soul&rsquo;s salvation we all know and must think
        before all else,&rdquo; she said with a sigh. &ldquo;Parfen Denisitch
        now, for all he was no scholar, he died a death that God grant everyone
        of us the like,&rdquo; she said, referring to a servant who had died
        recently. &ldquo;Took the sacrament and all.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I mean,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I mean that
        I&rsquo;m acting for my own advantage. It&rsquo;s all the better for me
        if the peasants do their work better.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, whatever you do, if he&rsquo;s a lazy good-for-nought,
        everything&rsquo;ll be at sixes and sevens. If he has a conscience,
        he&rsquo;ll work, and if not, there&rsquo;s no doing anything.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, come, you say yourself Ivan has begun looking after the
        cattle better.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All I say is,&rdquo; answered Agafea Mihalovna, evidently not
        speaking at random, but in strict sequence of idea, &ldquo;that you
        ought to get married, that&rsquo;s what I say.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Agafea Mihalovna&rsquo;s allusion to the very subject he had only just
        been thinking about, hurt and stung him. Levin scowled, and without
        answering her, he sat down again to his work, repeating to himself all
        that he had been thinking of the real significance of that work. Only at
        intervals he listened in the stillness to the click of Agafea
        Mihalovna&rsquo;s needles, and recollecting what he did not want to
        remember, he frowned again.
      </p>

      <p>
        At nine o&rsquo;clock they heard the bell and the faint vibration of a
        carriage over the mud.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s visitors come to us, and you won&rsquo;t be
        dull,&rdquo; said Agafea Mihalovna, getting up and going to the door.
        But Levin overtook her. His work was not going well now, and he was glad
        of a visitor, whoever it might be.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 31</h3>

      <p>
        Running halfway down the staircase, Levin caught a sound he knew, a
        familiar cough in the hall. But he heard it indistinctly through the
        sound of his own footsteps, and hoped he was mistaken. Then he caught
        sight of a long, bony, familiar figure, and now it seemed there was no
        possibility of mistake; and yet he still went on hoping that this tall
        man taking off his fur cloak and coughing was not his brother Nikolay.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin loved his brother, but being with him was always a torture. Just
        now, when Levin, under the influence of the thoughts that had come to
        him, and Agafea Mihalovna&rsquo;s hint, was in a troubled and uncertain
        humor, the meeting with his brother that he had to face seemed
        particularly difficult. Instead of a lively, healthy visitor, some
        outsider who would, he hoped, cheer him up in his uncertain humor, he
        had to see his brother, who knew him through and through, who would call
        forth all the thoughts nearest his heart, would force him to show
        himself fully. And that he was not disposed to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        Angry with himself for so base a feeling, Levin ran into the hall; as
        soon as he had seen his brother close, this feeling of selfish
        disappointment vanished instantly and was replaced by pity. Terrible as
        his brother Nikolay had been before in his emaciation and sickliness,
        now he looked still more emaciated, still more wasted. He was a skeleton
        covered with skin.
      </p>

      <p>
        He stood in the hall, jerking his long thin neck, and pulling the scarf
        off it, and smiled a strange and pitiful smile. When he saw that smile,
        submissive and humble, Levin felt something clutching at his throat.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;ve come to you,&rdquo; said Nikolay in a thick
        voice, never for one second taking his eyes off his brother&rsquo;s
        face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been meaning to a long while, but I&rsquo;ve
        been unwell all the time. Now I&rsquo;m ever so much better,&rdquo; he
        said, rubbing his beard with his big thin hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; answered Levin. And he felt still more
        frightened when, kissing him, he felt with his lips the dryness of his
        brother&rsquo;s skin and saw close to him his big eyes, full of a
        strange light.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few weeks before, Konstantin Levin had written to his brother that
        through the sale of the small part of the property, that had remained
        undivided, there was a sum of about two thousand roubles to come to him
        as his share.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nikolay said that he had come now to take this money and, what was more
        important, to stay a while in the old nest, to get in touch with the
        earth, so as to renew his strength like the heroes of old for the work
        that lay before him. In spite of his exaggerated stoop, and the
        emaciation that was so striking from his height, his movements were as
        rapid and abrupt as ever. Levin led him into his study.
      </p>

      <p>
        His brother dressed with particular care&mdash;a thing he never used to
        do&mdash;combed his scanty, lank hair, and, smiling, went upstairs.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was in the most affectionate and good-humored mood, just as Levin
        often remembered him in childhood. He even referred to Sergey Ivanovitch
        without rancor. When he saw Agafea Mihalovna, he made jokes with her and
        asked after the old servants. The news of the death of Parfen Denisitch
        made a painful impression on him. A look of fear crossed his face, but
        he regained his serenity immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course he was quite old,&rdquo; he said, and changed the
        subject. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll spend a month or two with you, and then
        I&rsquo;m off to Moscow. Do you know, Myakov has promised me a place
        there, and I&rsquo;m going into the service. Now I&rsquo;m going to
        arrange my life quite differently,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;You know I
        got rid of that woman.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Marya Nikolaevna? Why, what for?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, she was a horrid woman! She caused me all sorts of
        worries.&rdquo; But he did not say what the annoyances were. He could
        not say that he had cast off Marya Nikolaevna because the tea was weak,
        and, above all, because she would look after him, as though he were an
        invalid.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Besides, I want to turn over a new leaf completely now.
        I&rsquo;ve done silly things, of course, like everyone else, but
        money&rsquo;s the last consideration; I don&rsquo;t regret it. So long
        as there&rsquo;s health, and my health, thank God, is quite
        restored.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin listened and racked his brains, but could think of nothing to say.
        Nikolay probably felt the same; he began questioning his brother about
        his affairs; and Levin was glad to talk about himself, because then he
        could speak without hypocrisy. He told his brother of his plans and his
        doings.
      </p>

      <p>
        His brother listened, but evidently he was not interested by it.
      </p>

      <p>
        These two men were so akin, so near each other, that the slightest
        gesture, the tone of voice, told both more than could be said in words.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both of them now had only one thought&mdash;the illness of Nikolay and
        the nearness of his death&mdash;which stifled all else. But neither of
        them dared to speak of it, and so whatever they said&mdash;not uttering
        the one thought that filled their minds&mdash;was all falsehood. Never
        had Levin been so glad when the evening was over and it was time to go
        to bed. Never with any outside person, never on any official visit had
        he been so unnatural and false as he was that evening. And the
        consciousness of this unnaturalness, and the remorse he felt at it, made
        him even more unnatural. He wanted to weep over his dying, dearly loved
        brother, and he had to listen and keep on talking of how he meant to
        live.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the house was damp, and only one bedroom had been kept heated, Levin
        put his brother to sleep in his own bedroom behind a screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        His brother got into bed, and whether he slept or did not sleep, tossed
        about like a sick man, coughed, and when he could not get his throat
        clear, mumbled something. Sometimes when his breathing was painful, he
        said, &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; Sometimes when he was choking he
        muttered angrily, &ldquo;Ah, the devil!&rdquo; Levin could not sleep for
        a long while, hearing him. His thoughts were of the most various, but
        the end of all his thoughts was the same&mdash;death. Death, the
        inevitable end of all, for the first time presented itself to him with
        irresistible force. And death, which was here in this loved brother,
        groaning half asleep and from habit calling without distinction on God
        and the devil, was not so remote as it had hitherto seemed to him. It
        was in himself too, he felt that. If not today, tomorrow, if not
        tomorrow, in thirty years, wasn&rsquo;t it all the same! And what was
        this inevitable death&mdash;he did not know, had never thought about it,
        and what was more, had not the power, had not the courage to think about
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I work, I want to do something, but I had forgotten it must all
        end; I had forgotten&mdash;death.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He sat on his bed in the darkness, crouched up, hugging his knees, and
        holding his breath from the strain of thought, he pondered. But the more
        intensely he thought, the clearer it became to him that it was
        indubitably so, that in reality, looking upon life, he had forgotten one
        little fact&mdash;that death will come, and all ends; that nothing was
        even worth beginning, and that there was no helping it anyway. Yes, it
        was awful, but it was so.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I am alive still. Now what&rsquo;s to be done? what&rsquo;s
        to be done?&rdquo; he said in despair. He lighted a candle, got up
        cautiously and went to the looking-glass, and began looking at his face
        and hair. Yes, there were gray hairs about his temples. He opened his
        mouth. His back teeth were beginning to decay. He bared his muscular
        arms. Yes, there was strength in them. But Nikolay, who lay there
        breathing with what was left of lungs, had had a strong, healthy body
        too. And suddenly he recalled how they used to go to bed together as
        children, and how they only waited till Fyodor Bogdanitch was out of the
        room to fling pillows at each other and laugh, laugh irrepressibly, so
        that even their awe of Fyodor Bogdanitch could not check the
        effervescing, overbrimming sense of life and happiness. &ldquo;And now
        that bent, hollow chest ... and I, not knowing what will become of me,
        or wherefore....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;K...ha! K...ha! Damnation! Why do you keep fidgeting, why
        don&rsquo;t you go to sleep?&rdquo; his brother&rsquo;s voice called to
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not sleepy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have had a good sleep, I&rsquo;m not in a sweat now. Just see,
        feel my shirt; it&rsquo;s not wet, is it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin felt, withdrew behind the screen, and put out the candle, but for
        a long while he could not sleep. The question how to live had hardly
        begun to grow a little clearer to him, when a new, insoluble question
        presented itself&mdash;death.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s dying&mdash;yes, he&rsquo;ll die in the spring,
        and how help him? What can I say to him? What do I know about it?
        I&rsquo;d even forgotten that it was at all.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 32</h3>

      <p>
        Levin had long before made the observation that when one is
        uncomfortable with people from their being excessively amenable and
        meek, one is apt very soon after to find things intolerable from their
        touchiness and irritability. He felt that this was how it would be with
        his brother. And his brother Nikolay&rsquo;s gentleness did in fact not
        last out for long. The very next morning he began to be irritable, and
        seemed doing his best to find fault with his brother, attacking him on
        his tenderest points.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin felt himself to blame, and could not set things right. He felt
        that if they had both not kept up appearances, but had spoken, as it is
        called, from the heart&mdash;that is to say, had said only just what
        they were thinking and feeling&mdash;they would simply have looked into
        each other&rsquo;s faces, and Konstantin could only have said,
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re dying, you&rsquo;re dying!&rdquo; and Nikolay could
        only have answered, &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m dying, but I&rsquo;m afraid,
        I&rsquo;m afraid, I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo; And they could have said
        nothing more, if they had said only what was in their hearts. But life
        like that was impossible, and so Konstantin tried to do what he had been
        trying to do all his life, and never could learn to do, though, as far
        as he could observe, many people knew so well how to do it, and without
        it there was no living at all. He tried to say what he was not thinking,
        but he felt continually that it had a ring of falsehood, that his
        brother detected him in it, and was exasperated at it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The third day Nikolay induced his brother to explain his plan to him
        again, and began not merely attacking it, but intentionally confounding
        it with communism.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve simply borrowed an idea that&rsquo;s not your own,
        but you&rsquo;ve distorted it, and are trying to apply it where
        it&rsquo;s not applicable.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I tell you it&rsquo;s nothing to do with it. They deny the
        justice of property, of capital, of inheritance, while I do not deny
        this chief stimulus.&rdquo; (Levin felt disgusted himself at using such
        expressions, but ever since he had been engrossed by his work, he had
        unconsciously come more and more frequently to use words not Russian.)
        &ldquo;All I want is to regulate labor.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Which means, you&rsquo;ve borrowed an idea, stripped it of all
        that gave it its force, and want to make believe that it&rsquo;s
        something new,&rdquo; said Nikolay, angrily tugging at his necktie.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But my idea has nothing in common....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That, anyway,&rdquo; said Nikolay Levin, with an ironical smile,
        his eyes flashing malignantly, &ldquo;has the charm
        of&mdash;what&rsquo;s one to call it?&mdash;geometrical symmetry, of
        clearness, of definiteness. It may be a Utopia. But if once one allows
        the possibility of making of all the past a
        <i>tabula rasa</i>&mdash;no property, no family&mdash;then labor would
        organize itself. But you gain nothing....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why do you mix things up? I&rsquo;ve never been a
        communist.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I have, and I consider it&rsquo;s premature, but rational,
        and it has a future, just like Christianity in its first ages.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All that I maintain is that the labor force ought to be
        investigated from the point of view of natural science; that is to say,
        it ought to be studied, its qualities ascertained....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s utter waste of time. That force finds a certain
        form of activity of itself, according to the stage of its development.
        There have been slaves first everywhere, then metayers; and we have the
        half-crop system, rent, and day laborers. What are you trying to
        find?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin suddenly lost his temper at these words, because at the bottom of
        his heart he was afraid that it was true&mdash;true that he was trying
        to hold the balance even between communism and the familiar forms, and
        that this was hardly possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am trying to find means of working productively for myself and
        for the laborers. I want to organize....&rdquo; he answered hotly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to organize anything; it&rsquo;s simply just
        as you&rsquo;ve been all your life, that you want to be original to pose
        as not exploiting the peasants simply, but with some idea in
        view.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, all right, that&rsquo;s what you think&mdash;and let me
        alone!&rdquo; answered Levin, feeling the muscles of his left cheek
        twitching uncontrollably.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never had, and never have, convictions; all you want
        is to please your vanity.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, very well; then let me alone!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And I will let you alone! and it&rsquo;s high time I did, and go
        to the devil with you! and I&rsquo;m very sorry I ever came!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        In spite of all Levin&rsquo;s efforts to soothe his brother afterwards,
        Nikolay would listen to nothing he said, declaring that it was better to
        part, and Konstantin saw that it simply was that life was unbearable to
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nikolay was just getting ready to go, when Konstantin went in to him
        again and begged him, rather unnaturally, to forgive him if he had hurt
        his feelings in any way.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, generosity!&rdquo; said Nikolay, and he smiled. &ldquo;If you
        want to be right, I can give you that satisfaction. You&rsquo;re in the
        right; but I&rsquo;m going all the same.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        It was only just at parting that Nikolay kissed him, and said, looking
        with sudden strangeness and seriousness at his brother:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anyway, don&rsquo;t remember evil against me, Kostya!&rdquo; and
        his voice quivered. These were the only words that had been spoken
        sincerely between them. Levin knew that those words meant, &ldquo;You
        see, and you know, that I&rsquo;m in a bad way, and maybe we shall not
        see each other again.&rdquo; Levin knew this, and the tears gushed from
        his eyes. He kissed his brother once more, but he could not speak, and
        knew not what to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        Three days after his brother&rsquo;s departure, Levin too set off for
        his foreign tour. Happening to meet Shtcherbatsky, Kitty&rsquo;s cousin,
        in the railway train, Levin greatly astonished him by his depression.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; Shtcherbatsky asked him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, nothing; there&rsquo;s not much happiness in life.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not much? You come with me to Paris instead of to Mulhausen. You
        shall see how to be happy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve done with it all. It&rsquo;s time I was
        dead.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a good one!&rdquo; said Shtcherbatsky,
        laughing; &ldquo;why, I&rsquo;m only just getting ready to begin.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I thought the same not long ago, but now I know I shall soon
        be dead.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin said what he had genuinely been thinking of late. He saw nothing
        but death or the advance towards death in everything. But his cherished
        scheme only engrossed him the more. Life had to be got through somehow
        till death did come. Darkness had fallen upon everything for him; but
        just because of this darkness he felt that the one guiding clue in the
        darkness was his work, and he clutched it and clung to it with all his
        strength.

      <h2>PART FOUR</h2>

      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>

      <p>
        The Karenins, husband and wife, continued living in the same house, met
        every day, but were complete strangers to one another. Alexey
        Alexandrovitch made it a rule to see his wife every day, so that the
        servants might have no grounds for suppositions, but avoided dining at
        home. Vronsky was never at Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s house, but Anna
        saw him away from home, and her husband was aware of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The position was one of misery for all three; and not one of them would
        have been equal to enduring this position for a single day, if it had
        not been for the expectation that it would change, that it was merely a
        temporary painful ordeal which would pass over. Alexey Alexandrovitch
        hoped that this passion would pass, as everything does pass, that
        everyone would forget about it, and his name would remain unsullied.
        Anna, on whom the position depended, and for whom it was more miserable
        than for anyone, endured it because she not merely hoped, but firmly
        believed, that it would all very soon be settled and come right. She had
        not the least idea what would settle the position, but she firmly
        believed that something would very soon turn up now. Vronsky, against
        his own will or wishes, followed her lead, hoped too that something,
        apart from his own action, would be sure to solve all difficulties.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the middle of the winter Vronsky spent a very tiresome week. A
        foreign prince, who had come on a visit to Petersburg, was put under his
        charge, and he had to show him the sights worth seeing. Vronsky was of
        distinguished appearance; he possessed, moreover, the art of behaving
        with respectful dignity, and was used to having to do with such grand
        personages&mdash;that was how he came to be put in charge of the prince.
        But he felt his duties very irksome. The prince was anxious to miss
        nothing of which he would be asked at home, had he seen that in Russia?
        And on his own account he was anxious to enjoy to the utmost all Russian
        forms of amusement. Vronsky was obliged to be his guide in satisfying
        both these inclinations. The mornings they spent driving to look at
        places of interest; the evenings they passed enjoying the national
        entertainments. The prince rejoiced in health exceptional even among
        princes. By gymnastics and careful attention to his health he had
        brought himself to such a point that in spite of his excess in pleasure
        he looked as fresh as a big glossy green Dutch cucumber. The prince had
        traveled a great deal, and considered one of the chief advantages of
        modern facilities of communication was the accessibility of the
        pleasures of all nations.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had been in Spain, and there had indulged in serenades and had made
        friends with a Spanish girl who played the mandolin. In Switzerland he
        had killed chamois. In England he had galloped in a red coat over hedges
        and killed two hundred pheasants for a bet. In Turkey he had got into a
        harem; in India he had hunted on an elephant, and now in Russia he
        wished to taste all the specially Russian forms of pleasure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky, who was, as it were, chief master of the ceremonies to him, was
        at great pains to arrange all the Russian amusements suggested by
        various persons to the prince. They had race horses, and Russian
        pancakes and bear hunts and three-horse sledges, and gypsies and
        drinking feasts, with the Russian accompaniment of broken crockery. And
        the prince with surprising ease fell in with the Russian spirit, smashed
        trays full of crockery, sat with a gypsy girl on his knee, and seemed to
        be asking&mdash;what more, and does the whole Russian spirit consist in
        just this?
      </p>

      <p>
        In reality, of all the Russian entertainments the prince liked best
        French actresses and ballet dancers and white-seal champagne. Vronsky
        was used to princes, but, either because he had himself changed of late,
        or that he was in too close proximity to the prince, that week seemed
        fearfully wearisome to him. The whole of that week he experienced a
        sensation such as a man might have set in charge of a dangerous madman,
        afraid of the madman, and at the same time, from being with him, fearing
        for his own reason. Vronsky was continually conscious of the necessity
        of never for a second relaxing the tone of stern official
        respectfulness, that he might not himself be insulted. The
        prince&rsquo;s manner of treating the very people who, to
        Vronsky&rsquo;s surprise, were ready to descend to any depths to provide
        him with Russian amusements, was contemptuous. His criticisms of Russian
        women, whom he wished to study, more than once made Vronsky crimson with
        indignation. The chief reason why the prince was so particularly
        disagreeable to Vronsky was that he could not help seeing himself in
        him. And what he saw in this mirror did not gratify his self-esteem. He
        was a very stupid and very self-satisfied and very healthy and very
        well-washed man, and nothing else. He was a gentleman&mdash;that was
        true, and Vronsky could not deny it. He was equable and not cringing
        with his superiors, was free and ingratiating in his behavior with his
        equals, and was contemptuously indulgent with his inferiors. Vronsky was
        himself the same, and regarded it as a great merit to be so. But for
        this prince he was an inferior, and his contemptuous and indulgent
        attitude to him revolted him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Brainless beef! can I be like that?&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        Be that as it might, when, on the seventh day, he parted from the
        prince, who was starting for Moscow, and received his thanks, he was
        happy to be rid of his uncomfortable position and the unpleasant
        reflection of himself. He said good-bye to him at the station on their
        return from a bear hunt, at which they had had a display of Russian
        prowess kept up all night.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

      <p>
        When he got home, Vronsky found there a note from Anna. She wrote,
        &ldquo;I am ill and unhappy. I cannot come out, but I cannot go on
        longer without seeing you. Come in this evening. Alexey Alexandrovitch
        goes to the council at seven and will be there till ten.&rdquo; Thinking
        for an instant of the strangeness of her bidding him come straight to
        her, in spite of her husband&rsquo;s insisting on her not receiving him,
        he decided to go.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky had that winter got his promotion, was now a colonel, had left
        the regimental quarters, and was living alone. After having some lunch,
        he lay down on the sofa immediately, and in five minutes memories of the
        hideous scenes he had witnessed during the last few days were confused
        together and joined on to a mental image of Anna and of the peasant who
        had played an important part in the bear hunt, and Vronsky fell asleep.
        He waked up in the dark, trembling with horror, and made haste to light
        a candle. &ldquo;What was it? What? What was the dreadful thing I
        dreamed? Yes, yes; I think a little dirty man with a disheveled beard
        was stooping down doing something, and all of a sudden he began saying
        some strange words in French. Yes, there was nothing else in the
        dream,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;But why was it so awful?&rdquo;
        He vividly recalled the peasant again and those incomprehensible French
        words the peasant had uttered, and a chill of horror ran down his spine.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; thought Vronsky, and glanced at his watch.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was half-past eight already. He rang up his servant, dressed in
        haste, and went out onto the steps, completely forgetting the dream and
        only worried at being late. As he drove up to the Karenins&rsquo;
        entrance he looked at his watch and saw it was ten minutes to nine. A
        high, narrow carriage with a pair of grays was standing at the entrance.
        He recognized Anna&rsquo;s carriage. &ldquo;She is coming to me,&rdquo;
        thought Vronsky, &ldquo;and better she should. I don&rsquo;t like going
        into that house. But no matter; I can&rsquo;t hide myself,&rdquo; he
        thought, and with that manner peculiar to him from childhood, as of a
        man who has nothing to be ashamed of, Vronsky got out of his sledge and
        went to the door. The door opened, and the hall-porter with a rug on his
        arm called the carriage. Vronsky, though he did not usually notice
        details, noticed at this moment the amazed expression with which the
        porter glanced at him. In the very doorway Vronsky almost ran up against
        Alexey Alexandrovitch. The gas jet threw its full light on the
        bloodless, sunken face under the black hat and on the white cravat,
        brilliant against the beaver of the coat. Karenin&rsquo;s fixed, dull
        eyes were fastened upon Vronsky&rsquo;s face. Vronsky bowed, and Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, chewing his lips, lifted his hand to his hat and went
        on. Vronsky saw him without looking round get into the carriage, pick up
        the rug and the opera-glass at the window and disappear. Vronsky went
        into the hall. His brows were scowling, and his eyes gleamed with a
        proud and angry light in them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a position!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;If he would fight,
        would stand up for his honor, I could act, could express my feelings;
        but this weakness or baseness.... He puts me in the position of playing
        false, which I never meant and never mean to do.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky&rsquo;s ideas had changed since the day of his conversation with
        Anna in the Vrede garden. Unconsciously yielding to the weakness of
        Anna&mdash;who had surrendered herself up to him utterly, and simply
        looked to him to decide her fate, ready to submit to anything&mdash;he
        had long ceased to think that their tie might end as he had thought
        then. His ambitious plans had retreated into the background again, and
        feeling that he had got out of that circle of activity in which
        everything was definite, he had given himself entirely to his passion,
        and that passion was binding him more and more closely to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was still in the hall when he caught the sound of her retreating
        footsteps. He knew she had been expecting him, had listened for him, and
        was now going back to the drawing-room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she cried, on seeing him, and at the first sound of
        her voice the tears came into her eyes. &ldquo;No; if things are to go
        on like this, the end will come much, much too soon.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it, dear one?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What? I&rsquo;ve been waiting in agony for an hour, two hours ...
        No, I won&rsquo;t ... I can&rsquo;t quarrel with you. Of course you
        couldn&rsquo;t come. No, I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She laid her two hands on
        his shoulders, and looked a long while at him with a profound,
        passionate, and at the same time searching look. She was studying his
        face to make up for the time she had not seen him. She was, every time
        she saw him, making the picture of him in her imagination (incomparably
        superior, impossible in reality) fit with him as he really was.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 3</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You met him?&rdquo; she asked, when they had sat down at the
        table in the lamplight. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re punished, you see, for being
        late.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but how was it? Wasn&rsquo;t he to be at the council?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He had been and come back, and was going out somewhere again. But
        that&rsquo;s no matter. Don&rsquo;t talk about it. Where have you been?
        With the prince still?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She knew every detail of his existence. He was going to say that he had
        been up all night and had dropped asleep, but looking at her thrilled
        and rapturous face, he was ashamed. And he said he had had to go to
        report on the prince&rsquo;s departure.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s over now? He is gone?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank God it&rsquo;s over! You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how
        insufferable it&rsquo;s been for me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so? Isn&rsquo;t it the life all of you, all young men, always
        lead?&rdquo; she said, knitting her brows; and taking up the crochet
        work that was lying on the table, she began drawing the hook out of it,
        without looking at Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I gave that life up long ago,&rdquo; said he, wondering at the
        change in her face, and trying to divine its meaning. &ldquo;And I
        confess,&rdquo; he said, with a smile, showing his thick, white teeth,
        &ldquo;this week I&rsquo;ve been, as it were, looking at myself in a
        glass, seeing that life, and I didn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She held the work in her hands, but did not crochet, and looked at him
        with strange, shining, and hostile eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This morning Liza came to see me&mdash;they&rsquo;re not afraid
        to call on me, in spite of the Countess Lidia Ivanovna,&rdquo; she put
        in&mdash;&ldquo;and she told me about your Athenian evening. How
        loathsome!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I was just going to say....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She interrupted him. &ldquo;It was that Thérèse you used to know?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I was just saying....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How disgusting you are, you men! How is it you can&rsquo;t
        understand that a woman can never forget that,&rdquo; she said, getting
        more and more angry, and so letting him see the cause of her irritation,
        &ldquo;especially a woman who cannot know your life? What do I know?
        What have I ever known?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what you tell me. And
        how do I know whether you tell me the truth?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna, you hurt me. Don&rsquo;t you trust me? Haven&rsquo;t I told
        you that I haven&rsquo;t a thought I wouldn&rsquo;t lay bare to
        you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she said, evidently trying to suppress her
        jealous thoughts. &ldquo;But if only you knew how wretched I am! I
        believe you, I believe you.... What were you saying?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But he could not at once recall what he had been going to say. These
        fits of jealousy, which of late had been more and more frequent with
        her, horrified him, and however much he tried to disguise the fact, made
        him feel cold to her, although he knew the cause of her jealousy was her
        love for him. How often he had told himself that her love was happiness;
        and now she loved him as a woman can love when love has outweighed for
        her all the good things of life&mdash;and he was much further from
        happiness than when he had followed her from Moscow. Then he had thought
        himself unhappy, but happiness was before him; now he felt that the best
        happiness was already left behind. She was utterly unlike what she had
        been when he first saw her. Both morally and physically she had changed
        for the worse. She had broadened out all over, and in her face at the
        time when she was speaking of the actress there was an evil expression
        of hatred that distorted it. He looked at her as a man looks at a faded
        flower he has gathered, with difficulty recognizing in it the beauty for
        which he picked and ruined it. And in spite of this he felt that then,
        when his love was stronger, he could, if he had greatly wished it, have
        torn that love out of his heart; but now, when as at that moment it
        seemed to him he felt no love for her, he knew that what bound him to
        her could not be broken.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, well, what was it you were going to say about the prince? I
        have driven away the fiend,&rdquo; she added. The fiend was the name
        they had given her jealousy. &ldquo;What did you begin to tell me about
        the prince? Why did you find it so tiresome?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it was intolerable!&rdquo; he said, trying to pick up the
        thread of his interrupted thought. &ldquo;He does not improve on closer
        acquaintance. If you want him defined, here he is: a prime, well-fed
        beast such as takes medals at the cattle shows, and nothing more,&rdquo;
        he said, with a tone of vexation that interested her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; how so?&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s seen a great
        deal, anyway; he&rsquo;s cultured?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an utterly different culture&mdash;their culture.
        He&rsquo;s cultivated, one sees, simply to be able to despise culture,
        as they despise everything but animal pleasures.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you all care for these animal pleasures?&rdquo;
        she said, and again he noticed a dark look in her eyes that avoided him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How is it you&rsquo;re defending him?&rdquo; he said, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not defending him, it&rsquo;s nothing to me; but I
        imagine, if you had not cared for those pleasures yourself, you might
        have got out of them. But if it affords you satisfaction to gaze at
        Thérèse in the attire of Eve....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Again, the devil again,&rdquo; Vronsky said, taking the hand she
        had laid on the table and kissing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but I can&rsquo;t help it. You don&rsquo;t know what I have
        suffered waiting for you. I believe I&rsquo;m not jealous. I&rsquo;m not
        jealous: I believe you when you&rsquo;re here; but when you&rsquo;re
        away somewhere leading your life, so incomprehensible to me....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She turned away from him, pulled the hook at last out of the crochet
        work, and rapidly, with the help of her forefinger, began working loop
        after loop of the wool that was dazzling white in the lamplight, while
        the slender wrist moved swiftly, nervously in the embroidered cuff.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How was it, then? Where did you meet Alexey
        Alexandrovitch?&rdquo; Her voice sounded in an unnatural and jarring
        tone.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We ran up against each other in the doorway.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And he bowed to you like this?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She drew a long face, and half-closing her eyes, quickly transformed her
        expression, folded her hands, and Vronsky suddenly saw in her beautiful
        face the very expression with which Alexey Alexandrovitch had bowed to
        him. He smiled, while she laughed gaily, with that sweet, deep laugh,
        which was one of her greatest charms.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand him in the least,&rdquo; said Vronsky.
        &ldquo;If after your avowal to him at your country house he had broken
        with you, if he had called me out&mdash;but this I can&rsquo;t
        understand. How can he put up with such a position? He feels it,
        that&rsquo;s evident.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He?&rdquo; she said sneeringly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s perfectly
        satisfied.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What are we all miserable for, when everything might be so
        happy?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Only not he. Don&rsquo;t I know him, the falsity in which
        he&rsquo;s utterly steeped?... Could one, with any feeling, live as he
        is living with me? He understands nothing, and feels nothing. Could a
        man of any feeling live in the same house with his unfaithful wife?
        Could he talk to her, call her &lsquo;my dear&rsquo;?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And again she could not help mimicking him: &ldquo;&lsquo;Anna,
        <i>ma chère</i>; Anna, dear!&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a man, not a human being&mdash;he&rsquo;s a doll!
        No one knows him; but I know him. Oh, if I&rsquo;d been in his place,
        I&rsquo;d long ago have killed, have torn to pieces a wife like me. I
        wouldn&rsquo;t have said, &lsquo;Anna, <i>ma chère</i>&rsquo;!
        He&rsquo;s not a man, he&rsquo;s an official machine. He doesn&rsquo;t
        understand that I&rsquo;m your wife, that he&rsquo;s outside, that
        he&rsquo;s superfluous.... Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk of
        him!...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re unfair, very unfair, dearest,&rdquo; said Vronsky,
        trying to soothe her. &ldquo;But never mind, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s
        talk of him. Tell me what you&rsquo;ve been doing? What is the matter?
        What has been wrong with you, and what did the doctor say?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She looked at him with mocking amusement. Evidently she had hit on other
        absurd and grotesque aspects in her husband and was awaiting the moment
        to give expression to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        But he went on:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I imagine that it&rsquo;s not illness, but your condition. When
        will it be?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The ironical light died away in her eyes, but a different smile, a
        consciousness of something, he did not know what, and of quiet
        melancholy, came over her face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Soon, soon. You say that our position is miserable, that we must
        put an end to it. If you knew how terrible it is to me, what I would
        give to be able to love you freely and boldly! I should not torture
        myself and torture you with my jealousy.... And it will come soon, but
        not as we expect.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And at the thought of how it would come, she seemed so pitiable to
        herself that tears came into her eyes, and she could not go on. She laid
        her hand on his sleeve, dazzling and white with its rings in the
        lamplight.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t come as we suppose. I didn&rsquo;t mean to say
        this to you, but you&rsquo;ve made me. Soon, soon, all will be over, and
        we shall all, all be at peace, and suffer no more.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he said, understanding her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You asked when? Soon. And I shan&rsquo;t live through it.
        Don&rsquo;t interrupt me!&rdquo; and she made haste to speak. &ldquo;I
        know it; I know for certain. I shall die; and I&rsquo;m very glad I
        shall die, and release myself and you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Tears dropped from her eyes; he bent down over her hand and began
        kissing it, trying to hide his emotion, which, he knew, had no sort of
        grounds, though he could not control it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s better so,&rdquo; she said, tightly gripping his
        hand. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only way, the only way left us.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He had recovered himself, and lifted his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How absurd! What absurd nonsense you are talking!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s the truth.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What, what&rsquo;s the truth?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That I shall die. I have had a dream.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A dream?&rdquo; repeated Vronsky, and instantly he recalled the
        peasant of his dream.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, a dream,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long while
        since I dreamed it. I dreamed that I ran into my bedroom, that I had to
        get something there, to find out something; you know how it is in
        dreams,&rdquo; she said, her eyes wide with horror; &ldquo;and in the
        bedroom, in the corner, stood something.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, what nonsense! How can you believe....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But she would not let him interrupt her. What she was saying was too
        important to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And the something turned round, and I saw it was a peasant with a
        disheveled beard, little, and dreadful looking. I wanted to run away,
        but he bent down over a sack, and was fumbling there with his
        hands....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She showed how he had moved his hands. There was terror in her face. And
        Vronsky, remembering his dream, felt the same terror filling his soul.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He was fumbling and kept talking quickly, quickly in French, you
        know:
        <i>Il faut le battre, le fer, le broyer, le pétrir</i>.... And in my
        horror I tried to wake up, and woke up ... but woke up in the dream. And
        I began asking myself what it meant. And Korney said to me: &lsquo;In
        childbirth you&rsquo;ll die, ma&rsquo;am, you&rsquo;ll die....&rsquo;
        And I woke up.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What nonsense, what nonsense!&rdquo; said Vronsky; but he felt
        himself that there was no conviction in his voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk of it. Ring the bell, I&rsquo;ll
        have tea. And stay a little now; it&rsquo;s not long I shall....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But all at once she stopped. The expression of her face instantaneously
        changed. Horror and excitement were suddenly replaced by a look of soft,
        solemn, blissful attention. He could not comprehend the meaning of the
        change. She was listening to the stirring of the new life within her.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 4</h3>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch, after meeting Vronsky on his own steps, drove, as
        he had intended, to the Italian opera. He sat through two acts there,
        and saw everyone he had wanted to see. On returning home, he carefully
        scrutinized the hat stand, and noticing that there was not a military
        overcoat there, he went, as usual, to his own room. But, contrary to his
        usual habit, he did not go to bed, he walked up and down his study till
        three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The feeling of furious anger with
        his wife, who would not observe the proprieties and keep to the one
        stipulation he had laid on her, not to receive her lover in her own
        home, gave him no peace. She had not complied with his request, and he
        was bound to punish her and carry out his threat&mdash;obtain a divorce
        and take away his son. He knew all the difficulties connected with this
        course, but he had said he would do it, and now he must carry out his
        threat. Countess Lidia Ivanovna had hinted that this was the best way
        out of his position, and of late the obtaining of divorces had been
        brought to such perfection that Alexey Alexandrovitch saw a possibility
        of overcoming the formal difficulties. Misfortunes never come singly,
        and the affairs of the reorganization of the native tribes, and of the
        irrigation of the lands of the Zaraisky province, had brought such
        official worries upon Alexey Alexandrovitch that he had been of late in
        a continual condition of extreme irritability.
      </p>

      <p>
        He did not sleep the whole night, and his fury, growing in a sort of
        vast, arithmetical progression, reached its highest limits in the
        morning. He dressed in haste, and as though carrying his cup full of
        wrath, and fearing to spill any over, fearing to lose with his wrath the
        energy necessary for the interview with his wife, he went into her room
        directly he heard she was up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna, who had thought she knew her husband so well, was amazed at his
        appearance when he went in to her. His brow was lowering, and his eyes
        stared darkly before him, avoiding her eyes; his mouth was tightly and
        contemptuously shut. In his walk, in his gestures, in the sound of his
        voice there was a determination and firmness such as his wife had never
        seen in him. He went into her room, and without greeting her, walked
        straight up to her writing-table, and taking her keys, opened a drawer.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she cried.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Your lover&rsquo;s letters,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not here,&rdquo; she said, shutting the drawer; but
        from that action he saw he had guessed right, and roughly pushing away
        her hand, he quickly snatched a portfolio in which he knew she used to
        put her most important papers. She tried to pull the portfolio away, but
        he pushed her back.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Sit down! I have to speak to you,&rdquo; he said, putting the
        portfolio under his arm, and squeezing it so tightly with his elbow that
        his shoulder stood up. Amazed and intimidated, she gazed at him in
        silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I told you that I would not allow you to receive your lover in
        this house.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I had to see him to....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She stopped, not finding a reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not enter into the details of why a woman wants to see her
        lover.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I meant, I only....&rdquo; she said, flushing hotly. This
        coarseness of his angered her, and gave her courage. &ldquo;Surely you
        must feel how easy it is for you to insult me?&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;An honest man and an honest woman may be insulted, but to tell a
        thief he&rsquo;s a thief is simply
        <i>la constatation d&rsquo;un fait</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This cruelty is something new I did not know in you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You call it cruelty for a husband to give his wife liberty,
        giving her the honorable protection of his name, simply on the condition
        of observing the proprieties: is that cruelty?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than cruel&mdash;it&rsquo;s base, if you want to
        know!&rdquo; Anna cried, in a rush of hatred, and getting up, she was
        going away.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he shrieked, in his shrill voice, which pitched a note
        higher than usual even, and his big hands clutching her by the arm so
        violently that red marks were left from the bracelet he was squeezing,
        he forcibly sat her down in her place.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Base! If you care to use that word, what is base is to forsake
        husband and child for a lover, while you eat your husband&rsquo;s
        bread!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She bowed her head. She did not say what she had said the evening before
        to her lover, that <i>he</i> was her husband, and her husband was
        superfluous; she did not even think that. She felt all the justice of
        his words, and only said softly:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You cannot describe my position as worse than I feel it to be
        myself; but what are you saying all this for?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What am I saying it for? what for?&rdquo; he went on, as angrily.
        &ldquo;That you may know that since you have not carried out my wishes
        in regard to observing outward decorum, I will take measures to put an
        end to this state of things.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Soon, very soon, it will end, anyway,&rdquo; she said; and again,
        at the thought of death near at hand and now desired, tears came into
        her eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It will end sooner than you and your lover have planned! If you
        must have the satisfaction of animal passion....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey Alexandrovitch! I won&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s not generous,
        but it&rsquo;s not like a gentleman to strike anyone who&rsquo;s
        down.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you only think of yourself! But the sufferings of a man who
        was your husband have no interest for you. You don&rsquo;t care that his
        whole life is ruined, that he is thuff ... thuff....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch was speaking so quickly that he stammered, and was
        utterly unable to articulate the word &ldquo;suffering.&rdquo; In the
        end he pronounced it &ldquo;thuffering.&rdquo; She wanted to laugh, and
        was immediately ashamed that anything could amuse her at such a moment.
        And for the first time, for an instant, she felt for him, put herself in
        his place, and was sorry for him. But what could she say or do? Her head
        sank, and she sat silent. He too was silent for some time, and then
        began speaking in a frigid, less shrill voice, emphasizing random words
        that had no special significance.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I came to tell you....&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        She glanced at him. &ldquo;No, it was my fancy,&rdquo; she thought,
        recalling the expression of his face when he stumbled over the word
        &ldquo;suffering.&rdquo; &ldquo;No; can a man with those dull eyes, with
        that self-satisfied complacency, feel anything?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot change anything,&rdquo; she whispered.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have come to tell you that I am going tomorrow to Moscow, and
        shall not return again to this house, and you will receive notice of
        what I decide through the lawyer into whose hands I shall intrust the
        task of getting a divorce. My son is going to my sister&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
        said Alexey Alexandrovitch, with an effort recalling what he had meant
        to say about his son.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You take Seryozha to hurt me,&rdquo; she said, looking at him
        from under her brows. &ldquo;You do not love him.... Leave me
        Seryozha!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I have lost even my affection for my son, because he is
        associated with the repulsion I feel for you. But still I shall take
        him. Good-bye!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he was going away, but now she detained him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey Alexandrovitch, leave me Seryozha!&rdquo; she whispered
        once more. &ldquo;I have nothing else to say. Leave Seryozha till my ...
        I shall soon be confined; leave him!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch flew into a rage, and, snatching his hand from
        her, he went out of the room without a word.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 5</h3>

      <p>
        The waiting-room of the celebrated Petersburg lawyer was full when
        Alexey Alexandrovitch entered it. Three ladies&mdash;an old lady, a
        young lady, and a merchant&rsquo;s wife&mdash;and three
        gentlemen&mdash;one a German banker with a ring on his finger, the
        second a merchant with a beard, and the third a wrathful-looking
        government clerk in official uniform, with a cross on his neck&mdash;had
        obviously been waiting a long while already. Two clerks were writing at
        tables with scratching pens. The appurtenances of the writing-tables,
        about which Alexey Alexandrovitch was himself very fastidious, were
        exceptionally good. He could not help observing this. One of the clerks,
        without getting up, turned wrathfully to Alexey Alexandrovitch, half
        closing his eyes. &ldquo;What are you wanting?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He replied that he had to see the lawyer on some business.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He is engaged,&rdquo; the clerk responded severely, and he
        pointed with his pen at the persons waiting, and went on writing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t he spare time to see me?&rdquo; said Alexey
        Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He has no time free; he is always busy. Kindly wait your
        turn.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then I must trouble you to give him my card,&rdquo; Alexey
        Alexandrovitch said with dignity, seeing the impossibility of preserving
        his incognito.
      </p>

      <p>
        The clerk took the card and, obviously not approving of what he read on
        it, went to the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch was in principle in favor of the publicity of
        legal proceedings, though for some higher official considerations he
        disliked the application of the principle in Russia, and disapproved of
        it, as far as he could disapprove of anything instituted by authority of
        the Emperor. His whole life had been spent in administrative work, and
        consequently, when he did not approve of anything, his disapproval was
        softened by the recognition of the inevitability of mistakes and the
        possibility of reform in every department. In the new public law courts
        he disliked the restrictions laid on the lawyers conducting cases. But
        till then he had had nothing to do with the law courts, and so had
        disapproved of their publicity simply in theory; now his disapprobation
        was strengthened by the unpleasant impression made on him in the
        lawyer&rsquo;s waiting room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Coming immediately,&rdquo; said the clerk; and two minutes later
        there did actually appear in the doorway the large figure of an old
        solicitor who had been consulting with the lawyer himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lawyer was a little, squat, bald man, with a dark, reddish beard,
        light-colored long eyebrows, and an overhanging brow. He was attired as
        though for a wedding, from his cravat to his double watch-chain and
        varnished boots. His face was clever and manly, but his dress was
        dandified and in bad taste.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Pray walk in,&rdquo; said the lawyer, addressing Alexey
        Alexandrovitch; and, gloomily ushering Karenin in before him, he closed
        the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo; He indicated an armchair at a
        writing-table covered with papers. He sat down himself, and, rubbing his
        little hands with short fingers covered with white hairs, he bent his
        head on one side. But as soon as he was settled in this position a moth
        flew over the table. The lawyer, with a swiftness that could never have
        been expected of him, opened his hands, caught the moth, and resumed his
        former attitude.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Before beginning to speak of my business,&rdquo; said Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, following the lawyer&rsquo;s movements with wondering
        eyes, &ldquo;I ought to observe that the business about which I have to
        speak to you is to be strictly private.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The lawyer&rsquo;s overhanging reddish mustaches were parted in a
        scarcely perceptible smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I should not be a lawyer if I could not keep the secrets confided
        to me. But if you would like proof....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at his face, and saw that the shrewd, gray
        eyes were laughing, and seemed to know all about it already.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You know my name?&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch resumed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know you and the good&rdquo;&mdash;again he caught a
        moth&mdash;&ldquo;work you are doing, like every Russian,&rdquo; said
        the lawyer, bowing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed, plucking up his courage. But having once
        made up his mind he went on in his shrill voice, without
        timidity&mdash;or hesitation, accentuating here and there a word.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have the misfortune,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch began,
        &ldquo;to have been deceived in my married life, and I desire to break
        off all relations with my wife by legal means&mdash;that is, to be
        divorced, but to do this so that my son may not remain with his
        mother.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The lawyer&rsquo;s gray eyes tried not to laugh, but they were dancing
        with irrepressible glee, and Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that it was not
        simply the delight of a man who has just got a profitable job: there was
        triumph and joy, there was a gleam like the malignant gleam he saw in
        his wife&rsquo;s eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You desire my assistance in securing a divorce?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, precisely so; but I ought to warn you that I may be wasting
        your time and attention. I have come simply to consult you as a
        preliminary step. I want a divorce, but the form in which it is possible
        is of great consequence to me. It is very possible that if that form
        does not correspond with my requirements I may give up a legal
        divorce.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s always the case,&rdquo; said the lawyer,
        &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s always for you to decide.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He let his eyes rest on Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s feet, feeling that
        he might offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible amusement.
        He looked at a moth that flew before his nose, and moved his hands, but
        did not catch it from regard for Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s position.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Though in their general features our laws on this subject are
        known to me,&rdquo; pursued Alexey Alexandrovitch, &ldquo;I should be
        glad to have an idea of the forms in which such things are done in
        practice.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You would be glad,&rdquo; the lawyer, without lifting his eyes,
        responded, adopting, with a certain satisfaction, the tone of his
        client&rsquo;s remarks, &ldquo;for me to lay before you all the methods
        by which you could secure what you desire?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And on receiving an assuring nod from Alexey Alexandrovitch, he went on,
        stealing a glance now and then at Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s face,
        which was growing red in patches.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Divorce by our laws,&rdquo; he said, with a slight shade of
        disapprobation of our laws, &ldquo;is possible, as you are aware, in the
        following cases.... Wait a little!&rdquo; he called to a clerk who put
        his head in at the door, but he got up all the same, said a few words to
        him, and sat down again. &ldquo;... In the following cases: physical
        defect in the married parties, desertion without communication for five
        years,&rdquo; he said, crooking a short finger covered with hair,
        &ldquo;adultery&rdquo; (this word he pronounced with obvious
        satisfaction), &ldquo;subdivided as follows&rdquo; (he continued to
        crook his fat fingers, though the three cases and their subdivisions
        could obviously not be classified together): &ldquo;physical defect of
        the husband or of the wife, adultery of the husband or of the
        wife.&rdquo; As by now all his fingers were used up, he uncrooked all
        his fingers and went on: &ldquo;This is the theoretical view; but I
        imagine you have done me the honor to apply to me in order to learn its
        application in practice. And therefore, guided by precedents, I must
        inform you that in practice cases of divorce may all be reduced to the
        following&mdash;there&rsquo;s no physical defect, I may assume, nor
        desertion?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed his head in assent.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;&mdash;May be reduced to the following: adultery of one of the
        married parties, and the detection in the fact of the guilty party by
        mutual agreement, and failing such agreement, accidental detection. It
        must be admitted that the latter case is rarely met with in
        practice,&rdquo; said the lawyer, and stealing a glance at Alexey
        Alexandrovitch he paused, as a man selling pistols, after enlarging on
        the advantages of each weapon, might await his customer&rsquo;s choice.
        But Alexey Alexandrovitch said nothing, and therefore the lawyer went
        on: &ldquo;The most usual and simple, the sensible course, I consider,
        is adultery by mutual consent. I should not permit myself to express it
        so, speaking with a man of no education,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I
        imagine that to you this is comprehensible.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch was, however, so perturbed that he did not
        immediately comprehend all the good sense of adultery by mutual consent,
        and his eyes expressed this uncertainty; but the lawyer promptly came to
        his assistance.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;People cannot go on living together&mdash;here you have a fact.
        And if both are agreed about it, the details and formalities become a
        matter of no importance. And at the same time this is the simplest and
        most certain method.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch fully understood now. But he had religious
        scruples, which hindered the execution of such a plan.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That is out of the question in the present case,&rdquo; he said.
        &ldquo;Only one alternative is possible: undesigned detection, supported
        by letters which I have.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At the mention of letters the lawyer pursed up his lips, and gave
        utterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous sound.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kindly consider,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;cases of that kind are,
        as you are aware, under ecclesiastical jurisdiction; the reverend
        fathers are fond of going into the minutest details in cases of that
        kind,&rdquo; he said with a smile, which betrayed his sympathy with the
        reverend fathers&rsquo; taste. &ldquo;Letters may, of course, be a
        partial confirmation; but detection in the fact there must be of the
        most direct kind, that is, by eyewitnesses. In fact, if you do me the
        honor to intrust your confidence to me, you will do well to leave me the
        choice of the measures to be employed. If one wants the result, one must
        admit the means.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If it is so....&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch began, suddenly
        turning white; but at that moment the lawyer rose and again went to the
        door to speak to the intruding clerk.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell her we don&rsquo;t haggle over fees!&rdquo; he said, and
        returned to Alexey Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        On his way back he caught unobserved another moth. &ldquo;Nice state my
        rep curtains will be in by the summer!&rdquo; he thought, frowning.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And so you were saying?...&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I will communicate my decision to you by letter,&rdquo; said
        Alexey Alexandrovitch, getting up, and he clutched at the table. After
        standing a moment in silence, he said: &ldquo;From your words I may
        consequently conclude that a divorce may be obtained? I would ask you to
        let me know what are your terms.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It may be obtained if you give me complete liberty of
        action,&rdquo; said the lawyer, not answering his question. &ldquo;When
        can I reckon on receiving information from you?&rdquo; he asked, moving
        towards the door, his eyes and his varnished boots shining.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In a week&rsquo;s time. Your answer as to whether you will
        undertake to conduct the case, and on what terms, you will be so good as
        to communicate to me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The lawyer bowed respectfully, let his client out of the door, and, left
        alone, gave himself up to his sense of amusement. He felt so mirthful
        that, contrary to his rules, he made a reduction in his terms to the
        haggling lady, and gave up catching moths, finally deciding that next
        winter he must have the furniture covered with velvet, like
        Sigonin&rsquo;s.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 6</h3>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch had gained a brilliant victory at the sitting of
        the Commission of the 17th of August, but in the sequel this victory cut
        the ground from under his feet. The new commission for the inquiry into
        the condition of the native tribes in all its branches had been formed
        and despatched to its destination with an unusual speed and energy
        inspired by Alexey Alexandrovitch. Within three months a report was
        presented. The condition of the native tribes was investigated in its
        political, administrative, economic, ethnographic, material, and
        religious aspects. To all these questions there were answers admirably
        stated, and answers admitting no shade of doubt, since they were not a
        product of human thought, always liable to error, but were all the
        product of official activity. The answers were all based on official
        data furnished by governors and heads of churches, and founded on the
        reports of district magistrates and ecclesiastical superintendents,
        founded in their turn on the reports of parochial overseers and parish
        priests; and so all of these answers were unhesitating and certain. All
        such questions as, for instance, of the cause of failure of crops, of
        the adherence of certain tribes to their ancient beliefs,
        etc.&mdash;questions which, but for the convenient intervention of the
        official machine, are not, and cannot be solved for ages&mdash;received
        full, unhesitating solution. And this solution was in favor of Alexey
        Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s contention. But Stremov, who had felt stung to
        the quick at the last sitting, had, on the reception of the
        commission&rsquo;s report, resorted to tactics which Alexey
        Alexandrovitch had not anticipated. Stremov, carrying with him several
        members, went over to Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s side, and not
        contenting himself with warmly defending the measure proposed by
        Karenin, proposed other more extreme measures in the same direction.
        These measures, still further exaggerated in opposition to what was
        Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s fundamental idea, were passed by the
        commission, and then the aim of Stremov&rsquo;s tactics became apparent.
        Carried to an extreme, the measures seemed at once to be so absurd that
        the highest authorities, and public opinion, and intellectual ladies,
        and the newspapers, all at the same time fell foul of them, expressing
        their indignation both with the measures and their nominal father,
        Alexey Alexandrovitch. Stremov drew back, affecting to have blindly
        followed Karenin, and to be astounded and distressed at what had been
        done. This meant the defeat of Alexey Alexandrovitch. But in spite of
        failing health, in spite of his domestic griefs, he did not give in.
        There was a split in the commission. Some members, with Stremov at their
        head, justified their mistake on the ground that they had put faith in
        the commission of revision, instituted by Alexey Alexandrovitch, and
        maintained that the report of the commission was rubbish, and simply so
        much waste paper. Alexey Alexandrovitch, with a following of those who
        saw the danger of so revolutionary an attitude to official documents,
        persisted in upholding the statements obtained by the revising
        commission. In consequence of this, in the higher spheres, and even in
        society, all was chaos, and although everyone was interested, no one
        could tell whether the native tribes really were becoming impoverished
        and ruined, or whether they were in a flourishing condition. The
        position of Alexey Alexandrovitch, owing to this, and partly owing to
        the contempt lavished on him for his wife&rsquo;s infidelity, became
        very precarious. And in this position he took an important resolution.
        To the astonishment of the commission, he announced that he should ask
        permission to go himself to investigate the question on the spot. And
        having obtained permission, Alexey Alexandrovitch prepared to set off to
        these remote provinces.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s departure made a great sensation, the more
        so as just before he started he officially returned the posting-fares
        allowed him for twelve horses, to drive to his destination.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think it very noble,&rdquo; Betsy said about this to the
        Princess Myakaya. &ldquo;Why take money for posting-horses when everyone
        knows that there are railways everywhere now?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But Princess Myakaya did not agree, and the Princess Tverskaya&rsquo;s
        opinion annoyed her indeed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well for you to talk,&rdquo; said she,
        &ldquo;when you have I don&rsquo;t know how many millions; but I am very
        glad when my husband goes on a revising tour in the summer. It&rsquo;s
        very good for him and pleasant traveling about, and it&rsquo;s a settled
        arrangement for me to keep a carriage and coachman on the money.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        On his way to the remote provinces Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped for
        three days at Moscow.
      </p>

      <p>
        The day after his arrival he was driving back from calling on the
        governor-general. At the crossroads by Gazetoy Place, where there are
        always crowds of carriages and sledges, Alexey Alexandrovitch suddenly
        heard his name called out in such a loud and cheerful voice that he
        could not help looking round. At the corner of the pavement, in a short,
        stylish overcoat and a low-crowned fashionable hat, jauntily askew, with
        a smile that showed a gleam of white teeth and red lips, stood Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, radiant, young, and beaming. He called him vigorously and
        urgently, and insisted on his stopping. He had one arm on the window of
        a carriage that was stopping at the corner, and out of the window were
        thrust the heads of a lady in a velvet hat, and two children. Stepan
        Arkadyevitch was smiling and beckoning to his brother-in-law. The lady
        smiled a kindly smile too, and she too waved her hand to Alexey
        Alexandrovitch. It was Dolly with her children.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch did not want to see anyone in Moscow, and least of
        all his wife&rsquo;s brother. He raised his hat and would have driven
        on, but Stepan Arkadyevitch told his coachman to stop, and ran across
        the snow to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what a shame not to have let us know! Been here long? I was
        at Dussots&rsquo; yesterday and saw &lsquo;Karenin&rsquo; on the
        visitors&rsquo; list, but it never entered my head that it was
        you,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, sticking his head in at the window
        of the carriage, &ldquo;or I should have looked you up. I am glad to see
        you!&rdquo; he said, knocking one foot against the other to shake the
        snow off. &ldquo;What a shame of you not to let us know!&rdquo; he
        repeated.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I had no time; I am very busy,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch
        responded dryly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come to my wife, she does so want to see you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch unfolded the rug in which his frozen feet were
        wrapped, and getting out of his carriage made his way over the snow to
        Darya Alexandrovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, Alexey Alexandrovitch, what are you cutting us like this
        for?&rdquo; said Dolly, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I was very busy. Delighted to see you!&rdquo; he said in a tone
        clearly indicating that he was annoyed by it. &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell me, how is my darling Anna?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch mumbled something and would have gone on. But
        Stepan Arkadyevitch stopped him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you what we&rsquo;ll do tomorrow. Dolly, ask him to
        dinner. We&rsquo;ll ask Koznishev and Pestsov, so as to entertain him
        with our Moscow celebrities.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, please, do come,&rdquo; said Dolly; &ldquo;we will expect
        you at five, or six o&rsquo;clock, if you like. How is my darling Anna?
        How long....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She is quite well,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch mumbled,
        frowning. &ldquo;Delighted!&rdquo; and he moved away towards his
        carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You will come?&rdquo; Dolly called after him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch said something which Dolly could not catch in the
        noise of the moving carriages.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall come round tomorrow!&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch shouted
        to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch got into his carriage, and buried himself in it so
        as neither to see nor be seen.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Queer fish!&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch to his wife, and
        glancing at his watch, he made a motion of his hand before his face,
        indicating a caress to his wife and children, and walked jauntily along
        the pavement.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Stiva! Stiva!&rdquo; Dolly called, reddening.
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned round.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I must get coats, you know, for Grisha and Tanya. Give me the
        money.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Never mind; you tell them I&rsquo;ll pay the bill!&rdquo; and he
        vanished, nodding genially to an acquaintance who drove by.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 7</h3>

      <p>
        The next day was Sunday. Stepan Arkadyevitch went to the Grand Theater
        to a rehearsal of the ballet, and gave Masha Tchibisova, a pretty
        dancing-girl whom he had just taken under his protection, the coral
        necklace he had promised her the evening before, and behind the scenes
        in the dim daylight of the theater, managed to kiss her pretty little
        face, radiant over her present. Besides the gift of the necklace he
        wanted to arrange with her about meeting after the ballet. After
        explaining that he could not come at the beginning of the ballet, he
        promised he would come for the last act and take her to supper. From the
        theater Stepan Arkadyevitch drove to Ohotny Row, selected himself the
        fish and asparagus for dinner, and by twelve o&rsquo;clock was at
        Dussots&rsquo;, where he had to see three people, luckily all staying at
        the same hotel: Levin, who had recently come back from abroad and was
        staying there; the new head of his department, who had just been
        promoted to that position, and had come on a tour of revision to Moscow;
        and his brother-in-law, Karenin, whom he must see, so as to be sure of
        bringing him to dinner.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch liked dining, but still better he liked to give a
        dinner, small, but very choice, both as regards the food and drink and
        as regards the selection of guests. He particularly liked the program of
        that day&rsquo;s dinner. There would be fresh perch, asparagus, and
        <i>la pièce de resistance</i>&mdash;first-rate, but quite plain, roast
        beef, and wines to suit: so much for the eating and drinking. Kitty and
        Levin would be of the party, and that this might not be obtrusively
        evident, there would be a girl cousin too, and young Shtcherbatsky, and
        <i>la pièce de resistance</i> among the guests&mdash;Sergey Koznishev
        and Alexey Alexandrovitch. Sergey Ivanovitch was a Moscow man, and a
        philosopher; Alexey Alexandrovitch a Petersburger, and a practical
        politician. He was asking, too, the well-known eccentric enthusiast,
        Pestsov, a liberal, a great talker, a musician, an historian, and the
        most delightfully youthful person of fifty, who would be a sauce or
        garnish for Koznishev and Karenin. He would provoke them and set them
        off.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second installment for the forest had been received from the
        merchant and was not yet exhausted; Dolly had been very amiable and
        good-humored of late, and the idea of the dinner pleased Stepan
        Arkadyevitch from every point of view. He was in the most light-hearted
        mood. There were two circumstances a little unpleasant, but these two
        circumstances were drowned in the sea of good-humored gaiety which
        flooded the soul of Stepan Arkadyevitch. These two circumstances were:
        first, that on meeting Alexey Alexandrovitch the day before in the
        street he had noticed that he was cold and reserved with him, and
        putting the expression of Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s face and the
        fact that he had not come to see them or let them know of his arrival
        with the rumors he had heard about Anna and Vronsky, Stepan Arkadyevitch
        guessed that something was wrong between the husband and wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        That was one disagreeable thing. The other slightly disagreeable fact
        was that the new head of his department, like all new heads, had the
        reputation already of a terrible person, who got up at six o&rsquo;clock
        in the morning, worked like a horse, and insisted on his subordinates
        working in the same way. Moreover, this new head had the further
        reputation of being a bear in his manners, and was, according to all
        reports, a man of a class in all respects the opposite of that to which
        his predecessor had belonged, and to which Stepan Arkadyevitch had
        hitherto belonged himself. On the previous day Stepan Arkadyevitch had
        appeared at the office in a uniform, and the new chief had been very
        affable and had talked to him as to an acquaintance. Consequently Stepan
        Arkadyevitch deemed it his duty to call upon him in his non-official
        dress. The thought that the new chief might not tender him a warm
        reception was the other unpleasant thing. But Stepan Arkadyevitch
        instinctively felt that everything would <i>come round</i> all right.
        &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all people, all men, like us poor sinners; why be
        nasty and quarrelsome?&rdquo; he thought as he went into the hotel.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Good-day, Vassily,&rdquo; he said, walking into the corridor with
        his hat cocked on one side, and addressing a footman he knew;
        &ldquo;why, you&rsquo;ve let your whiskers grow! Levin, number seven,
        eh? Take me up, please. And find out whether Count Anitchkin&rdquo;
        (this was the new head) &ldquo;is receiving.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Vassily responded, smiling. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
        not been to see us for a long while.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I was here yesterday, but at the other entrance. Is this number
        seven?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin was standing with a peasant from Tver in the middle of the room,
        measuring a fresh bearskin, when Stepan Arkadyevitch went in.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What! you killed him?&rdquo; cried Stepan Arkadyevitch.
        &ldquo;Well done! A she-bear? How are you, Arhip!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He shook hands with the peasant and sat down on the edge of a chair,
        without taking off his coat and hat.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, take off your coat and stay a little,&rdquo; said Levin,
        taking his hat.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t time; I&rsquo;ve only looked in for a tiny
        second,&rdquo; answered Stepan Arkadyevitch. He threw open his coat, but
        afterwards did take it off, and sat on for a whole hour, talking to
        Levin about hunting and the most intimate subjects.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, tell me, please, what you did abroad? Where have you
        been?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, when the peasant had gone.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I stayed in Germany, in Prussia, in France, and in
        England&mdash;not in the capitals, but in the manufacturing towns, and
        saw a great deal that was new to me. And I&rsquo;m glad I went.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I knew your idea of the solution of the labor
        question.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not a bit: in Russia there can be no labor question. In Russia
        the question is that of the relation of the working people to the land;
        though the question exists there too&mdash;but there it&rsquo;s a matter
        of repairing what&rsquo;s been ruined, while with us....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch listened attentively to Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very possible
        you&rsquo;re right. But I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re in good spirits, and
        are hunting bears, and working, and interested. Shtcherbatsky told me
        another story&mdash;he met you&mdash;that you were in such a depressed
        state, talking of nothing but death....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what of it? I&rsquo;ve not given up thinking of
        death,&rdquo; said Levin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that it&rsquo;s high
        time I was dead; and that all this is nonsense. It&rsquo;s the truth
        I&rsquo;m telling you. I do value my idea and my work awfully; but in
        reality only consider this: all this world of ours is nothing but a
        speck of mildew, which has grown up on a tiny planet. And for us to
        suppose we can have something great&mdash;ideas, work&mdash;it&rsquo;s
        all dust and ashes.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But all that&rsquo;s as old as the hills, my boy!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It is old; but do you know, when you grasp this fully, then
        somehow everything becomes of no consequence. When you understand that
        you will die tomorrow, if not today, and nothing will be left, then
        everything is so unimportant! And I consider my idea very important, but
        it turns out really to be as unimportant too, even if it were carried
        out, as doing for that bear. So one goes on living, amusing oneself with
        hunting, with work&mdash;anything so as not to think of death!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled a subtle affectionate smile as he listened to
        Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, of course! Here you&rsquo;ve come round to my point. Do you
        remember you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life? Don&rsquo;t be
        so severe, O moralist!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; all the same, what&rsquo;s fine in life is....&rdquo; Levin
        hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;oh, I don&rsquo;t know. All I know is that we
        shall soon be dead.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so soon?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And do you know, there&rsquo;s less charm in life, when one
        thinks of death, but there&rsquo;s more peace.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;On the contrary, the finish is always the best. But I must be
        going,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up for the tenth time.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, stay a bit!&rdquo; said Levin, keeping him. &ldquo;Now,
        when shall we see each other again? I&rsquo;m going tomorrow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a nice person! Why, that&rsquo;s just what I came for!
        You simply must come to dinner with us today. Your brother&rsquo;s
        coming, and Karenin, my brother-in-law.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say he&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; said Levin,
        and he wanted to inquire about Kitty. He had heard at the beginning of
        the winter that she was at Petersburg with her sister, the wife of the
        diplomat, and he did not know whether she had come back or not; but he
        changed his mind and did not ask. &ldquo;Whether she&rsquo;s coming or
        not, I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; he said to himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll come?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;At five o&rsquo;clock, then, and not evening dress.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and went down below to the new head of
        his department. Instinct had not misled Stepan Arkadyevitch. The
        terrible new head turned out to be an extremely amenable person, and
        Stepan Arkadyevitch lunched with him and stayed on, so that it was four
        o&rsquo;clock before he got to Alexey Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 8</h3>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch, on coming back from church service, had spent the
        whole morning indoors. He had two pieces of business before him that
        morning; first, to receive and send on a deputation from the native
        tribes which was on its way to Petersburg, and now at Moscow; secondly,
        to write the promised letter to the lawyer. The deputation, though it
        had been summoned at Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s instigation, was not
        without its discomforting and even dangerous aspect, and he was glad he
        had found it in Moscow. The members of this deputation had not the
        slightest conception of their duty and the part they were to play. They
        naïvely believed that it was their business to lay before the commission
        their needs and the actual condition of things, and to ask assistance of
        the government, and utterly failed to grasp that some of their
        statements and requests supported the contention of the enemy&rsquo;s
        side, and so spoiled the whole business. Alexey Alexandrovitch was
        busily engaged with them for a long while, drew up a program for them
        from which they were not to depart, and on dismissing them wrote a
        letter to Petersburg for the guidance of the deputation. He had his
        chief support in this affair in the Countess Lidia Ivanovna. She was a
        specialist in the matter of deputations, and no one knew better than she
        how to manage them, and put them in the way they should go. Having
        completed this task, Alexey Alexandrovitch wrote the letter to the
        lawyer. Without the slightest hesitation he gave him permission to act
        as he might judge best. In the letter he enclosed three of
        Vronsky&rsquo;s notes to Anna, which were in the portfolio he had taken
        away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since Alexey Alexandrovitch had left home with the intention of not
        returning to his family again, and since he had been at the
        lawyer&rsquo;s and had spoken, though only to one man, of his intention,
        since especially he had translated the matter from the world of real
        life to the world of ink and paper, he had grown more and more used to
        his own intention, and by now distinctly perceived the feasibility of
        its execution.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was sealing the envelope to the lawyer, when he heard the loud tones
        of Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s voice. Stepan Arkadyevitch was disputing
        with Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s servant, and insisting on being
        announced.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; thought Alexey Alexandrovitch, &ldquo;so much
        the better. I will inform him at once of my position in regard to his
        sister, and explain why it is I can&rsquo;t dine with him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; he said aloud, collecting his papers, and putting
        them in the blotting-paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There, you see, you&rsquo;re talking nonsense, and he&rsquo;s at
        home!&rdquo; responded Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s voice, addressing the
        servant, who had refused to let him in, and taking off his coat as he
        went, Oblonsky walked into the room. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m awfully glad
        I&rsquo;ve found you! So I hope....&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch began
        cheerfully.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot come,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch said coldly, standing
        and not asking his visitor to sit down.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought to pass at once into those frigid
        relations in which he ought to stand with the brother of a wife against
        whom he was beginning a suit for divorce. But he had not taken into
        account the ocean of kindliness brimming over in the heart of Stepan
        Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch opened wide his clear, shining eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you? What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked in
        perplexity, speaking in French. &ldquo;Oh, but it&rsquo;s a promise. And
        we&rsquo;re all counting on you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I want to tell you that I can&rsquo;t dine at your house, because
        the terms of relationship which have existed between us must
        cease.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How? How do you mean? What for?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch
        with a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Because I am beginning an action for divorce against your sister,
        my wife. I ought to have....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But, before Alexey Alexandrovitch had time to finish his sentence,
        Stepan Arkadyevitch was behaving not at all as he had expected. He
        groaned and sank into an armchair.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, Alexey Alexandrovitch! What are you saying?&rdquo; cried
        Oblonsky, and his suffering was apparent in his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It is so.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down, feeling that his words had not had the
        effect he anticipated, and that it would be unavoidable for him to
        explain his position, and that, whatever explanations he might make, his
        relations with his brother-in-law would remain unchanged.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I am brought to the painful necessity of seeking a
        divorce,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I will say one thing, Alexey Alexandrovitch. I know you for an
        excellent, upright man; I know Anna&mdash;excuse me, I can&rsquo;t
        change my opinion of her&mdash;for a good, an excellent woman; and so,
        excuse me, I cannot believe it. There is some misunderstanding,&rdquo;
        said he.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, if it were merely a misunderstanding!...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Pardon, I understand,&rdquo; interposed Stepan Arkadyevitch.
        &ldquo;But of course.... One thing: you must not act in haste. You must
        not, you must not act in haste!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am not acting in haste,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch said
        coldly, &ldquo;but one cannot ask advice of anyone in such a matter. I
        have quite made up my mind.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This is awful!&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;I would do
        one thing, Alexey Alexandrovitch. I beseech you, do it!&rdquo; he said.
        &ldquo;No action has yet been taken, if I understand rightly. Before you
        take advice, see my wife, talk to her. She loves Anna like a sister, she
        loves you, and she&rsquo;s a wonderful woman. For God&rsquo;s sake, talk
        to her! Do me that favor, I beseech you!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered, and Stepan Arkadyevitch looked at him
        sympathetically, without interrupting his silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You will go to see her?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. That was just why I have not been to see you.
        I imagine our relations must change.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so? I don&rsquo;t see that. Allow me to believe that apart
        from our connection you have for me, at least in part, the same friendly
        feeling I have always had for you ... and sincere esteem,&rdquo; said
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, pressing his hand. &ldquo;Even if your worst
        suppositions were correct, I don&rsquo;t&mdash;and never
        would&mdash;take on myself to judge either side, and I see no reason why
        our relations should be affected. But now, do this, come and see my
        wife.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, we look at the matter differently,&rdquo; said Alexey
        Alexandrovitch coldly. &ldquo;However, we won&rsquo;t discuss it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; why shouldn&rsquo;t you come today to dine, anyway? My
        wife&rsquo;s expecting you. Please, do come. And, above all, talk it
        over with her. She&rsquo;s a wonderful woman. For God&rsquo;s sake, on
        my knees, I implore you!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you so much wish it, I will come,&rdquo; said Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, sighing.
      </p>

      <p>
        And, anxious to change the conversation, he inquired about what
        interested them both&mdash;the new head of Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s
        department, a man not yet old, who had suddenly been promoted to so high
        a position.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch had previously felt no liking for Count Anitchkin,
        and had always differed from him in his opinions. But now, from a
        feeling readily comprehensible to officials&mdash;that hatred felt by
        one who has suffered a defeat in the service for one who has received a
        promotion, he could not endure him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, have you seen him?&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch with a
        malignant smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course; he was at our sitting yesterday. He seems to know his
        work capitally, and to be very energetic.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but what is his energy directed to?&rdquo; said Alexey
        Alexandrovitch. &ldquo;Is he aiming at doing anything, or simply undoing
        what&rsquo;s been done? It&rsquo;s the great misfortune of our
        government&mdash;this paper administration, of which he&rsquo;s a worthy
        representative.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t know what fault one could find with him.
        His policy I don&rsquo;t know, but one thing&mdash;he&rsquo;s a very
        nice fellow,&rdquo; answered Stepan Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just
        been seeing him, and he&rsquo;s really a capital fellow. We lunched
        together, and I taught him how to make, you know that drink, wine and
        oranges. It&rsquo;s so cooling. And it&rsquo;s a wonder he didn&rsquo;t
        know it. He liked it awfully. No, really he&rsquo;s a capital
        fellow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch glanced at his watch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, good heavens, it&rsquo;s four already, and I&rsquo;ve still
        to go to Dolgovushin&rsquo;s! So please come round to dinner. You
        can&rsquo;t imagine how you will grieve my wife and me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The way in which Alexey Alexandrovitch saw his brother-in-law out was
        very different from the manner in which he had met him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve promised, and I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; he answered
        wearily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Believe me, I appreciate it, and I hope you won&rsquo;t regret
        it,&rdquo; answered Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        And, putting on his coat as he went, he patted the footman on the head,
        chuckled, and went out.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;At five o&rsquo;clock, and not evening dress, please,&rdquo; he
        shouted once more, turning at the door.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 9</h3>

        It was past five, and several guests had already arrived, before the
        host himself got home. He went in together with Sergey Ivanovitch
        Koznishev and Pestsov, who had reached the street door at the same
        moment. These were the two leading representatives of the Moscow
        intellectuals, as Oblonsky had called them. Both were men respected for
        their character and their intelligence. They respected each other, but
        were in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject,
        not because they belonged to opposite parties, but precisely because
        they were of the same party (their enemies refused to see any
        distinction between their views); but, in that party, each had his own
        special shade of opinion. And since no difference is less easily
        overcome than the difference of opinion about semi-abstract questions,
        they never agreed in any opinion, and had long, indeed, been accustomed
        to jeer without anger, each at the other&rsquo;s incorrigible
        aberrations.
      </p>

      <p>
        They were just going in at the door, talking of the weather, when Stepan
        Arkadyevitch overtook them. In the drawing-room there were already
        sitting Prince Alexander Dmitrievitch Shtcherbatsky, young
        Shtcherbatsky, Turovtsin, Kitty, and Karenin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch saw immediately that things were not going well in
        the drawing-room without him. Darya Alexandrovna, in her best gray silk
        gown, obviously worried about the children, who were to have their
        dinner by themselves in the nursery, and by her husband&rsquo;s absence,
        was not equal to the task of making the party mix without him. All were
        sitting like so many priests&rsquo; wives on a visit (so the old prince
        expressed it), obviously wondering why they were there, and pumping up
        remarks simply to avoid being silent. Turovtsin&mdash;good, simple
        man&mdash;felt unmistakably a fish out of water, and the smile with
        which his thick lips greeted Stepan Arkadyevitch said, as plainly as
        words: &ldquo;Well, old boy, you have popped me down in a learned set! A
        drinking party now, or the <i>Château des Fleurs</i>, would be more in
        my line!&rdquo; The old prince sat in silence, his bright little eyes
        watching Karenin from one side, and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw that he had
        already formed a phrase to sum up that politician of whom guests were
        invited to partake as though he were a sturgeon. Kitty was looking at
        the door, calling up all her energies to keep her from blushing at the
        entrance of Konstantin Levin. Young Shtcherbatsky, who had not been
        introduced to Karenin, was trying to look as though he were not in the
        least conscious of it. Karenin himself had followed the Petersburg
        fashion for a dinner with ladies and was wearing evening dress and a
        white tie. Stepan Arkadyevitch saw by his face that he had come simply
        to keep his promise, and was performing a disagreeable duty in being
        present at this gathering. He was indeed the person chiefly responsible
        for the chill benumbing all the guests before Stepan Arkadyevitch came
        in.
      </p>

      <p>
        On entering the drawing-room Stepan Arkadyevitch apologized, explaining
        that he had been detained by that prince, who was always the scapegoat
        for all his absences and unpunctualities, and in one moment he had made
        all the guests acquainted with each other, and, bringing together Alexey
        Alexandrovitch and Sergey Koznishev, started them on a discussion of the
        Russification of Poland, into which they immediately plunged with
        Pestsov. Slapping Turovtsin on the shoulder, he whispered something
        comic in his ear, and set him down by his wife and the old prince. Then
        he told Kitty she was looking very pretty that evening, and presented
        Shtcherbatsky to Karenin. In a moment he had so kneaded together the
        social dough that the drawing-room became very lively, and there was a
        merry buzz of voices. Konstantin Levin was the only person who had not
        arrived. But this was so much the better, as going into the dining-room,
        Stepan Arkadyevitch found to his horror that the port and sherry had
        been procured from Depré, and not from Levy, and, directing that the
        coachman should be sent off as speedily as possible to Levy&rsquo;s, he
        was going back to the drawing-room.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the dining-room he was met by Konstantin Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not late?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You can never help being late!&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        taking his arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you a lot of people? Who&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; asked Levin,
        unable to help blushing, as he knocked the snow off his cap with his
        glove.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All our own set. Kitty&rsquo;s here. Come along, I&rsquo;ll
        introduce you to Karenin.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, for all his liberal views, was well aware that to
        meet Karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction, and so
        treated his best friends to this honor. But at that instant Konstantin
        Levin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making
        such an acquaintance. He had not seen Kitty since that memorable evening
        when he met Vronsky, not counting, that is, the moment when he had had a
        glimpse of her on the highroad. He had known at the bottom of his heart
        that he would see her here today. But to keep his thoughts free, he had
        tried to persuade himself that he did not know it. Now when he heard
        that she was here, he was suddenly conscious of such delight, and at the
        same time of such dread, that his breath failed him and he could not
        utter what he wanted to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is she like, what is she like? Like what she used to be, or
        like what she was in the carriage? What if Darya Alexandrovna told the
        truth? Why shouldn&rsquo;t it be the truth?&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, please, introduce me to Karenin,&rdquo; he brought out with
        an effort, and with a desperately determined step he walked into the
        drawing-room and beheld her.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was not the same as she used to be, nor was she as she had been in
        the carriage; she was quite different.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was scared, shy, shame-faced, and still more charming from it. She
        saw him the very instant he walked into the room. She had been expecting
        him. She was delighted, and so confused at her own delight that there
        was a moment, the moment when he went up to her sister and glanced again
        at her, when she, and he, and Dolly, who saw it all, thought she would
        break down and would begin to cry. She crimsoned, turned white,
        crimsoned again, and grew faint, waiting with quivering lips for him to
        come to her. He went up to her, bowed, and held out his hand without
        speaking. Except for the slight quiver of her lips and the moisture in
        her eyes that made them brighter, her smile was almost calm as she said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How long it is since we&rsquo;ve seen each other!&rdquo; and with
        desperate determination she pressed his hand with her cold hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not seen me, but I&rsquo;ve seen you,&rdquo; said
        Levin, with a radiant smile of happiness. &ldquo;I saw you when you were
        driving from the railway station to Ergushovo.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;When?&rdquo; she asked, wondering.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You were driving to Ergushovo,&rdquo; said Levin, feeling as if
        he would sob with the rapture that was flooding his heart. &ldquo;And
        how dared I associate a thought of anything not innocent with this
        touching creature? And, yes, I do believe it&rsquo;s true what Darya
        Alexandrovna told me,&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch took him by the arm and led him away to Karenin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let me introduce you.&rdquo; He mentioned their names.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very glad to meet you again,&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch
        coldly, shaking hands with Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are acquainted?&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch asked in surprise.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We spent three hours together in the train,&rdquo; said Levin
        smiling, &ldquo;but got out, just as in a masquerade, quite
        mystified&mdash;at least I was.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nonsense! Come along, please,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        pointing in the direction of the dining-room.
      </p>

      <p>
        The men went into the dining-room and went up to a table, laid with six
        sorts of spirits and as many kinds of cheese, some with little silver
        spades and some without, caviar, herrings, preserves of various kinds,
        and plates with slices of French bread.
      </p>

      <p>
        The men stood round the strong-smelling spirits and salt delicacies, and
        the discussion of the Russification of Poland between Koznishev,
        Karenin, and Pestsov died down in anticipation of dinner.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch was unequaled in his skill in winding up the most
        heated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of Attic salt that
        changed the disposition of his opponent. He did this now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch had been maintaining that the Russification of
        Poland could only be accomplished as a result of larger measures which
        ought to be introduced by the Russian government.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pestsov insisted that one country can only absorb another when it is the
        more densely populated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Koznishev admitted both points, but with limitations. As they were going
        out of the drawing-room to conclude the argument, Koznishev said,
        smiling:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So, then, for the Russification of our foreign populations there
        is but one method&mdash;to bring up as many children as one can. My
        brother and I are terribly in fault, I see. You married men, especially
        you, Stepan Arkadyevitch, are the real patriots: what number have you
        reached?&rdquo; he said, smiling genially at their host and holding out
        a tiny wine-glass to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone laughed, and Stepan Arkadyevitch with particular good humor.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, that&rsquo;s the best method!&rdquo; he said, munching
        cheese and filling the wine-glass with a special sort of spirit. The
        conversation dropped at the jest.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This cheese is not bad. Shall I give you some?&rdquo; said the
        master of the house. &ldquo;Why, have you been going in for gymnastics
        again?&rdquo; he asked Levin, pinching his muscle with his left hand.
        Levin smiled, bent his arm, and under Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s
        fingers the muscles swelled up like a sound cheese, hard as a knob of
        iron, through the fine cloth of the coat.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What biceps! A perfect Samson!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears,&rdquo;
        observed Alexey Alexandrovitch, who had the mistiest notions about the
        chase. He cut off and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a
        spider-web.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not at all. Quite the contrary; a child can kill a bear,&rdquo;
        he said, with a slight bow moving aside for the ladies, who were
        approaching the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You have killed a bear, I&rsquo;ve been told!&rdquo; said Kitty,
        trying assiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would
        slip away, and setting the lace quivering over her white arm. &ldquo;Are
        there bears on your place?&rdquo; she added, turning her charming little
        head to him and smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said, but what
        unutterable meaning there was for him in every sound, in every turn of
        her lips, her eyes, her hand as she said it! There was entreaty for
        forgiveness, and trust in him, and tenderness&mdash;soft, timid
        tenderness&mdash;and promise and hope and love for him, which he could
        not but believe in and which choked him with happiness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ve been hunting in the Tver province. It was coming
        back from there that I met your <i>beau-frère</i> in the train, or your
        <i>beau-frère&rsquo;s</i> brother-in-law,&rdquo; he said with a smile.
        &ldquo;It was an amusing meeting.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he began telling with droll good-humor how, after not sleeping all
        night, he had, wearing an old fur-lined, full-skirted coat, got into
        Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s compartment.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The conductor, forgetting the proverb, would have chucked me out
        on account of my attire; but thereupon I began expressing my feelings in
        elevated language, and ... you, too,&rdquo; he said, addressing Karenin
        and forgetting his name, &ldquo;at first would have ejected me on the
        ground of the old coat, but afterwards you took my part, for which I am
        extremely grateful.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are too
        ill-defined,&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch, rubbing the tips of his
        fingers on his handkerchief.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I saw you were in uncertainty about me,&rdquo; said Levin,
        smiling good-naturedly, &ldquo;but I made haste to plunge into
        intellectual conversation to smooth over the defects of my
        attire.&rdquo; Sergey Ivanovitch, while he kept up a conversation with
        their hostess, had one ear for his brother, and he glanced askance at
        him. &ldquo;What is the matter with him today? Why such a conquering
        hero?&rdquo; he thought. He did not know that Levin was feeling as
        though he had grown wings. Levin knew she was listening to his words and
        that she was glad to listen to him. And this was the only thing that
        interested him. Not in that room only, but in the whole world, there
        existed for him only himself, with enormously increased importance and
        dignity in his own eyes, and she. He felt himself on a pinnacle that
        made him giddy, and far away down below were all those nice excellent
        Karenins, Oblonskys, and all the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quite without attracting notice, without glancing at them, as though
        there were no other places left, Stepan Arkadyevitch put Levin and Kitty
        side by side.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, you may as well sit there,&rdquo; he said to Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dinner was as choice as the china, in which Stepan Arkadyevitch was
        a connoisseur. The <i>soupe Marie-Louise</i> was a splendid success; the
        tiny pies eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable. The
        two footmen and Matvey, in white cravats, did their duty with the dishes
        and wines unobtrusively, quietly, and swiftly. On the material side the
        dinner was a success; it was no less so on the immaterial. The
        conversation, at times general and at times between individuals, never
        paused, and towards the end the company was so lively that the men rose
        from the table, without stopping speaking, and even Alexey
        Alexandrovitch thawed.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 10</h3>

      <p>
        Pestsov liked thrashing an argument out to the end, and was not
        satisfied with Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s words, especially as he felt
        the injustice of his view.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I did not mean,&rdquo; he said over the soup, addressing Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, &ldquo;mere density of population alone, but in
        conjunction with fundamental ideas, and not by means of
        principles.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch said languidly, and
        with no haste, &ldquo;that that&rsquo;s the same thing. In my opinion,
        influence over another people is only possible to the people which has
        the higher development, which....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just the question,&rdquo; Pestsov broke in in
        his bass. He was always in a hurry to speak, and seemed always to put
        his whole soul into what he was saying. &ldquo;In what are we to make
        higher development consist? The English, the French, the Germans, which
        is at the highest stage of development? Which of them will nationalize
        the other? We see the Rhine provinces have been turned French, but the
        Germans are not at a lower stage!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;There is
        another law at work there.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of true
        civilization,&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch, slightly lifting his
        eyebrows.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true
        civilization?&rdquo; said Pestsov.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I imagine such signs are generally very well known,&rdquo; said
        Alexey Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But are they fully known?&rdquo; Sergey Ivanovitch put in with a
        subtle smile. &ldquo;It is the accepted view now that real culture must
        be purely classical; but we see most intense disputes on each side of
        the question, and there is no denying that the opposite camp has strong
        points in its favor.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are for classics, Sergey Ivanovitch. Will you take red
        wine?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am not expressing my own opinion of either form of
        culture,&rdquo; Sergey Ivanovitch said, holding out his glass with a
        smile of condescension, as to a child. &ldquo;I only say that both sides
        have strong arguments to support them,&rdquo; he went on, addressing
        Alexey Alexandrovitch. &ldquo;My sympathies are classical from
        education, but in this discussion I am personally unable to arrive at a
        conclusion. I see no distinct grounds for classical studies being given
        a preeminence over scientific studies.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The natural sciences have just as great an educational
        value,&rdquo; put in Pestsov. &ldquo;Take astronomy, take botany, or
        zoology with its system of general principles.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot quite agree with that,&rdquo; responded Alexey
        Alexandrovitch &ldquo;It seems to me that one must admit that the very
        process of studying the forms of language has a peculiarly favorable
        influence on intellectual development. Moreover, it cannot be denied
        that the influence of the classical authors is in the highest degree
        moral, while, unfortunately, with the study of the natural sciences are
        associated the false and noxious doctrines which are the curse of our
        day.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch would have said something, but Pestsov interrupted him
        in his rich bass. He began warmly contesting the justice of this view.
        Sergey Ivanovitch waited serenely to speak, obviously with a convincing
        reply ready.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling subtly, and
        addressing Karenin, &ldquo;One must allow that to weigh all the
        advantages and disadvantages of classical and scientific studies is a
        difficult task, and the question which form of education was to be
        preferred would not have been so quickly and conclusively decided if
        there had not been in favor of classical education, as you expressed it
        just now, its moral&mdash;<i>disons le mot</i>&mdash;anti-nihilist
        influence.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If it had not been for the distinctive property of
        anti-nihilistic influence on the side of classical studies, we should
        have considered the subject more, have weighed the arguments on both
        sides,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch with a subtle smile, &ldquo;we
        should have given elbow-room to both tendencies. But now we know that
        these little pills of classical learning possess the medicinal property
        of anti-nihilism, and we boldly prescribe them to our patients.... But
        what if they had no such medicinal property?&rdquo; he wound up
        humorously.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s little pills, everyone laughed; Turovtsin
        in especial roared loudly and jovially, glad at last to have found
        something to laugh at, all he ever looked for in listening to
        conversation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch had not made a mistake in inviting Pestsov. With
        Pestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant. Directly
        Sergey Ivanovitch had concluded the conversation with his jest, Pestsov
        promptly started a new one.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t agree even,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that the
        government had that aim. The government obviously is guided by abstract
        considerations, and remains indifferent to the influence its measures
        may exercise. The education of women, for instance, would naturally be
        regarded as likely to be harmful, but the government opens schools and
        universities for women.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education
        of women.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch expressed the idea that the education of women is
        apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women, and that it is only
        so that it can be considered dangerous.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I consider, on the contrary, that the two questions are
        inseparably connected together,&rdquo; said Pestsov; &ldquo;it is a
        vicious circle. Woman is deprived of rights from lack of education, and
        the lack of education results from the absence of rights. We must not
        forget that the subjection of women is so complete, and dates from such
        ages back that we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that
        separates them from us,&rdquo; said he.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You said rights,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till
        Pestsov had finished, &ldquo;meaning the right of sitting on juries, of
        voting, of presiding at official meetings, the right of entering the
        civil service, of sitting in parliament....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But if women, as a rare exception, can occupy such positions, it
        seems to me you are wrong in using the expression &lsquo;rights.&rsquo;
        It would be more correct to say duties. Every man will agree that in
        doing the duty of a juryman, a witness, a telegraph clerk, we feel we
        are performing duties. And therefore it would be correct to say that
        women are seeking duties, and quite legitimately. And one can but
        sympathize with this desire to assist in the general labor of
        man.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch assented. &ldquo;The
        question, I imagine, is simply whether they are fitted for such
        duties.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They will most likely be perfectly fitted,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, &ldquo;when education has become general among them. We
        see this....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How about the proverb?&rdquo; said the prince, who had a long
        while been intent on the conversation, his little comical eyes
        twinkling. &ldquo;I can say it before my daughter: her hair is long,
        because her wit is....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Just what they thought of the negroes before their
        emancipation!&rdquo; said Pestsov angrily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh
        duties,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch, &ldquo;while we see, unhappily,
        that men usually try to avoid them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Duties are bound up with rights&mdash;power, money, honor; those
        are what women are seeking,&rdquo; said Pestsov.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Just as though I should seek the right to be a wet-nurse and feel
        injured because women are paid for the work, while no one will take
        me,&rdquo; said the old prince.
      </p>

      <p>
        Turovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter and Sergey Ivanovitch
        regretted that he had not made this comparison. Even Alexey
        Alexandrovitch smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but a man can&rsquo;t nurse a baby,&rdquo; said Pestsov,
        &ldquo;while a woman....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, there was an Englishman who did suckle his baby on board
        ship,&rdquo; said the old prince, feeling this freedom in conversation
        permissible before his own daughters.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There are as many such Englishmen as there would be women
        officials,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but what is a girl to do who has no family?&rdquo; put in
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, thinking of Masha Tchibisova, whom he had had in
        his mind all along, in sympathizing with Pestsov and supporting him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted, you would
        find she had abandoned a family&mdash;her own or a sister&rsquo;s, where
        she might have found a woman&rsquo;s duties,&rdquo; Darya Alexandrovna
        broke in unexpectedly in a tone of exasperation, probably suspecting
        what sort of girl Stepan Arkadyevitch was thinking of.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But we take our stand on principle as the ideal,&rdquo; replied
        Pestsov in his mellow bass. &ldquo;Woman desires to have rights, to be
        independent, educated. She is oppressed, humiliated by the consciousness
        of her disabilities.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m oppressed and humiliated that they won&rsquo;t
        engage me at the Foundling,&rdquo; the old prince said again, to the
        huge delight of Turovtsin, who in his mirth dropped his asparagus with
        the thick end in the sauce.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 11</h3>

      <p>
        Everyone took part in the conversation except Kitty and Levin. At first,
        when they were talking of the influence that one people has on another,
        there rose to Levin&rsquo;s mind what he had to say on the subject. But
        these ideas, once of such importance in his eyes, seemed to come into
        his brain as in a dream, and had now not the slightest interest for him.
        It even struck him as strange that they should be so eager to talk of
        what was of no use to anyone. Kitty, too, should, one would have
        supposed, have been interested in what they were saying of the rights
        and education of women. How often she had mused on the subject, thinking
        of her friend abroad, Varenka, of her painful state of dependence, how
        often she had wondered about herself what would become of her if she did
        not marry, and how often she had argued with her sister about it! But it
        did not interest her at all. She and Levin had a conversation of their
        own, yet not a conversation, but some sort of mysterious communication,
        which brought them every moment nearer, and stirred in both a sense of
        glad terror before the unknown into which they were entering.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first Levin, in answer to Kitty&rsquo;s question how he could have
        seen her last year in the carriage, told her how he had been coming home
        from the mowing along the highroad and had met her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It was very, very early in the morning. You were probably only
        just awake. Your mother was asleep in the corner. It was an exquisite
        morning. I was walking along wondering who it could be in a
        four-in-hand? It was a splendid set of four horses with bells, and in a
        second you flashed by, and I saw you at the window&mdash;you were
        sitting like this, holding the strings of your cap in both hands, and
        thinking awfully deeply about something,&rdquo; he said, smiling.
        &ldquo;How I should like to know what you were thinking about then!
        Something important?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t I dreadfully untidy?&rdquo; she wondered, but seeing
        the smile of ecstasy these reminiscences called up, she felt that the
        impression she had made had been very good. She blushed and laughed with
        delight; &ldquo;Really I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How nicely Turovtsin laughs!&rdquo; said Levin, admiring his
        moist eyes and shaking chest.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you known him long?&rdquo; asked Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, everyone knows him!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And I see you think he&rsquo;s a horrid man?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not horrid, but nothing in him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re wrong! And you must give up thinking so
        directly!&rdquo; said Kitty. &ldquo;I used to have a very poor opinion
        of him too, but he, he&rsquo;s an awfully nice and wonderfully
        good-hearted man. He has a heart of gold.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How could you find out what sort of heart he has?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We are great friends. I know him very well. Last winter, soon
        after ... you came to see us,&rdquo; she said, with a guilty and at the
        same time confiding smile, &ldquo;all Dolly&rsquo;s children had scarlet
        fever, and he happened to come and see her. And only fancy,&rdquo; she
        said in a whisper, &ldquo;he felt so sorry for her that he stayed and
        began to help her look after the children. Yes, and for three weeks he
        stopped with them, and looked after the children like a nurse.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am telling Konstantin Dmitrievitch about Turovtsin in the
        scarlet fever,&rdquo; she said, bending over to her sister.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it was wonderful, noble!&rdquo; said Dolly, glancing towards
        Turovtsin, who had become aware they were talking of him, and smiling
        gently to him. Levin glanced once more at Turovtsin, and wondered how it
        was he had not realized all this man&rsquo;s goodness before.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry, and I&rsquo;ll never think ill
        of people again!&rdquo; he said gaily, genuinely expressing what he felt
        at the moment.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 12</h3>

      <p>
        Connected with the conversation that had sprung up on the rights of
        women there were certain questions as to the inequality of rights in
        marriage improper to discuss before the ladies. Pestsov had several
        times during dinner touched upon these questions, but Sergey Ivanovitch
        and Stepan Arkadyevitch carefully drew him off them.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out, Pestsov did
        not follow them, but addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch, began to expound
        the chief ground of inequality. The inequality in marriage, in his
        opinion, lay in the fact that the infidelity of the wife and the
        infidelity of the husband are punished unequally, both by the law and by
        public opinion. Stepan Arkadyevitch went hurriedly up to Alexey
        Alexandrovitch and offered him a cigar.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t smoke,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch answered
        calmly, and as though purposely wishing to show that he was not afraid
        of the subject, he turned to Pestsov with a chilly smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I imagine that such a view has a foundation in the very nature of
        things,&rdquo; he said, and would have gone on to the drawing-room. But
        at this point Turovtsin broke suddenly and unexpectedly into the
        conversation, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You heard, perhaps, about Pryatchnikov?&rdquo; said Turovtsin,
        warmed up by the champagne he had drunk, and long waiting for an
        opportunity to break the silence that had weighed on him. &ldquo;Vasya
        Pryatchnikov,&rdquo; he said, with a good-natured smile on his damp, red
        lips, addressing himself principally to the most important guest, Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, &ldquo;they told me today he fought a duel with Kvitsky
        at Tver, and has killed him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as it always seems that one bruises oneself on a sore place, so
        Stepan Arkadyevitch felt now that the conversation would by ill luck
        fall every moment on Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s sore spot. He would
        again have got his brother-in-law away, but Alexey Alexandrovitch
        himself inquired, with curiosity:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What did Pryatchnikov fight about?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;His wife. Acted like a man, he did! Called him out and shot
        him!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch indifferently, and lifting
        his eyebrows, he went into the drawing-room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How glad I am you have come,&rdquo; Dolly said with a frightened
        smile, meeting him in the outer drawing-room. &ldquo;I must talk to you.
        Let&rsquo;s sit here.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch, with the same expression of indifference, given
        him by his lifted eyebrows, sat down beside Darya Alexandrovna, and
        smiled affectedly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fortunate,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;especially as I was
        meaning to ask you to excuse me, and to be taking leave. I have to start
        tomorrow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna was firmly convinced of Anna&rsquo;s innocence, and
        she felt herself growing pale and her lips quivering with anger at this
        frigid, unfeeling man, who was so calmly intending to ruin her innocent
        friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey Alexandrovitch,&rdquo; she said, with desperate resolution
        looking him in the face, &ldquo;I asked you about Anna, you made me no
        answer. How is she?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She is, I believe, quite well, Darya Alexandrovna,&rdquo; replied
        Alexey Alexandrovitch, not looking at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey Alexandrovitch, forgive me, I have no right ... but I love
        Anna as a sister, and esteem her; I beg, I beseech you to tell me what
        is wrong between you? what fault do you find with her?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch frowned, and almost closing his eyes, dropped his
        head.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I presume that your husband has told you the grounds on which I
        consider it necessary to change my attitude to Anna Arkadyevna?&rdquo;
        he said, not looking her in the face, but eyeing with displeasure
        Shtcherbatsky, who was walking across the drawing-room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it, I don&rsquo;t believe it, I can&rsquo;t
        believe it!&rdquo; Dolly said, clasping her bony hands before her with a
        vigorous gesture. She rose quickly, and laid her hand on Alexey
        Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;We shall be disturbed here. Come
        this way, please.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly&rsquo;s agitation had an effect on Alexey Alexandrovitch. He got
        up and submissively followed her to the schoolroom. They sat down to a
        table covered with an oilcloth cut in slits by penknives.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; Dolly said,
        trying to catch his glance that avoided her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;One cannot disbelieve facts, Darya Alexandrovna,&rdquo; said he,
        with an emphasis on the word &ldquo;facts.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what has she done?&rdquo; said Darya Alexandrovna.
        &ldquo;What precisely has she done?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She has forsaken her duty, and deceived her husband. That&rsquo;s
        what she has done,&rdquo; said he.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no, it can&rsquo;t be! No, for God&rsquo;s sake, you are
        mistaken,&rdquo; said Dolly, putting her hands to her temples and
        closing her eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled coldly, with his lips alone, meaning to
        signify to her and to himself the firmness of his conviction; but this
        warm defense, though it could not shake him, reopened his wound. He
        began to speak with greater heat.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It is extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself
        informs her husband of the fact&mdash;informs him that eight years of
        her life, and a son, all that&rsquo;s a mistake, and that she wants to
        begin life again,&rdquo; he said angrily, with a snort.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna and sin&mdash;I cannot connect them, I cannot believe
        it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Darya Alexandrovna,&rdquo; he said, now looking straight into
        Dolly&rsquo;s kindly, troubled face, and feeling that his tongue was
        being loosened in spite of himself, &ldquo;I would give a great deal for
        doubt to be still possible. When I doubted, I was miserable, but it was
        better than now. When I doubted, I had hope; but now there is no hope,
        and still I doubt of everything. I am in such doubt of everything that I
        even hate my son, and sometimes do not believe he is my son. I am very
        unhappy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He had no need to say that. Darya Alexandrovna had seen that as soon as
        he glanced into her face; and she felt sorry for him, and her faith in
        the innocence of her friend began to totter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, this is awful, awful! But can it be true that you are
        resolved on a divorce?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am resolved on extreme measures. There is nothing else for me
        to do.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing else to do, nothing else to do....&rdquo; she replied,
        with tears in her eyes. &ldquo;Oh no, don&rsquo;t say nothing else to
        do!&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is horrible in a trouble of this kind is that one cannot, as
        in any other&mdash;in loss, in death&mdash;bear one&rsquo;s trouble in
        peace, but that one must act,&rdquo; said he, as though guessing her
        thought. &ldquo;One must get out of the humiliating position in which
        one is placed; one can&rsquo;t live <i>à trois</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I understand, I quite understand that,&rdquo; said Dolly, and her
        head sank. She was silent for a little, thinking of herself, of her own
        grief in her family, and all at once, with an impulsive movement, she
        raised her head and clasped her hands with an imploring gesture.
        &ldquo;But wait a little! You are a Christian. Think of her! What will
        become of her, if you cast her off?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have thought, Darya Alexandrovna, I have thought a great
        deal,&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch. His face turned red in patches,
        and his dim eyes looked straight before him. Darya Alexandrovna at that
        moment pitied him with all her heart. &ldquo;That was what I did indeed
        when she herself made known to me my humiliation; I left everything as
        of old. I gave her a chance to reform, I tried to save her. And with
        what result? She would not regard the slightest request&mdash;that she
        should observe decorum,&rdquo; he said, getting heated. &ldquo;One may
        save anyone who does not want to be ruined; but if the whole nature is
        so corrupt, so depraved, that ruin itself seems to be her salvation,
        what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anything, only not divorce!&rdquo; answered Darya Alexandrovna
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what is anything?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, it is awful! She will be no one&rsquo;s wife, she will be
        lost!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch, raising his
        shoulders and his eyebrows. The recollection of his wife&rsquo;s last
        act had so incensed him that he had become frigid, as at the beginning
        of the conversation. &ldquo;I am very grateful for your sympathy, but I
        must be going,&rdquo; he said, getting up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, wait a minute. You must not ruin her. Wait a little; I will
        tell you about myself. I was married, and my husband deceived me; in
        anger and jealousy, I would have thrown up everything, I would
        myself.... But I came to myself again; and who did it? Anna saved me.
        And here I am living on. The children are growing up, my husband has
        come back to his family, and feels his fault, is growing purer, better,
        and I live on.... I have forgiven it, and you ought to forgive!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch heard her, but her words had no effect on him now.
        All the hatred of that day when he had resolved on a divorce had sprung
        up again in his soul. He shook himself, and said in a shrill, loud
        voice:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Forgive I cannot, and do not wish to, and I regard it as wrong. I
        have done everything for this woman, and she has trodden it all in the
        mud to which she is akin. I am not a spiteful man, I have never hated
        anyone, but I hate her with my whole soul, and I cannot even forgive
        her, because I hate her too much for all the wrong she has done
        me!&rdquo; he said, with tones of hatred in his voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Love those that hate you....&rdquo; Darya Alexandrovna whispered
        timorously.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled contemptuously. That he knew long ago, but
        it could not be applied to his case.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Love those that hate you, but to love those one hates is
        impossible. Forgive me for having troubled you. Everyone has enough to
        bear in his own grief!&rdquo; And regaining his self-possession, Alexey
        Alexandrovitch quietly took leave and went away.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 13</h3>

      <p>
        When they rose from table, Levin would have liked to follow Kitty into
        the drawing-room; but he was afraid she might dislike this, as too
        obviously paying her attention. He remained in the little ring of men,
        taking part in the general conversation, and without looking at Kitty,
        he was aware of her movements, her looks, and the place where she was in
        the drawing-room.
      </p>

      <p>
        He did at once, and without the smallest effort, keep the promise he had
        made her&mdash;always to think well of all men, and to like everyone
        always. The conversation fell on the village commune, in which Pestsov
        saw a sort of special principle, called by him the &ldquo;choral&rdquo;
        principle. Levin did not agree with Pestsov, nor with his brother, who
        had a special attitude of his own, both admitting and not admitting the
        significance of the Russian commune. But he talked to them, simply
        trying to reconcile and soften their differences. He was not in the
        least interested in what he said himself, and even less so in what they
        said; all he wanted was that they and everyone should be happy and
        contented. He knew now the one thing of importance; and that one thing
        was at first there, in the drawing-room, and then began moving across
        and came to a standstill at the door. Without turning round he felt the
        eyes fixed on him, and the smile, and he could not help turning round.
        She was standing in the doorway with Shtcherbatsky, looking at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I thought you were going towards the piano,&rdquo; said he, going
        up to her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something I miss in the
        country&mdash;music.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; we only came to fetch you and thank you,&rdquo; she said,
        rewarding him with a smile that was like a gift, &ldquo;for coming. What
        do they want to argue for? No one ever convinces anyone, you
        know.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Levin; &ldquo;it generally
        happens that one argues warmly simply because one can&rsquo;t make out
        what one&rsquo;s opponent wants to prove.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent
        people that after enormous efforts, and an enormous expenditure of
        logical subtleties and words, the disputants finally arrived at being
        aware that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one another
        had long ago, from the beginning of the argument, been known to both,
        but that they liked different things, and would not define what they
        liked for fear of its being attacked. He had often had the experience of
        suddenly in a discussion grasping what it was his opponent liked and at
        once liking it too, and immediately he found himself agreeing, and then
        all arguments fell away as useless. Sometimes, too, he had experienced
        the opposite, expressing at last what he liked himself, which he was
        devising arguments to defend, and, chancing to express it well and
        genuinely, he had found his opponent at once agreeing and ceasing to
        dispute his position. He tried to say this.
      </p>

      <p>
        She knitted her brow, trying to understand. But directly he began to
        illustrate his meaning, she understood at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know: one must find out what he is arguing for, what is
        precious to him, then one can....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea. Levin
        smiled joyfully; he was struck by this transition from the confused,
        verbose discussion with Pestsov and his brother to this laconic, clear,
        almost wordless communication of the most complex ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shtcherbatsky moved away from them, and Kitty, going up to a card-table,
        sat down, and, taking up the chalk, began drawing diverging circles over
        the new green cloth.
      </p>

      <p>
        They began again on the subject that had been started at
        dinner&mdash;the liberty and occupations of women. Levin was of the
        opinion of Darya Alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find
        a woman&rsquo;s duties in a family. He supported this view by the fact
        that no family can get on without women to help; that in every family,
        poor or rich, there are and must be nurses, either relations or hired.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Kitty, blushing, but looking at him all the more
        boldly with her truthful eyes; &ldquo;a girl may be so circumstanced
        that she cannot live in the family without humiliation, while she
        herself....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At the hint he understood her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes&mdash;you&rsquo;re
        right; you&rsquo;re right!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he saw all that Pestsov had been maintaining at dinner of the
        liberty of woman, simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an old
        maid&rsquo;s existence and its humiliation in Kitty&rsquo;s heart; and
        loving her, he felt that terror and humiliation, and at once gave up his
        arguments.
      </p>

      <p>
        A silence followed. She was still drawing with the chalk on the table.
        Her eyes were shining with a soft light. Under the influence of her mood
        he felt in all his being a continually growing tension of happiness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;ve scribbled all over the table!&rdquo; she said,
        and, laying down the chalk, she made a movement as though to get up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What! shall I be left alone&mdash;without her?&rdquo; he thought
        with horror, and he took the chalk. &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; he
        said, sitting down to the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve long wanted to ask
        you one thing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked straight into her caressing, though frightened eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Please, ask it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said; and he wrote the initial letters,
        <i>w, y, t, m, i, c, n, b, d, t, m, n, o, t</i>. These letters meant,
        &ldquo;When you told me it could never be, did that mean never, or
        then?&rdquo; There seemed no likelihood that she could make out this
        complicated sentence; but he looked at her as though his life depended
        on her understanding the words. She glanced at him seriously, then
        leaned her puckered brow on her hands and began to read. Once or twice
        she stole a look at him, as though asking him, &ldquo;Is it what I
        think?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she said, flushing a little.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is this word?&rdquo; he said, pointing to the <i>n</i> that
        stood for <i>never</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It means <i>never</i>,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s
        not true!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He quickly rubbed out what he had written, gave her the chalk, and stood
        up. She wrote, <i>t, i, c, n, a, d</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her
        conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch when she caught sight of the two
        figures: Kitty with the chalk in her hand, with a shy and happy smile
        looking upwards at Levin, and his handsome figure bending over the table
        with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her.
        He was suddenly radiant: he had understood. It meant, &ldquo;Then I
        could not answer differently.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He glanced at her questioningly, timidly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Only then?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; her smile answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And n... and now?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, read this. I&rsquo;ll tell you what I should
        like&mdash;should like so much!&rdquo; she wrote the initial letters,
        <i>i, y, c, f, a, f, w, h.</i>
        This meant, &ldquo;If you could forget and forgive what happened.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He snatched the chalk with nervous, trembling fingers, and breaking it,
        wrote the initial letters of the following phrase, &ldquo;I have nothing
        to forget and to forgive; I have never ceased to love you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She glanced at him with a smile that did not waver.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she said in a whisper.
      </p>

      <p>
        He sat down and wrote a long phrase. She understood it all, and without
        asking him, &ldquo;Is it this?&rdquo; took the chalk and at once
        answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a long while he could not understand what she had written, and often
        looked into her eyes. He was stupefied with happiness. He could not
        supply the word she had meant; but in her charming eyes, beaming with
        happiness, he saw all he needed to know. And he wrote three letters. But
        he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her arm, and
        herself finished and wrote the answer, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re playing <i>secrétaire</i>?&rdquo; said the old
        prince. &ldquo;But we must really be getting along if you want to be in
        time at the theater.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin got up and escorted Kitty to the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        In their conversation everything had been said; it had been said that
        she loved him, and that she would tell her father and mother that he
        would come tomorrow morning.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 14</h3>

      <p>
        When Kitty had gone and Levin was left alone, he felt such uneasiness
        without her, and such an impatient longing to get as quickly, as quickly
        as possible, to tomorrow morning, when he would see her again and be
        plighted to her forever, that he felt afraid, as though of death, of
        those fourteen hours that he had to get through without her. It was
        essential for him to be with someone to talk to, so as not to be left
        alone, to kill time. Stepan Arkadyevitch would have been the companion
        most congenial to him, but he was going out, he said, to a
        <i>soirée</i>, in reality to the ballet. Levin only had time to tell him
        he was happy, and that he loved him, and would never, never forget what
        he had done for him. The eyes and the smile of Stepan Arkadyevitch
        showed Levin that he comprehended that feeling fittingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, so it&rsquo;s not time to die yet?&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, pressing Levin&rsquo;s hand with emotion.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;N-n-no!&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna too, as she said good-bye to him, gave him a sort of
        congratulation, saying, &ldquo;How glad I am you have met Kitty again!
        One must value old friends.&rdquo; Levin did not like these words of
        Darya Alexandrovna&rsquo;s. She could not understand how lofty and
        beyond her it all was, and she ought not to have dared to allude to it.
        Levin said good-bye to them, but, not to be left alone, he attached
        himself to his brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to a meeting.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll come with you. May I?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What for? Yes, come along,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch,
        smiling. &ldquo;What is the matter with you today?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;With me? Happiness is the matter with me!&rdquo; said Levin,
        letting down the window of the carriage they were driving in. &ldquo;You
        don&rsquo;t mind?&mdash;it&rsquo;s so stifling. It&rsquo;s happiness is
        the matter with me! Why is it you have never married?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very glad, she seems a nice gi....&rdquo; Sergey Ivanovitch
        was beginning.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it! don&rsquo;t say it!&rdquo; shouted Levin,
        clutching at the collar of his fur coat with both hands, and muffling
        him up in it. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a nice girl&rdquo; were such simple,
        humble words, so out of harmony with his feeling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch laughed outright a merry laugh, which was rare with
        him. &ldquo;Well, anyway, I may say that I&rsquo;m very glad of
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That you may do tomorrow, tomorrow and nothing more! Nothing,
        nothing, silence,&rdquo; said Levin, and muffling him once more in his
        fur coat, he added: &ldquo;I do like you so! Well, is it possible for me
        to be present at the meeting?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course it is.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is your discussion about today?&rdquo; asked Levin, never
        ceasing smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        They arrived at the meeting. Levin heard the secretary hesitatingly read
        the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand; but Levin saw
        from this secretary&rsquo;s face what a good, nice, kind-hearted person
        he was. This was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in reading
        the minutes. Then the discussion began. They were disputing about the
        misappropriation of certain sums and the laying of certain pipes, and
        Sergey Ivanovitch was very cutting to two members, and said something at
        great length with an air of triumph; and another member, scribbling
        something on a bit of paper, began timidly at first, but afterwards
        answered him very viciously and delightfully. And then Sviazhsky (he was
        there too) said something too, very handsomely and nobly. Levin listened
        to them, and saw clearly that these missing sums and these pipes were
        not anything real, and that they were not at all angry, but were all the
        nicest, kindest people, and everything was as happy and charming as
        possible among them. They did no harm to anyone, and were all enjoying
        it. What struck Levin was that he could see through them all today, and
        from little, almost imperceptible signs knew the soul of each, and saw
        distinctly that they were all good at heart. And Levin himself in
        particular they were all extremely fond of that day. That was evident
        from the way they spoke to him, from the friendly, affectionate way even
        those he did not know looked at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, did you like it?&rdquo; Sergey Ivanovitch asked him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very much. I never supposed it was so interesting! Capital!
        Splendid!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Sviazhsky went up to Levin and invited him to come round to tea with
        him. Levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he
        had disliked in Sviazhsky, what he had failed to find in him. He was a
        clever and wonderfully good-hearted man.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Most delighted,&rdquo; he said, and asked after his wife and
        sister-in-law. And from a queer association of ideas, because in his
        imagination the idea of Sviazhsky&rsquo;s sister-in-law was connected
        with marriage, it occurred to him that there was no one to whom he could
        more suitably speak of his happiness, and he was very glad to go and see
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sviazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate,
        presupposing, as he always did, that there was no possibility of doing
        anything not done already in Europe, and now this did not in the least
        annoy Levin. On the contrary, he felt that Sviazhsky was right, that the
        whole business was of little value, and he saw the wonderful softness
        and consideration with which Sviazhsky avoided fully expressing his
        correct view. The ladies of the Sviazhsky household were particularly
        delightful. It seemed to Levin that they knew all about it already and
        sympathized with him, saying nothing merely from delicacy. He stayed
        with them one hour, two, three, talking of all sorts of subjects but the
        one thing that filled his heart, and did not observe that he was boring
        them dreadfully, and that it was long past their bedtime.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sviazhsky went with him into the hall, yawning and wondering at the
        strange humor his friend was in. It was past one o&rsquo;clock. Levin
        went back to his hotel, and was dismayed at the thought that all alone
        now with his impatience he had ten hours still left to get through. The
        servant, whose turn it was to be up all night, lighted his candles, and
        would have gone away, but Levin stopped him. This servant, Yegor, whom
        Levin had noticed before, struck him as a very intelligent, excellent,
        and, above all, good-hearted man.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, Yegor, it&rsquo;s hard work not sleeping, isn&rsquo;t
        it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;One&rsquo;s got to put up with it! It&rsquo;s part of our work,
        you see. In a gentleman&rsquo;s house it&rsquo;s easier; but then here
        one makes more.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        It appeared that Yegor had a family, three boys and a daughter, a
        sempstress, whom he wanted to marry to a cashier in a saddler&rsquo;s
        shop.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin, on hearing this, informed Yegor that, in his opinion, in marriage
        the great thing was love, and that with love one would always be happy,
        for happiness rests only on oneself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yegor listened attentively, and obviously quite took in Levin&rsquo;s
        idea, but by way of assent to it he enunciated, greatly to Levin&rsquo;s
        surprise, the observation that when he had lived with good masters he
        had always been satisfied with his masters, and now was perfectly
        satisfied with his employer, though he was a Frenchman.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Wonderfully good-hearted fellow!&rdquo; thought Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, but you yourself, Yegor, when you got married, did you love
        your wife?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ay! and why not?&rdquo; responded Yegor.
      </p>

      <p>
        And Levin saw that Yegor too was in an excited state and intending to
        express all his most heartfelt emotions.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My life, too, has been a wonderful one. From a child
        up....&rdquo; he was beginning with flashing eyes, apparently catching
        Levin&rsquo;s enthusiasm, just as people catch yawning.
      </p>

      <p>
        But at that moment a ring was heard. Yegor departed, and Levin was left
        alone. He had eaten scarcely anything at dinner, had refused tea and
        supper at Sviazhsky&rsquo;s, but he was incapable of thinking of supper.
        He had not slept the previous night, but was incapable of thinking of
        sleep either. His room was cold, but he was oppressed by heat. He opened
        both the movable panes in his window and sat down to the table opposite
        the open panes. Over the snow-covered roofs could be seen a decorated
        cross with chains, and above it the rising triangle of Charles&rsquo;s
        Wain with the yellowish light of Capella. He gazed at the cross, then at
        the stars, drank in the fresh freezing air that flowed evenly into the
        room, and followed as though in a dream the images and memories that
        rose in his imagination. At four o&rsquo;clock he heard steps in the
        passage and peeped out at the door. It was the gambler Myaskin, whom he
        knew, coming from the club. He walked gloomily, frowning and coughing.
        &ldquo;Poor, unlucky fellow!&rdquo; thought Levin, and tears came into
        his eyes from love and pity for this man. He would have talked with him,
        and tried to comfort him, but remembering that he had nothing but his
        shirt on, he changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane to
        bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross,
        silent, but full of meaning for him, and the mounting lurid yellow star.
        At seven o&rsquo;clock there was a noise of people polishing the floors,
        and bells ringing in some servants&rsquo; department, and Levin felt
        that he was beginning to get frozen. He closed the pane, washed,
        dressed, and went out into the street.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 15</h3>

      <p>
        The streets were still empty. Levin went to the house of the
        Shtcherbatskys. The visitors&rsquo; doors were closed and everything was
        asleep. He walked back, went into his room again, and asked for coffee.
        The day servant, not Yegor this time, brought it to him. Levin would
        have entered into conversation with him, but a bell rang for the
        servant, and he went out. Levin tried to drink coffee and put some roll
        in his mouth, but his mouth was quite at a loss what to do with the
        roll. Levin, rejecting the roll, put on his coat and went out again for
        a walk. It was nine o&rsquo;clock when he reached the
        Shtcherbatskys&rsquo; steps the second time. In the house they were only
        just up, and the cook came out to go marketing. He had to get through at
        least two hours more.
      </p>

      <p>
        All that night and morning Levin lived perfectly unconsciously, and felt
        perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life. He had eaten
        nothing for a whole day, he had not slept for two nights, had spent
        several hours undressed in the frozen air, and felt not simply fresher
        and stronger than ever, but felt utterly independent of his body; he
        moved without muscular effort, and felt as if he could do anything. He
        was convinced he could fly upwards or lift the corner of the house, if
        need be. He spent the remainder of the time in the street, incessantly
        looking at his watch and gazing about him.
      </p>

      <p>
        And what he saw then, he never saw again after. The children especially
        going to school, the bluish doves flying down from the roofs to the
        pavement, and the little loaves covered with flour, thrust out by an
        unseen hand, touched him. Those loaves, those doves, and those two boys
        were not earthly creatures. It all happened at the same time: a boy ran
        towards a dove and glanced smiling at Levin; the dove, with a whir of
        her wings, darted away, flashing in the sun, amid grains of snow that
        quivered in the air, while from a little window there came a smell of
        fresh-baked bread, and the loaves were put out. All of this together was
        so extraordinarily nice that Levin laughed and cried with delight. Going
        a long way round by Gazetny Place and Kislovka, he went back again to
        the hotel, and putting his watch before him, he sat down to wait for
        twelve o&rsquo;clock. In the next room they were talking about some sort
        of machines, and swindling, and coughing their morning coughs. They did
        not realize that the hand was near twelve. The hand reached it. Levin
        went out onto the steps. The sledge-drivers clearly knew all about it.
        They crowded round Levin with happy faces, quarreling among themselves,
        and offering their services. Trying not to offend the other sledge
        drivers, and promising to drive with them too, Levin took one and told
        him to drive to the Shtcherbatskys&rsquo;. The sledge-driver was
        splendid in a white shirt-collar sticking out over his overcoat and into
        his strong, full-blooded red neck. The sledge was high and comfortable,
        and altogether such a one as Levin never drove in after, and the horse
        was a good one, and tried to gallop but didn&rsquo;t seem to move. The
        driver knew the Shtcherbatskys&rsquo; house, and drew up at the entrance
        with a curve of his arm and a &ldquo;Wo!&rdquo; especially indicative of
        respect for his fare. The Shtcherbatskys&rsquo; hall-porter certainly
        knew all about it. This was evident from the smile in his eyes and the
        way he said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a long while since you&rsquo;ve been to see us,
        Konstantin Dmitrievitch!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only he knew all about it, but he was unmistakably delighted and
        making efforts to conceal his joy. Looking into his kindly old eyes,
        Levin realized even something new in his happiness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Are they up?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Pray walk in! Leave it here,&rdquo; said he, smiling, as Levin
        would have come back to take his hat. That meant something.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To whom shall I announce your honor?&rdquo; asked the footman.
      </p>

      <p>
        The footman, though a young man, and one of the new school of footmen, a
        dandy, was a very kind-hearted, good fellow, and he too knew all about
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The princess ... the prince ... the young princess....&rdquo;
        said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first person he saw was Mademoiselle Linon. She walked across the
        room, and her ringlets and her face were beaming. He had only just
        spoken to her, when suddenly he heard the rustle of a skirt at the door,
        and Mademoiselle Linon vanished from Levin&rsquo;s eyes, and a joyful
        terror came over him at the nearness of his happiness. Mademoiselle
        Linon was in great haste, and leaving him, went out at the other door.
        Directly she had gone out, swift, swift light steps sounded on the
        parquet, and his bliss, his life, himself&mdash;what was best in
        himself, what he had so long sought and longed for&mdash;was quickly, so
        quickly approaching him. She did not walk, but seemed, by some unseen
        force, to float to him. He saw nothing but her clear, truthful eyes,
        frightened by the same bliss of love that flooded his heart. Those eyes
        were shining nearer and nearer, blinding him with their light of love.
        She stopped still close to him, touching him. Her hands rose and dropped
        onto his shoulders.
      </p>

      <p>
        She had done all she could&mdash;she had run up to him and given herself
        up entirely, shy and happy. He put his arms round her and pressed his
        lips to her mouth that sought his kiss.
      </p>

      <p>
        She too had not slept all night, and had been expecting him all the
        morning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her mother and father had consented without demur, and were happy in her
        happiness. She had been waiting for him. She wanted to be the first to
        tell him her happiness and his. She had got ready to see him alone, and
        had been delighted at the idea, and had been shy and ashamed, and did
        not know herself what she was doing. She had heard his steps and voice,
        and had waited at the door for Mademoiselle Linon to go. Mademoiselle
        Linon had gone away. Without thinking, without asking herself how and
        what, she had gone up to him, and did as she was doing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us go to mamma!&rdquo; she said, taking him by the hand. For
        a long while he could say nothing, not so much because he was afraid of
        desecrating the loftiness of his emotion by a word, as that every time
        he tried to say something, instead of words he felt that tears of
        happiness were welling up. He took her hand and kissed it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Can it be true?&rdquo; he said at last in a choked voice.
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you love me, dear!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She smiled at that &ldquo;dear,&rdquo; and at the timidity with which he
        glanced at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she said significantly, deliberately. &ldquo;I am so
        happy!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Not letting go his hands, she went into the drawing-room. The princess,
        seeing them, breathed quickly, and immediately began to cry and then
        immediately began to laugh, and with a vigorous step Levin had not
        expected, ran up to him, and hugging his head, kissed him, wetting his
        cheeks with her tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So it is all settled! I am glad. Love her. I am glad....
        Kitty!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not been long settling things,&rdquo; said the old
        prince, trying to seem unmoved; but Levin noticed that his eyes were wet
        when he turned to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve long, always wished for this!&rdquo; said the prince,
        taking Levin by the arm and drawing him towards himself. &ldquo;Even
        when this little feather-head fancied....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; shrieked Kitty, and shut his mouth with her hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very, very
        ... plea... Oh, what a fool I am....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He embraced Kitty, kissed her face, her hand, her face again, and made
        the sign of the cross over her.
      </p>

      <p>
        And there came over Levin a new feeling of love for this man, till then
        so little known to him, when he saw how slowly and tenderly Kitty kissed
        his muscular hand.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 16</h3>

      <p>
        The princess sat in her armchair, silent and smiling; the prince sat
        down beside her. Kitty stood by her father&rsquo;s chair, still holding
        his hand. All were silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        The princess was the first to put everything into words, and to
        translate all thoughts and feelings into practical questions. And all
        equally felt this strange and painful for the first minute.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;When is it to be? We must have the benediction and announcement.
        And when&rsquo;s the wedding to be? What do you think, Alexander?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; said the old prince, pointing to
        Levin&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s the principal person in the matter.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;When?&rdquo; said Levin blushing. &ldquo;Tomorrow. If you ask me,
        I should say, the benediction today and the wedding tomorrow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Come, <i>mon cher</i>, that&rsquo;s nonsense!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, in a week.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite mad.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, why so?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, upon my word!&rdquo; said the mother, smiling, delighted at
        this haste. &ldquo;How about the trousseau?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Will there really be a trousseau and all that?&rdquo; Levin
        thought with horror. &ldquo;But can the trousseau and the benediction
        and all that&mdash;can it spoil my happiness? Nothing can spoil
        it!&rdquo; He glanced at Kitty, and noticed that she was not in the
        least, not in the very least, disturbed by the idea of the trousseau.
        &ldquo;Then it must be all right,&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I know nothing about it; I only said what I should
        like,&rdquo; he said apologetically.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk it over, then. The benediction and announcement
        can take place now. That&rsquo;s very well.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The princess went up to her husband, kissed him, and would have gone
        away, but he kept her, embraced her, and, tenderly as a young lover,
        kissed her several times, smiling. The old people were obviously muddled
        for a moment, and did not quite know whether it was they who were in
        love again or their daughter. When the prince and the princess had gone,
        Levin went up to his betrothed and took her hand. He was self-possessed
        now and could speak, and he had a great deal he wanted to tell her. But
        he said not at all what he had to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How I knew it would be so! I never hoped for it; and yet in my
        heart I was always sure,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I believe that it was
        ordained.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And I!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Even when....&rdquo; She stopped
        and went on again, looking at him resolutely with her truthful eyes,
        &ldquo;Even when I thrust from me my happiness. I always loved you
        alone, but I was carried away. I ought to tell you.... Can you forgive
        that?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps it was for the best. You will have to forgive me so much.
        I ought to tell you....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This was one of the things he had meant to speak about. He had resolved
        from the first to tell her two things&mdash;that he was not chaste as
        she was, and that he was not a believer. It was agonizing, but he
        considered he ought to tell her both these facts.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, not now, later!&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, later, but you must certainly tell me. I&rsquo;m not
        afraid of anything. I want to know everything. Now it is settled.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He added: &ldquo;Settled that you&rsquo;ll take me whatever I may
        be&mdash;you won&rsquo;t give me up? Yes?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Their conversation was interrupted by Mademoiselle Linon, who with an
        affected but tender smile came to congratulate her favorite pupil.
        Before she had gone, the servants came in with their congratulations.
        Then relations arrived, and there began that state of blissful absurdity
        from which Levin did not emerge till the day after his wedding. Levin
        was in a continual state of awkwardness and discomfort, but the
        intensity of his happiness went on all the while increasing. He felt
        continually that a great deal was being expected of him&mdash;what, he
        did not know; and he did everything he was told, and it all gave him
        happiness. He had thought his engagement would have nothing about it
        like others, that the ordinary conditions of engaged couples would spoil
        his special happiness; but it ended in his doing exactly as other people
        did, and his happiness being only increased thereby and becoming more
        and more special, more and more unlike anything that had ever happened.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Now we shall have sweetmeats to eat,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle
        Linon&mdash;and Levin drove off to buy sweetmeats.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m very glad,&rdquo; said Sviazhsky. &ldquo;I advise
        you to get the bouquets from Fomin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, are they wanted?&rdquo; And he drove to Fomin&rsquo;s.
      </p>

      <p>
        His brother offered to lend him money, as he would have so many
        expenses, presents to give....
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, are presents wanted?&rdquo; And he galloped to
        Foulde&rsquo;s.
      </p>

      <p>
        And at the confectioner&rsquo;s, and at Fomin&rsquo;s, and at
        Foulde&rsquo;s he saw that he was expected; that they were pleased to
        see him, and prided themselves on his happiness, just as everyone whom
        he had to do with during those days. What was extraordinary was that
        everyone not only liked him, but even people previously unsympathetic,
        cold, and callous, were enthusiastic over him, gave way to him in
        everything, treated his feeling with tenderness and delicacy, and shared
        his conviction that he was the happiest man in the world because his
        betrothed was beyond perfection. Kitty too felt the same thing. When
        Countess Nordston ventured to hint that she had hoped for something
        better, Kitty was so angry and proved so conclusively that nothing in
        the world could be better than Levin, that Countess Nordston had to
        admit it, and in Kitty&rsquo;s presence never met Levin without a smile
        of ecstatic admiration.
      </p>

      <p>
        The confession he had promised was the one painful incident of this
        time. He consulted the old prince, and with his sanction gave Kitty his
        diary, in which there was written the confession that tortured him. He
        had written this diary at the time with a view to his future wife. Two
        things caused him anguish: his lack of purity and his lack of faith. His
        confession of unbelief passed unnoticed. She was religious, had never
        doubted the truths of religion, but his external unbelief did not affect
        her in the least. Through love she knew all his soul, and in his soul
        she saw what she wanted, and that such a state of soul should be called
        unbelieving was to her a matter of no account. The other confession set
        her weeping bitterly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin, not without an inner struggle, handed her his diary. He knew that
        between him and her there could not be, and should not be, secrets, and
        so he had decided that so it must be. But he had not realized what an
        effect it would have on her, he had not put himself in her place. It was
        only when the same evening he came to their house before the theater,
        went into her room and saw her tear-stained, pitiful, sweet face,
        miserable with suffering he had caused and nothing could undo, he felt
        the abyss that separated his shameful past from her dovelike purity, and
        was appalled at what he had done.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Take them, take these dreadful books!&rdquo; she said, pushing
        away the notebooks lying before her on the table. &ldquo;Why did you
        give them me? No, it was better anyway,&rdquo; she added, touched by his
        despairing face. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s awful, awful!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        His head sank, and he was silent. He could say nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t forgive me,&rdquo; he whispered.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I forgive you; but it&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But his happiness was so immense that this confession did not shatter
        it, it only added another shade to it. She forgave him; but from that
        time more than ever he considered himself unworthy of her, morally bowed
        down lower than ever before her, and prized more highly than ever his
        undeserved happiness.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 17</h3>

      <p>
        Unconsciously going over in his memory the conversations that had taken
        place during and after dinner, Alexey Alexandrovitch returned to his
        solitary room. Darya Alexandrovna&rsquo;s words about forgiveness had
        aroused in him nothing but annoyance. The applicability or
        non-applicability of the Christian precept to his own case was too
        difficult a question to be discussed lightly, and this question had long
        ago been answered by Alexey Alexandrovitch in the negative. Of all that
        had been said, what stuck most in his memory was the phrase of stupid,
        good-natured Turovtsin&mdash;&ldquo;<i
          >Acted like a man, he did! Called him out and shot him!</i
        >&rdquo; Everyone had apparently shared this feeling, though from
        politeness they had not expressed it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But the matter is settled, it&rsquo;s useless thinking about
        it,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself. And thinking of nothing
        but the journey before him, and the revision work he had to do, he went
        into his room and asked the porter who escorted him where his man was.
        The porter said that the man had only just gone out. Alexey
        Alexandrovitch ordered tea to be sent him, sat down to the table, and
        taking the guidebook, began considering the route of his journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Two telegrams,&rdquo; said his manservant, coming into the room.
        &ldquo;I beg your pardon, your excellency; I&rsquo;d only just that
        minute gone out.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch took the telegrams and opened them. The first
        telegram was the announcement of Stremov&rsquo;s appointment to the very
        post Karenin had coveted. Alexey Alexandrovitch flung the telegram down,
        and flushing a little, got up and began to pace up and down the room.
        &ldquo;<i>Quos vult perdere dementat</i>,&rdquo; he said, meaning by
        <i>quos</i> the persons responsible for this appointment. He was not so
        much annoyed that he had not received the post, that he had been
        conspicuously passed over; but it was incomprehensible, amazing to him
        that they did not see that the wordy phrase-monger Stremov was the last
        man fit for it. How could they fail to see how they were ruining
        themselves, lowering their <i>prestige</i> by this appointment?
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Something else in the same line,&rdquo; he said to himself
        bitterly, opening the second telegram. The telegram was from his wife.
        Her name, written in blue pencil, &ldquo;Anna,&rdquo; was the first
        thing that caught his eye. &ldquo;I am dying; I beg, I implore you to
        come. I shall die easier with your forgiveness,&rdquo; he read. He
        smiled contemptuously, and flung down the telegram. That this was a
        trick and a fraud, of that, he thought for the first minute, there could
        be no doubt.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There is no deceit she would stick at. She was near her
        confinement. Perhaps it is the confinement. But what can be their aim?
        To legitimize the child, to compromise me, and prevent a divorce,&rdquo;
        he thought. &ldquo;But something was said in it: I am dying....&rdquo;
        He read the telegram again, and suddenly the plain meaning of what was
        said in it struck him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And if it is true?&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;If it is
        true that in the moment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely
        penitent, and I, taking it for a trick, refuse to go? That would not
        only be cruel, and everyone would blame me, but it would be stupid on my
        part.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Piotr, call a coach; I am going to Petersburg,&rdquo; he said to
        his servant.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch decided that he would go to Petersburg and see his
        wife. If her illness was a trick, he would say nothing and go away
        again. If she was really in danger, and wished to see him before her
        death, he would forgive her if he found her alive, and pay her the last
        duties if he came too late.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the way he thought no more of what he ought to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent in the
        train, in the early fog of Petersburg Alexey Alexandrovitch drove
        through the deserted Nevsky and stared straight before him, not thinking
        of what was awaiting him. He could not think about it, because in
        picturing what would happen, he could not drive away the reflection that
        her death would at once remove all the difficulty of his position.
        Bakers, closed shops, night-cabmen, porters sweeping the pavements
        flashed past his eyes, and he watched it all, trying to smother the
        thought of what was awaiting him, and what he dared not hope for, and
        yet was hoping for. He drove up to the steps. A sledge and a carriage
        with the coachman asleep stood at the entrance. As he went into the
        entry, Alexey Alexandrovitch, as it were, got out his resolution from
        the remotest corner of his brain, and mastered it thoroughly. Its
        meaning ran: &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a trick, then calm contempt and
        departure. If truth, do what is proper.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The porter opened the door before Alexey Alexandrovitch rang. The
        porter, Kapitonitch, looked queer in an old coat, without a tie, and in
        slippers.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How is your mistress?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A successful confinement yesterday.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped short and turned white. He felt distinctly
        now how intensely he had longed for her death.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And how is she?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Korney in his morning apron ran downstairs.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very ill,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;There was a consultation
        yesterday, and the doctor&rsquo;s here now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Take my things,&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch, and feeling
        some relief at the news that there was still hope of her death, he went
        into the hall.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the hatstand there was a military overcoat. Alexey Alexandrovitch
        noticed it and asked:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who is here?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The doctor, the midwife, and Count Vronsky.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the inner rooms.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the drawing-room there was no one; at the sound of his steps there
        came out of her boudoir the midwife in a cap with lilac ribbons.
      </p>

      <p>
        She went up to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and with the familiarity given by
        the approach of death took him by the arm and drew him towards the
        bedroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank God you&rsquo;ve come! She keeps on about you and nothing
        but you,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Make haste with the ice!&rdquo; the doctor&rsquo;s peremptory
        voice said from the bedroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch went into her boudoir.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the table, sitting sideways in a low chair, was Vronsky, his face
        hidden in his hands, weeping. He jumped up at the doctor&rsquo;s voice,
        took his hands from his face, and saw Alexey Alexandrovitch. Seeing the
        husband, he was so overwhelmed that he sat down again, drawing his head
        down to his shoulders, as if he wanted to disappear; but he made an
        effort over himself, got up and said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She is dying. The doctors say there is no hope. I am entirely in
        your power, only let me be here ... though I am at your disposal.
        I....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch, seeing Vronsky&rsquo;s tears, felt a rush of that
        nervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other
        people&rsquo;s suffering, and turning away his face, he moved hurriedly
        to the door, without hearing the rest of his words. From the bedroom
        came the sound of Anna&rsquo;s voice saying something. Her voice was
        lively, eager, with exceedingly distinct intonations. Alexey
        Alexandrovitch went into the bedroom, and went up to the bed. She was
        lying turned with her face towards him. Her cheeks were flushed crimson,
        her eyes glittered, her little white hands thrust out from the sleeves
        of her dressing gown were playing with the quilt, twisting it about. It
        seemed as though she were not only well and blooming, but in the
        happiest frame of mind. She was talking rapidly, musically, and with
        exceptionally correct articulation and expressive intonation.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For Alexey&mdash;I am speaking of Alexey Alexandrovitch (what a
        strange and awful thing that both are Alexey, isn&rsquo;t
        it?)&mdash;Alexey would not refuse me. I should forget, he would
        forgive.... But why doesn&rsquo;t he come? He&rsquo;s so good he
        doesn&rsquo;t know himself how good he is. Ah, my God, what agony! Give
        me some water, quick! Oh, that will be bad for her, my little girl! Oh,
        very well then, give her to a nurse. Yes, I agree, it&rsquo;s better in
        fact. He&rsquo;ll be coming; it will hurt him to see her. Give her to
        the nurse.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna Arkadyevna, he has come. Here he is!&rdquo; said the
        midwife, trying to attract her attention to Alexey Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, what nonsense!&rdquo; Anna went on, not seeing her husband.
        &ldquo;No, give her to me; give me my little one! He has not come yet.
        You say he won&rsquo;t forgive me, because you don&rsquo;t know him. No
        one knows him. I&rsquo;m the only one, and it was hard for me even. His
        eyes I ought to know&mdash;Seryozha has just the same eyes&mdash;and I
        can&rsquo;t bear to see them because of it. Has Seryozha had his dinner?
        I know everyone will forget him. He would not forget. Seryozha must be
        moved into the corner room, and Mariette must be asked to sleep with
        him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        All of a sudden she shrank back, was silent; and in terror, as though
        expecting a blow, as though to defend herself, she raised her hands to
        her face. She had seen her husband.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;I am not afraid of him; I am
        afraid of death. Alexey, come here. I am in a hurry, because I&rsquo;ve
        no time, I&rsquo;ve not long left to live; the fever will begin directly
        and I shall understand nothing more. Now I understand, I understand it
        all, I see it all!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s wrinkled face wore an expression of agony;
        he took her by the hand and tried to say something, but he could not
        utter it; his lower lip quivered, but he still went on struggling with
        his emotion, and only now and then glanced at her. And each time he
        glanced at her, he saw her eyes gazing at him with such passionate and
        triumphant tenderness as he had never seen in them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Wait a minute, you don&rsquo;t know ... stay a little,
        stay!...&rdquo; She stopped, as though collecting her ideas.
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she began; &ldquo;yes, yes, yes. This is what I
        wanted to say. Don&rsquo;t be surprised at me. I&rsquo;m still the
        same.... But there is another woman in me, I&rsquo;m afraid of her: she
        loved that man, and I tried to hate you, and could not forget about her
        that used to be. I&rsquo;m not that woman. Now I&rsquo;m my real self,
        all myself. I&rsquo;m dying now, I know I shall die, ask him. Even now I
        feel&mdash;see here, the weights on my feet, on my hands, on my fingers.
        My fingers&mdash;see how huge they are! But this will soon all be
        over.... Only one thing I want: forgive me, forgive me quite. I&rsquo;m
        terrible, but my nurse used to tell me; the holy martyr&mdash;what was
        her name? She was worse. And I&rsquo;ll go to Rome; there&rsquo;s a
        wilderness, and there I shall be no trouble to anyone, only I&rsquo;ll
        take Seryozha and the little one.... No, you can&rsquo;t forgive me! I
        know, it can&rsquo;t be forgiven! No, no, go away, you&rsquo;re too
        good!&rdquo; She held his hand in one burning hand, while she pushed him
        away with the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        The nervous agitation of Alexey Alexandrovitch kept increasing, and had
        by now reached such a point that he ceased to struggle with it. He
        suddenly felt that what he had regarded as nervous agitation was on the
        contrary a blissful spiritual condition that gave him all at once a new
        happiness he had never known. He did not think that the Christian law
        that he had been all his life trying to follow, enjoined on him to
        forgive and love his enemies; but a glad feeling of love and forgiveness
        for his enemies filled his heart. He knelt down, and laying his head in
        the curve of her arm, which burned him as with fire through the sleeve,
        he sobbed like a little child. She put her arm around his head, moved
        towards him, and with defiant pride lifted up her eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That is he. I knew him! Now, forgive me, everyone, forgive me!...
        They&rsquo;ve come again; why don&rsquo;t they go away?... Oh, take
        these cloaks off me!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The doctor unloosed her hands, carefully laying her on the pillow, and
        covered her up to the shoulders. She lay back submissively, and looked
        before her with beaming eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Remember one thing, that I needed nothing but forgiveness, and I
        want nothing more.... Why doesn&rsquo;t <i>he</i> come?&rdquo; she said,
        turning to the door towards Vronsky. &ldquo;Do come, do come! Give him
        your hand.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky came to the side of the bed, and seeing Anna, again hid his face
        in his hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Uncover your face&mdash;look at him! He&rsquo;s a saint,&rdquo;
        she said. &ldquo;Oh! uncover your face, do uncover it!&rdquo; she said
        angrily. &ldquo;Alexey Alexandrovitch, do uncover his face! I want to
        see him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch took Vronsky&rsquo;s hands and drew them away from
        his face, which was awful with the expression of agony and shame upon
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Give him your hand. Forgive him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch gave him his hand, not attempting to restrain the
        tears that streamed from his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank God, thank God!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;now everything is
        ready. Only to stretch my legs a little. There, that&rsquo;s capital.
        How badly these flowers are done&mdash;not a bit like a violet,&rdquo;
        she said, pointing to the hangings. &ldquo;My God, my God! when will it
        end? Give me some morphine. Doctor, give me some morphine! Oh, my God,
        my God!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And she tossed about on the bed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The doctors said that it was puerperal fever, and that it was
        ninety-nine chances in a hundred it would end in death. The whole day
        long there was fever, delirium, and unconsciousness. At midnight the
        patient lay without consciousness, and almost without pulse.
      </p>

      <p>
        The end was expected every minute.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky had gone home, but in the morning he came to inquire, and Alexey
        Alexandrovitch meeting him in the hall, said: &ldquo;Better stay, she
        might ask for you,&rdquo; and himself led him to his wife&rsquo;s
        boudoir. Towards morning, there was a return again of excitement, rapid
        thought and talk, and again it ended in unconsciousness. On the third
        day it was the same thing, and the doctors said there was hope. That day
        Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the boudoir where Vronsky was sitting,
        and closing the door sat down opposite him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey Alexandrovitch,&rdquo; said Vronsky, feeling that a
        statement of the position was coming, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak, I
        can&rsquo;t understand. Spare me! However hard it is for you, believe
        me, it is more terrible for me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He would have risen; but Alexey Alexandrovitch took him by the hand and
        said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I beg you to hear me out; it is necessary. I must explain my
        feelings, the feelings that have guided me and will guide me, so that
        you may not be in error regarding me. You know I had resolved on a
        divorce, and had even begun to take proceedings. I won&rsquo;t conceal
        from you that in beginning this I was in uncertainty, I was in misery; I
        will confess that I was pursued by a desire to revenge myself on you and
        on her. When I got the telegram, I came here with the same feelings; I
        will say more, I longed for her death. But....&rdquo; He paused,
        pondering whether to disclose or not to disclose his feeling to him.
        &ldquo;But I saw her and forgave her. And the happiness of forgiveness
        has revealed to me my duty. I forgive completely. I would offer the
        other cheek, I would give my cloak if my coat be taken. I pray to God
        only not to take from me the bliss of forgiveness!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Tears stood in his eyes, and the luminous, serene look in them impressed
        Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This is my position: you can trample me in the mud, make me the
        laughing-stock of the world, I will not abandon her, and I will never
        utter a word of reproach to you,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch went on.
        &ldquo;My duty is clearly marked for me; I ought to be with her, and I
        will be. If she wishes to see you, I will let you know, but now I
        suppose it would be better for you to go away.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He got up, and sobs cut short his words. Vronsky too was getting up, and
        in a stooping, not yet erect posture, looked up at him from under his
        brows. He did not understand Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s feeling, but
        he felt that it was something higher and even unattainable for him with
        his view of life.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 18</h3>

      <p>
        After the conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch, Vronsky went out onto
        the steps of the Karenins&rsquo; house and stood still, with difficulty
        remembering where he was, and where he ought to walk or drive. He felt
        disgraced, humiliated, guilty, and deprived of all possibility of
        washing away his humiliation. He felt thrust out of the beaten track
        along which he had so proudly and lightly walked till then. All the
        habits and rules of his life that had seemed so firm, had turned out
        suddenly false and inapplicable. The betrayed husband, who had figured
        till that time as a pitiful creature, an incidental and somewhat
        ludicrous obstacle to his happiness, had suddenly been summoned by her
        herself, elevated to an awe-inspiring pinnacle, and on the pinnacle that
        husband had shown himself, not malignant, not false, not ludicrous, but
        kind and straightforward and large. Vronsky could not but feel this, and
        the parts were suddenly reversed. Vronsky felt his elevation and his own
        abasement, his truth and his own falsehood. He felt that the husband was
        magnanimous even in his sorrow, while he had been base and petty in his
        deceit. But this sense of his own humiliation before the man he had
        unjustly despised made up only a small part of his misery. He felt
        unutterably wretched now, for his passion for Anna, which had seemed to
        him of late to be growing cooler, now that he knew he had lost her
        forever, was stronger than ever it had been. He had seen all of her in
        her illness, had come to know her very soul, and it seemed to him that
        he had never loved her till then. And now when he had learned to know
        her, to love her as she should be loved, he had been humiliated before
        her, and had lost her forever, leaving with her nothing of himself but a
        shameful memory. Most terrible of all had been his ludicrous, shameful
        position when Alexey Alexandrovitch had pulled his hands away from his
        humiliated face. He stood on the steps of the Karenins&rsquo; house like
        one distraught, and did not know what to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A sledge, sir?&rdquo; asked the porter.

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, a sledge.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        On getting home, after three sleepless nights, Vronsky, without
        undressing, lay down flat on the sofa, clasping his hands and laying his
        head on them. His head was heavy. Images, memories, and ideas of the
        strangest description followed one another with extraordinary rapidity
        and vividness. First it was the medicine he had poured out for the
        patient and spilt over the spoon, then the midwife&rsquo;s white hands,
        then the queer posture of Alexey Alexandrovitch on the floor beside the
        bed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To sleep! To forget!&rdquo; he said to himself with the serene
        confidence of a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy, he will go
        to sleep at once. And the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy
        and he began to drop off into forgetfulness. The waves of the sea of
        unconsciousness had begun to meet over his head, when all at
        once&mdash;it was as though a violent shock of electricity had passed
        over him. He started so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa,
        and leaning on his arms got in a panic onto his knees. His eyes were
        wide open as though he had never been asleep. The heaviness in his head
        and the weariness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had
        suddenly gone.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You may trample me in the mud,&rdquo; he heard Alexey
        Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s words and saw him standing before him, and saw
        Anna&rsquo;s face with its burning flush and glittering eyes, gazing
        with love and tenderness not at him but at Alexey Alexandrovitch; he saw
        his own, as he fancied, foolish and ludicrous figure when Alexey
        Alexandrovitch took his hands away from his face. He stretched out his
        legs again and flung himself on the sofa in the same position and shut
        his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To sleep! To forget!&rdquo; he repeated to himself. But with his
        eyes shut he saw more distinctly than ever Anna&rsquo;s face as it had
        been on the memorable evening before the races.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That is not and will not be, and she wants to wipe it out of her
        memory. But I cannot live without it. How can we be reconciled? how can
        we be reconciled?&rdquo; he said aloud, and unconsciously began to
        repeat these words. This repetition checked the rising up of fresh
        images and memories, which he felt were thronging in his brain. But
        repeating words did not check his imagination for long. Again in
        extraordinarily rapid succession his best moments rose before his mind,
        and then his recent humiliation. &ldquo;Take away his hands,&rdquo;
        Anna&rsquo;s voice says. He takes away his hands and feels the
        shamestruck and idiotic expression of his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        He still lay down, trying to sleep, though he felt there was not the
        smallest hope of it, and kept repeating stray words from some chain of
        thought, trying by this to check the rising flood of fresh images. He
        listened, and heard in a strange, mad whisper words repeated: &ldquo;I
        did not appreciate it, did not make enough of it. I did not appreciate
        it, did not make enough of it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Am I going out of my mind?&rdquo; he said to
        himself. &ldquo;Perhaps. What makes men go out of their minds; what
        makes men shoot themselves?&rdquo; he answered himself, and opening his
        eyes, he saw with wonder an embroidered cushion beside him, worked by
        Varya, his brother&rsquo;s wife. He touched the tassel of the cushion,
        and tried to think of Varya, of when he had seen her last. But to think
        of anything extraneous was an agonizing effort. &ldquo;No, I must
        sleep!&rdquo; He moved the cushion up, and pressed his head into it, but
        he had to make an effort to keep his eyes shut. He jumped up and sat
        down. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all over for me,&rdquo; he said to himself.
        &ldquo;I must think what to do. What is left?&rdquo; His mind rapidly
        ran through his life apart from his love of Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ambition? Serpuhovskoy? Society? The court?&rdquo; He could not
        come to a pause anywhere. All of it had had meaning before, but now
        there was no reality in it. He got up from the sofa, took off his coat,
        undid his belt, and uncovering his hairy chest to breathe more freely,
        walked up and down the room. &ldquo;This is how people go mad,&rdquo; he
        repeated, &ldquo;and how they shoot themselves ... to escape
        humiliation,&rdquo; he added slowly.
      </p>

      <p>
        He went to the door and closed it, then with fixed eyes and clenched
        teeth he went up to the table, took a revolver, looked round him, turned
        it to a loaded barrel, and sank into thought. For two minutes, his head
        bent forward with an expression of an intense effort of thought, he
        stood with the revolver in his hand, motionless, thinking.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said to himself, as though a logical,
        continuous, and clear chain of reasoning had brought him to an
        indubitable conclusion. In reality this &ldquo;of course,&rdquo; that
        seemed convincing to him, was simply the result of exactly the same
        circle of memories and images through which he had passed ten times
        already during the last hour&mdash;memories of happiness lost forever.
        There was the same conception of the senselessness of everything to come
        in life, the same consciousness of humiliation. Even the sequence of
        these images and emotions was the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he repeated, when for the third time his
        thought passed again round the same spellbound circle of memories and
        images, and pulling the revolver to the left side of his chest, and
        clutching it vigorously with his whole hand, as it were, squeezing it in
        his fist, he pulled the trigger. He did not hear the sound of the shot,
        but a violent blow on his chest sent him reeling. He tried to clutch at
        the edge of the table, dropped the revolver, staggered, and sat down on
        the ground, looking about him in astonishment. He did not recognize his
        room, looking up from the ground, at the bent legs of the table, at the
        wastepaper basket, and the tiger-skin rug. The hurried, creaking steps
        of his servant coming through the drawing-room brought him to his
        senses. He made an effort at thought, and was aware that he was on the
        floor; and seeing blood on the tiger-skin rug and on his arm, he knew he
        had shot himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Idiotic! Missed!&rdquo; he said, fumbling after the revolver. The
        revolver was close beside him&mdash;he sought further off. Still feeling
        for it, he stretched out to the other side, and not being strong enough
        to keep his balance, fell over, streaming with blood.
      </p>

      <p>
        The elegant, whiskered manservant, who used to be continually
        complaining to his acquaintances of the delicacy of his nerves, was so
        panic-stricken on seeing his master lying on the floor, that he left him
        losing blood while he ran for assistance. An hour later Varya, his
        brother&rsquo;s wife, had arrived, and with the assistance of three
        doctors, whom she had sent for in all directions, and who all appeared
        at the same moment, she got the wounded man to bed, and remained to
        nurse him.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 19</h3>

      <p>
        The mistake made by Alexey Alexandrovitch in that, when preparing for
        seeing his wife, he had overlooked the possibility that her repentance
        might be sincere, and he might forgive her, and she might not
        die&mdash;this mistake was two months after his return from Moscow
        brought home to him in all its significance. But the mistake made by him
        had arisen not simply from his having overlooked that contingency, but
        also from the fact that until that day of his interview with his dying
        wife, he had not known his own heart. At his sick wife&rsquo;s bedside
        he had for the first time in his life given way to that feeling of
        sympathetic suffering always roused in him by the sufferings of others,
        and hitherto looked on by him with shame as a harmful weakness. And pity
        for her, and remorse for having desired her death, and most of all, the
        joy of forgiveness, made him at once conscious, not simply of the relief
        of his own sufferings, but of a spiritual peace he had never experienced
        before. He suddenly felt that the very thing that was the source of his
        sufferings had become the source of his spiritual joy; that what had
        seemed insoluble while he was judging, blaming, and hating, had become
        clear and simple when he forgave and loved.
      </p>

      <p>
        He forgave his wife and pitied her for her sufferings and her remorse.
        He forgave Vronsky, and pitied him, especially after reports reached him
        of his despairing action. He felt more for his son than before. And he
        blamed himself now for having taken too little interest in him. But for
        the little newborn baby he felt a quite peculiar sentiment, not of pity,
        only, but of tenderness. At first, from a feeling of compassion alone,
        he had been interested in the delicate little creature, who was not his
        child, and who was cast on one side during her mother&rsquo;s illness,
        and would certainly have died if he had not troubled about her, and he
        did not himself observe how fond he became of her. He would go into the
        nursery several times a day, and sit there for a long while, so that the
        nurses, who were at first afraid of him, got quite used to his presence.
        Sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would sit silently gazing at
        the saffron-red, downy, wrinkled face of the sleeping baby, watching the
        movements of the frowning brows, and the fat little hands, with clenched
        fingers, that rubbed the little eyes and nose. At such moments
        particularly, Alexey Alexandrovitch had a sense of perfect peace and
        inward harmony, and saw nothing extraordinary in his position, nothing
        that ought to be changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        But as time went on, he saw more and more distinctly that however
        natural the position now seemed to him, he would not long be allowed to
        remain in it. He felt that besides the blessed spiritual force
        controlling his soul, there was another, a brutal force, as powerful, or
        more powerful, which controlled his life, and that this force would not
        allow him that humble peace he longed for. He felt that everyone was
        looking at him with inquiring wonder, that he was not understood, and
        that something was expected of him. Above all, he felt the instability
        and unnaturalness of his relations with his wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the softening effect of the near approach of death had passed away,
        Alexey Alexandrovitch began to notice that Anna was afraid of him, ill
        at ease with him, and could not look him straight in the face. She
        seemed to be wanting, and not daring, to tell him something; and as
        though foreseeing their present relations could not continue, she seemed
        to be expecting something from him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Towards the end of February it happened that Anna&rsquo;s baby daughter,
        who had been named Anna too, fell ill. Alexey Alexandrovitch was in the
        nursery in the morning, and leaving orders for the doctor to be sent
        for, he went to his office. On finishing his work, he returned home at
        four. Going into the hall he saw a handsome groom, in a braided livery
        and a bear fur cape, holding a white fur cloak.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who is here?&rdquo; asked Alexey Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Princess Elizaveta Federovna Tverskaya,&rdquo; the groom
        answered, and it seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he grinned.
      </p>

      <p>
        During all this difficult time Alexey Alexandrovitch had noticed that
        his worldly acquaintances, especially women, took a peculiar interest in
        him and his wife. All these acquaintances he observed with difficulty
        concealing their mirth at something; the same mirth that he had
        perceived in the lawyer&rsquo;s eyes, and just now in the eyes of this
        groom. Everyone seemed, somehow, hugely delighted, as though they had
        just been at a wedding. When they met him, with ill-disguised enjoyment
        they inquired after his wife&rsquo;s health. The presence of Princess
        Tverskaya was unpleasant to Alexey Alexandrovitch from the memories
        associated with her, and also because he disliked her, and he went
        straight to the nursery. In the day nursery Seryozha, leaning on the
        table with his legs on a chair, was drawing and chatting away merrily.
        The English governess, who had during Anna&rsquo;s illness replaced the
        French one, was sitting near the boy knitting a shawl. She hurriedly got
        up, curtseyed, and pulled Seryozha.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch stroked his son&rsquo;s hair, answered the
        governess&rsquo;s inquiries about his wife, and asked what the doctor
        had said of the baby.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The doctor said it was nothing serious, and he ordered a bath,
        sir.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But she is still in pain,&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch,
        listening to the baby&rsquo;s screaming in the next room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the wet-nurse, sir,&rdquo; the Englishwoman
        said firmly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo; he asked, stopping short.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as it was at Countess Paul&rsquo;s, sir. They
        gave the baby medicine, and it turned out that the baby was simply
        hungry: the nurse had no milk, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered, and after standing still a few seconds
        he went in at the other door. The baby was lying with its head thrown
        back, stiffening itself in the nurse&rsquo;s arms, and would not take
        the plump breast offered it; and it never ceased screaming in spite of
        the double hushing of the wet-nurse and the other nurse, who was bending
        over her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Still no better?&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s very restless,&rdquo; answered the nurse in a
        whisper.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Miss Edwarde says that perhaps the wet-nurse has no milk,&rdquo;
        he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think so too, Alexey Alexandrovitch.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you say so?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s one to say it to? Anna Arkadyevna still
        ill....&rdquo; said the nurse discontentedly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The nurse was an old servant of the family. And in her simple words
        there seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch an allusion to his position.
      </p>

      <p>
        The baby screamed louder than ever, struggling and sobbing. The nurse,
        with a gesture of despair, went to it, took it from the
        wet-nurse&rsquo;s arms, and began walking up and down, rocking it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You must ask the doctor to examine the wet-nurse,&rdquo; said
        Alexey Alexandrovitch. The smartly dressed and healthy-looking nurse,
        frightened at the idea of losing her place, muttered something to
        herself, and covering her bosom, smiled contemptuously at the idea of
        doubts being cast on her abundance of milk. In that smile, too, Alexey
        Alexandrovitch saw a sneer at his position.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Luckless child!&rdquo; said the nurse, hushing the baby, and
        still walking up and down with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down, and with a despondent and suffering face
        watched the nurse walking to and fro.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the child at last was still, and had been put in a deep bed, and
        the nurse, after smoothing the little pillow, had left her, Alexey
        Alexandrovitch got up, and walking awkwardly on tiptoe, approached the
        baby. For a minute he was still, and with the same despondent face gazed
        at the baby; but all at once a smile, that moved his hair and the skin
        of his forehead, came out on his face, and he went as softly out of the
        room.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the dining-room he rang the bell, and told the servant who came in to
        send again for the doctor. He felt vexed with his wife for not being
        anxious about this exquisite baby, and in this vexed humor he had no
        wish to go to her; he had no wish, either, to see Princess Betsy. But
        his wife might wonder why he did not go to her as usual; and so,
        overcoming his disinclination, he went towards the bedroom. As he walked
        over the soft rug towards the door, he could not help overhearing a
        conversation he did not want to hear.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If he hadn&rsquo;t been going away, I could have understood your
        answer and his too. But your husband ought to be above that,&rdquo;
        Betsy was saying.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for my husband; for myself I don&rsquo;t wish it.
        Don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; answered Anna&rsquo;s excited voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but you must care to say good-bye to a man who has shot
        himself on your account....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just why I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        With a dismayed and guilty expression, Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped and
        would have gone back unobserved. But reflecting that this would be
        undignified, he turned back again, and clearing his throat, he went up
        to the bedroom. The voices were silent, and he went in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna, in a gray dressing gown, with a crop of short clustering black
        curls on her round head, was sitting on a settee. The eagerness died out
        of her face, as it always did, at the sight of her husband; she dropped
        her head and looked round uneasily at Betsy. Betsy, dressed in the
        height of the latest fashion, in a hat that towered somewhere over her
        head like a shade on a lamp, in a blue dress with violet crossway
        stripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt,
        was sitting beside Anna, her tall flat figure held erect. Bowing her
        head, she greeted Alexey Alexandrovitch with an ironical smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, as though surprised. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very
        glad you&rsquo;re at home. You never put in an appearance anywhere, and
        I haven&rsquo;t seen you ever since Anna has been ill. I have heard all
        about it&mdash;your anxiety. Yes, you&rsquo;re a wonderful
        husband!&rdquo; she said, with a meaning and affable air, as though she
        were bestowing an order of magnanimity on him for his conduct to his
        wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed frigidly, and kissing his wife&rsquo;s hand,
        asked how she was.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Better, I think,&rdquo; she said, avoiding his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve rather a feverish-looking color,&rdquo; he said,
        laying stress on the word &ldquo;feverish.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been talking too much,&rdquo; said Betsy. &ldquo;I
        feel it&rsquo;s selfishness on my part, and I am going away.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She got up, but Anna, suddenly flushing, quickly caught at her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, wait a minute, please. I must tell you ... no, you.&rdquo;
        she turned to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and her neck and brow were suffused
        with crimson. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t keep anything secret
        from you,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch cracked his fingers and bowed his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Betsy&rsquo;s been telling me that Count Vronsky wants to come
        here to say good-bye before his departure for Tashkend.&rdquo; She did
        not look at her husband, and was evidently in haste to have everything
        out, however hard it might be for her. &ldquo;I told her I could not
        receive him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You said, my dear, that it would depend on Alexey
        Alexandrovitch,&rdquo; Betsy corrected her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, I can&rsquo;t receive him; and what object would
        there....&rdquo; She stopped suddenly, and glanced inquiringly at her
        husband (he did not look at her). &ldquo;In short, I don&rsquo;t wish
        it....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch advanced and would have taken her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her first impulse was to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big
        swollen veins that sought hers, but with an obvious effort to control
        herself she pressed his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very grateful to you for your confidence, but....&rdquo; he
        said, feeling with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide
        easily and clearly by himself, he could not discuss before Princess
        Tverskaya, who to him stood for the incarnation of that brute force
        which would inevitably control him in the life he led in the eyes of the
        world, and hinder him from giving way to his feeling of love and
        forgiveness. He stopped short, looking at Princess Tverskaya.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, good-bye, my darling,&rdquo; said Betsy, getting up. She
        kissed Anna, and went out. Alexey Alexandrovitch escorted her out.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey Alexandrovitch! I know you are a truly magnanimous
        man,&rdquo; said Betsy, stopping in the little drawing-room, and with
        special warmth shaking hands with him once more. &ldquo;I am an
        outsider, but I so love her and respect you that I venture to advise.
        Receive him. Alexey Vronsky is the soul of honor, and he is going away
        to Tashkend.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you, princess, for your sympathy and advice. But the
        question of whether my wife can or cannot see anyone she must decide
        herself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He said this from habit, lifting his brows with dignity, and reflected
        immediately that whatever his words might be, there could be no dignity
        in his position. And he saw this by the suppressed, malicious, and
        ironical smile with which Betsy glanced at him after this phrase.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 20</h3>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch took leave of Betsy in the drawing-room, and went
        to his wife. She was lying down, but hearing his steps she sat up
        hastily in her former attitude, and looked in a scared way at him. He
        saw she had been crying.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very grateful for your confidence in me.&rdquo; He repeated
        gently in Russian the phrase he had said in Betsy&rsquo;s presence in
        French, and sat down beside her. When he spoke to her in Russian, using
        the Russian &ldquo;thou&rdquo; of intimacy and affection, it was
        insufferably irritating to Anna. &ldquo;And I am very grateful for your
        decision. I, too, imagine that since he is going away, there is no sort
        of necessity for Count Vronsky to come here. However, if....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve said so already, so why repeat it?&rdquo; Anna
        suddenly interrupted him with an irritation she could not succeed in
        repressing. &ldquo;No sort of necessity,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;for
        a man to come and say good-bye to the woman he loves, for whom he was
        ready to ruin himself, and has ruined himself, and who cannot live
        without him. No sort of necessity!&rdquo; she compressed her lips, and
        dropped her burning eyes to his hands with their swollen veins. They
        were rubbing each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us never speak of it,&rdquo; she added more calmly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have left this question to you to decide, and I am very glad to
        see....&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch was beginning.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That my wish coincides with your own,&rdquo; she finished
        quickly, exasperated at his talking so slowly while she knew beforehand
        all he would say.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he assented; &ldquo;and Princess Tverskaya&rsquo;s
        interference in the most difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled
        for. She especially....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of what&rsquo;s said about
        her,&rdquo; said Anna quickly. &ldquo;I know she really cares for
        me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed and said nothing. She played nervously with
        the tassel of her dressing-gown, glancing at him with that torturing
        sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself, though she
        could not control it. Her only desire now was to be rid of his
        oppressive presence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have just sent for the doctor,&rdquo; said Alexey
        Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very well; what do I want the doctor for?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, the little one cries, and they say the nurse hasn&rsquo;t
        enough milk.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you let me nurse her, when I begged to?
        Anyway&rdquo; (Alexey Alexandrovitch knew what was meant by that
        &ldquo;anyway&rdquo;), &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a baby, and they&rsquo;re
        killing her.&rdquo; She rang the bell and ordered the baby to be brought
        her. &ldquo;I begged to nurse her, I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to, and now
        I&rsquo;m blamed for it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you do blame me! My God! why didn&rsquo;t I die!&rdquo; And
        she broke into sobs. &ldquo;Forgive me, I&rsquo;m nervous, I&rsquo;m
        unjust,&rdquo; she said, controlling herself, &ldquo;but do go
        away....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, it can&rsquo;t go on like this,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch
        said to himself decidedly as he left his wife&rsquo;s room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Never had the impossibility of his position in the world&rsquo;s eyes,
        and his wife&rsquo;s hatred of him, and altogether the might of that
        mysterious brutal force that guided his life against his spiritual
        inclinations, and exacted conformity with its decrees and change in his
        attitude to his wife, been presented to him with such distinctness as
        that day. He saw clearly that all the world and his wife expected of him
        something, but what exactly, he could not make out. He felt that this
        was rousing in his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of
        mind and of all the good of his achievement. He believed that for Anna
        herself it would be better to break off all relations with Vronsky; but
        if they all thought this out of the question, he was even ready to allow
        these relations to be renewed, so long as the children were not
        disgraced, and he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his
        position. Bad as this might be, it was anyway better than a rupture,
        which would put her in a hopeless and shameful position, and deprive him
        of everything he cared for. But he felt helpless; he knew beforehand
        that everyone was against him, and that he would not be allowed to do
        what seemed to him now so natural and right, but would be forced to do
        what was wrong, though it seemed the proper thing to them.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 21</h3>

      <p>
        Before Betsy had time to walk out of the drawing-room, she was met in
        the doorway by Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had just come from
        Yeliseev&rsquo;s, where a consignment of fresh oysters had been
        received.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! princess! what a delightful meeting!&rdquo; he began.
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to see you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A meeting for one minute, for I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; said Betsy,
        smiling and putting on her glove.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put on your glove yet, princess; let me kiss your
        hand. There&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;m so thankful to the revival of the
        old fashions for as the kissing the hand.&rdquo; He kissed Betsy&rsquo;s
        hand. &ldquo;When shall we see each other?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t deserve it,&rdquo; answered Betsy, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, I deserve a great deal, for I&rsquo;ve become a most
        serious person. I don&rsquo;t only manage my own affairs, but other
        people&rsquo;s too,&rdquo; he said, with a significant expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; answered Betsy, at once
        understanding that he was speaking of Anna. And going back into the
        drawing-room, they stood in a corner. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s killing
        her,&rdquo; said Betsy in a whisper full of meaning. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
        impossible, impossible....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you think so,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        shaking his head with a serious and sympathetically distressed
        expression, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve come to Petersburg
        for.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The whole town&rsquo;s talking of it,&rdquo; she said.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an impossible position. She pines and pines away. He
        doesn&rsquo;t understand that she&rsquo;s one of those women who
        can&rsquo;t trifle with their feelings. One of two things: either let
        him take her away, act with energy, or give her a divorce. This is
        stifling her.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes ... just so....&rdquo; Oblonsky said, sighing.
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve come for. At least not solely for
        that ... I&rsquo;ve been made a <i>Kammerherr</i>; of course, one has to
        say thank you. But the chief thing was having to settle this.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, God help you!&rdquo; said Betsy.
      </p>

      <p>
        After accompanying Betsy to the outside hall, once more kissing her hand
        above the glove, at the point where the pulse beats, and murmuring to
        her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know whether to laugh or be
        angry, Stepan Arkadyevitch went to his sister. He found her in tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits, Stepan
        Arkadyevitch immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic,
        poetically emotional tone which harmonized with her mood. He asked her
        how she was, and how she had spent the morning.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very, very miserably. Today and this morning and all past days
        and days to come,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re giving way to pessimism. You must rouse
        yourself, you must look life in the face. I know it&rsquo;s hard,
        but....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have heard it said that women love men even for their
        vices,&rdquo; Anna began suddenly, &ldquo;but I hate him for his
        virtues. I can&rsquo;t live with him. Do you understand? the sight of
        him has a physical effect on me, it makes me beside myself. I
        can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t live with him. What am I to do? I have been
        unhappy, and used to think one couldn&rsquo;t be more unhappy, but the
        awful state of things I am going through now, I could never have
        conceived. Would you believe it, that knowing he&rsquo;s a good man, a
        splendid man, that I&rsquo;m not worth his little finger, still I hate
        him. I hate him for his generosity. And there&rsquo;s nothing left for
        me but....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She would have said death, but Stepan Arkadyevitch would not let her
        finish.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are ill and overwrought,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;believe me,
        you&rsquo;re exaggerating dreadfully. There&rsquo;s nothing so terrible
        in it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled. No one else in Stepan
        Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s place, having to do with such despair, would have
        ventured to smile (the smile would have seemed brutal); but in his smile
        there was so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his
        smile did not wound, but softened and soothed. His gentle, soothing
        words and smiles were as soothing and softening as almond oil. And Anna
        soon felt this.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, Stiva,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lost, lost! worse
        than lost! I can&rsquo;t say yet that all is over; on the contrary, I
        feel that it&rsquo;s not over. I&rsquo;m an overstrained string that
        must snap. But it&rsquo;s not ended yet ... and it will have a fearful
        end.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No matter, we must let the string be loosened, little by little.
        There&rsquo;s no position from which there is no way of escape.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have thought, and thought. Only one....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Again he knew from her terrified eyes that this one way of escape in her
        thought was death, and he would not let her say it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Listen to me. You can&rsquo;t
        see your own position as I can. Let me tell you candidly my
        opinion.&rdquo; Again he smiled discreetly his almond-oil smile.
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll begin from the beginning. You married a man twenty
        years older than yourself. You married him without love and not knowing
        what love was. It was a mistake, let&rsquo;s admit.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A fearful mistake!&rdquo; said Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I repeat, it&rsquo;s an accomplished fact. Then you had, let
        us say, the misfortune to love a man not your husband. That was a
        misfortune; but that, too, is an accomplished fact. And your husband
        knew it and forgave it.&rdquo; He stopped at each sentence, waiting for
        her to object, but she made no answer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. Now the
        question is: can you go on living with your husband? Do you wish it?
        Does he wish it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know nothing, nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you said yourself that you can&rsquo;t endure him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t say so. I deny it. I can&rsquo;t tell, I
        don&rsquo;t know anything about it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but let....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t understand. I feel I&rsquo;m lying head downwards
        in a sort of pit, but I ought not to save myself. And I
        can&rsquo;t....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Never mind, we&rsquo;ll slip something under and pull you out. I
        understand you: I understand that you can&rsquo;t take it on yourself to
        express your wishes, your feelings.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing, nothing I wish ... except for it to be all
        over.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But he sees this and knows it. And do you suppose it weighs on
        him any less than on you? You&rsquo;re wretched, he&rsquo;s wretched,
        and what good can come of it? while divorce would solve the difficulty
        completely.&rdquo; With some effort Stepan Arkadyevitch brought out his
        central idea, and looked significantly at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        She said nothing, and shook her cropped head in dissent. But from the
        look in her face, that suddenly brightened into its old beauty, he saw
        that if she did not desire this, it was simply because it seemed to her
        unattainable happiness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry for you! And how happy I should be if I
        could arrange things!&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling more
        boldly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak, don&rsquo;t say a word! God grant only
        that I may speak as I feel. I&rsquo;m going to him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna looked at him with dreamy, shining eyes, and said nothing.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 22</h3>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, with the same somewhat solemn expression with which
        he used to take his presidential chair at his board, walked into Alexey
        Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s room. Alexey Alexandrovitch was walking about his
        room with his hands behind his back, thinking of just what Stepan
        Arkadyevitch had been discussing with his wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interrupting you?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        on the sight of his brother-in-law becoming suddenly aware of a sense of
        embarrassment unusual with him. To conceal this embarrassment he took
        out a cigarette case he had just bought that opened in a new way, and
        sniffing the leather, took a cigarette out of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No. Do you want anything?&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch asked
        without eagerness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I wished ... I wanted ... yes, I wanted to talk to
        you,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, with surprise aware of an
        unaccustomed timidity.
      </p>

      <p>
        This feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not believe it
        was the voice of conscience telling him that what he was meaning to do
        was wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch made an effort and struggled with the timidity that
        had come over him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere
        affection and respect for you,&rdquo; he said, reddening.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch stood still and said nothing, but his face struck
        Stepan Arkadyevitch by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I intended ... I wanted to have a little talk with you about my
        sister and your mutual position,&rdquo; he said, still struggling with
        an unaccustomed constraint.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled mournfully, looked at his brother-in-law,
        and without answering went up to the table, took from it an unfinished
        letter, and handed it to his brother-in-law.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think unceasingly of the same thing. And here is what I had
        begun writing, thinking I could say it better by letter, and that my
        presence irritates her,&rdquo; he said, as he gave him the letter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch took the letter, looked with incredulous surprise at
        the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him, and began to read.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I see that my presence is irksome to you. Painful as it is to me
        to believe it, I see that it is so, and cannot be otherwise. I
        don&rsquo;t blame you, and God is my witness that on seeing you at the
        time of your illness I resolved with my whole heart to forget all that
        had passed between us and to begin a new life. I do not regret, and
        shall never regret, what I have done; but I have desired one
        thing&mdash;your good, the good of your soul&mdash;and now I see I have
        not attained that. Tell me yourself what will give you true happiness
        and peace to your soul. I put myself entirely in your hands, and trust
        to your feeling of what&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch handed back the letter, and with the same surprise
        continued looking at his brother-in-law, not knowing what to say. This
        silence was so awkward for both of them that Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s
        lips began twitching nervously, while he still gazed without speaking at
        Karenin&rsquo;s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I wanted to say to her,&rdquo; said Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, turning away.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes....&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, not able to answer
        for the tears that were choking him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, I understand you,&rdquo; he brought out at last.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I want to know what she would like,&rdquo; said Alexey
        Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am afraid she does not understand her own position. She is not
        a judge,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, recovering himself. &ldquo;She
        is crushed, simply crushed by your generosity. If she were to read this
        letter, she would be incapable of saying anything, she would only hang
        her head lower than ever.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but what&rsquo;s to be done in that case? how explain, how
        find out her wishes?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you will allow me to give my opinion, I think that it lies
        with you to point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end
        the position.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you consider it must be ended?&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch
        interrupted him. &ldquo;But how?&rdquo; he added, with a gesture of his
        hands before his eyes not usual with him. &ldquo;I see no possible way
        out of it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There is some way of getting out of every position,&rdquo; said
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, standing up and becoming more cheerful.
        &ldquo;There was a time when you thought of breaking off.... If you are
        convinced now that you cannot make each other happy....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Happiness may be variously understood. But suppose that I agree
        to everything, that I want nothing: what way is there of getting out of
        our position?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you care to know my opinion,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch
        with the same smile of softening, almond-oil tenderness with which he
        had been talking to Anna. His kindly smile was so winning that Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, feeling his own weakness and unconsciously swayed by it,
        was ready to believe what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She will never speak out about it. But one thing is possible, one
        thing she might desire,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that is the cessation
        of your relations and all memories associated with them. To my thinking,
        in your position what&rsquo;s essential is the formation of a new
        attitude to one another. And that can only rest on a basis of freedom on
        both sides.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Divorce,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted, in a tone of
        aversion.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I imagine that divorce&mdash;yes, divorce,&rdquo; Stepan
        Arkadyevitch repeated, reddening. &ldquo;That is from every point of
        view the most rational course for married people who find themselves in
        the position you are in. What can be done if married people find that
        life is impossible for them together? That may always happen.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed heavily and closed his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one point to be considered: is either of the
        parties desirous of forming new ties? If not, it is very simple,&rdquo;
        said Stepan Arkadyevitch, feeling more and more free from constraint.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch, scowling with emotion, muttered something to
        himself, and made no answer. All that seemed so simple to Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought over thousands of times.
        And, so far from being simple, it all seemed to him utterly impossible.
        Divorce, the details of which he knew by this time, seemed to him now
        out of the question, because the sense of his own dignity and respect
        for religion forbade his taking upon himself a fictitious charge of
        adultery, and still more suffering his wife, pardoned and beloved by
        him, to be caught in the fact and put to public shame. Divorce appeared
        to him impossible also on other still more weighty grounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        What would become of his son in case of a divorce? To leave him with his
        mother was out of the question. The divorced mother would have her own
        illegitimate family, in which his position as a stepson and his
        education would not be good. Keep him with him? He knew that would be an
        act of vengeance on his part, and that he did not want. But apart from
        this, what more than all made divorce seem impossible to Alexey
        Alexandrovitch was, that by consenting to a divorce he would be
        completely ruining Anna. The saying of Darya Alexandrovna at Moscow,
        that in deciding on a divorce he was thinking of himself, and not
        considering that by this he would be ruining her irrevocably, had sunk
        into his heart. And connecting this saying with his forgiveness of her,
        with his devotion to the children, he understood it now in his own way.
        To consent to a divorce, to give her her freedom, meant in his thoughts
        to take from himself the last tie that bound him to life&mdash;the
        children whom he loved; and to take from her the last prop that stayed
        her on the path of right, to thrust her down to her ruin. If she were
        divorced, he knew she would join her life to Vronsky&rsquo;s, and their
        tie would be an illegitimate and criminal one, since a wife, by the
        interpretation of the ecclesiastical law, could not marry while her
        husband was living. &ldquo;She will join him, and in a year or two he
        will throw her over, or she will form a new tie,&rdquo; thought Alexey
        Alexandrovitch. &ldquo;And I, by agreeing to an unlawful divorce, shall
        be to blame for her ruin.&rdquo; He had thought it all over hundreds of
        times, and was convinced that a divorce was not at all simple, as Stepan
        Arkadyevitch had said, but was utterly impossible. He did not believe a
        single word Stepan Arkadyevitch said to him; to every word he had a
        thousand objections to make, but he listened to him, feeling that his
        words were the expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled
        his life and to which he would have to submit.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The only question is on what terms you agree to give her a
        divorce. She does not want anything, does not dare ask you for anything,
        she leaves it all to your generosity.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My God, my God! what for?&rdquo; thought Alexey Alexandrovitch,
        remembering the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took
        the blame on himself, and with just the same gesture with which Vronsky
        had done the same, he hid his face for shame in his hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are distressed, I understand that. But if you think it
        over....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the
        other also; and if any man take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak
        also,&rdquo; thought Alexey Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; he cried in a shrill voice. &ldquo;I will take
        the disgrace on myself, I will give up even my son, but ... but
        wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to let it alone? Still you may do as you
        like....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And turning away so that his brother-in-law could not see him, he sat
        down on a chair at the window. There was bitterness, there was shame in
        his heart, but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the
        height of his own meekness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch was touched. He was silent for a space.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey Alexandrovitch, believe me, she appreciates your
        generosity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it seems it was the will of
        God,&rdquo; he added, and as he said it felt how foolish a remark it
        was, and with difficulty repressed a smile at his own foolishness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch would have made some reply, but tears stopped him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This is an unhappy fatality, and one must accept it as such. I
        accept the calamity as an accomplished fact, and am doing my best to
        help both her and you,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he went out of his brother-in-law&rsquo;s room he was touched, but
        that did not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the
        matter to a conclusion, for he felt certain Alexey Alexandrovitch would
        not go back on his words. To this satisfaction was added the fact that
        an idea had just struck him for a riddle turning on his successful
        achievement, that when the affair was over he would ask his wife and
        most intimate friends. He put this riddle into two or three different
        ways. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll work it out better than that,&rdquo; he said
        to himself with a smile.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 23</h3>

      <p>
        Vronsky&rsquo;s wound had been a dangerous one, though it did not touch
        the heart, and for several days he had lain between life and death. The
        first time he was able to speak, Varya, his brother&rsquo;s wife, was
        alone in the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Varya,&rdquo; he said, looking sternly at her, &ldquo;I shot
        myself by accident. And please never speak of it, and tell everyone so.
        Or else it&rsquo;s too ridiculous.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Without answering his words, Varya bent over him, and with a delighted
        smile gazed into his face. His eyes were clear, not feverish; but their
        expression was stern.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not in
        pain?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A little here.&rdquo; He pointed to his breast.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then let me change your bandages.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        In silence, stiffening his broad jaws, he looked at her while she
        bandaged him up. When she had finished he said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not delirious. Please manage that there may be no talk
        of my having shot myself on purpose.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No one does say so. Only I hope you won&rsquo;t shoot yourself by
        accident any more,&rdquo; she said, with a questioning smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course I won&rsquo;t, but it would have been better....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he smiled gloomily.
      </p>

      <p>
        In spite of these words and this smile, which so frightened Varya, when
        the inflammation was over and he began to recover, he felt that he was
        completely free from one part of his misery. By his action he had, as it
        were, washed away the shame and humiliation he had felt before. He could
        now think calmly of Alexey Alexandrovitch. He recognized all his
        magnanimity, but he did not now feel himself humiliated by it. Besides,
        he got back again into the beaten track of his life. He saw the
        possibility of looking men in the face again without shame, and he could
        live in accordance with his own habits. One thing he could not pluck out
        of his heart, though he never ceased struggling with it, was the regret,
        amounting to despair, that he had lost her forever. That now, having
        expiated his sin against the husband, he was bound to renounce her, and
        never in future to stand between her with her repentance and her
        husband, he had firmly decided in his heart; but he could not tear out
        of his heart his regret at the loss of her love, he could not erase from
        his memory those moments of happiness that he had so little prized at
        the time, and that haunted him in all their charm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Serpuhovskoy had planned his appointment at Tashkend, and Vronsky agreed
        to the proposition without the slightest hesitation. But the nearer the
        time of departure came, the bitterer was the sacrifice he was making to
        what he thought his duty.
      </p>

      <p>
        His wound had healed, and he was driving about making preparations for
        his departure for Tashkend.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To see her once and then to bury myself, to die,&rdquo; he
        thought, and as he was paying farewell visits, he uttered this thought
        to Betsy. Charged with this commission, Betsy had gone to Anna, and
        brought him back a negative reply.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; thought Vronsky, when he received the
        news. &ldquo;It was a weakness, which would have shattered what strength
        I have left.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Next day Betsy herself came to him in the morning, and announced that
        she had heard through Oblonsky as a positive fact that Alexey
        Alexandrovitch had agreed to a divorce, and that therefore Vronsky could
        see Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without even troubling himself to see Betsy out of his flat, forgetting
        all his resolutions, without asking when he could see her, where her
        husband was, Vronsky drove straight to the Karenins&rsquo;. He ran up
        the stairs seeing no one and nothing, and with a rapid step, almost
        breaking into a run, he went into her room. And without considering,
        without noticing whether there was anyone in the room or not, he flung
        his arms round her, and began to cover her face, her hands, her neck
        with kisses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna had been preparing herself for this meeting, had thought what she
        would say to him, but she did not succeed in saying anything of it; his
        passion mastered her. She tried to calm him, to calm herself, but it was
        too late. His feeling infected her. Her lips trembled so that for a long
        while she could say nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you have conquered me, and I am yours,&rdquo; she said at
        last, pressing his hands to her bosom.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So it had to be,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So long as we live, it
        must be so. I know it now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; she said, getting whiter and whiter,
        and embracing his head. &ldquo;Still there is something terrible in it
        after all that has happened.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It will all pass, it will all pass; we shall be so happy. Our
        love, if it could be stronger, will be strengthened by there being
        something terrible in it,&rdquo; he said, lifting his head and parting
        his strong teeth in a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        And she could not but respond with a smile&mdash;not to his words, but
        to the love in his eyes. She took his hand and stroked her chilled
        cheeks and cropped head with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you with this short hair. You&rsquo;ve grown
        so pretty. A boy. But how pale you are!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m very weak,&rdquo; she said, smiling. And her lips
        began trembling again.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to Italy; you will get strong,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Can it be possible we could be like husband and wife, alone, your
        family with you?&rdquo; she said, looking close into his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It only seems strange to me that it can ever have been
        otherwise.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Stiva says that <i>he</i> has agreed to everything, but I
        can&rsquo;t accept <i>his</i> generosity,&rdquo; she said, looking
        dreamily past Vronsky&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a divorce;
        it&rsquo;s all the same to me now. Only I don&rsquo;t know what he will
        decide about Seryozha.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He could not conceive how at this moment of their meeting she could
        remember and think of her son, of divorce. What did it all matter?
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of that, don&rsquo;t think of it,&rdquo; he
        said, turning her hand in his, and trying to draw her attention to him;
        but still she did not look at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, why didn&rsquo;t I die! it would have been better,&rdquo; she
        said, and silent tears flowed down both her cheeks; but she tried to
        smile, so as not to wound him.
      </p>

      <p>
        To decline the flattering and dangerous appointment at Tashkend would
        have been, Vronsky had till then considered, disgraceful and impossible.
        But now, without an instant&rsquo;s consideration, he declined it, and
        observing dissatisfaction in the most exalted quarters at this step, he
        immediately retired from the army.
      </p>

      <p>
        A month later Alexey Alexandrovitch was left alone with his son in his
        house at Petersburg, while Anna and Vronsky had gone abroad, not having
        obtained a divorce, but having absolutely declined all idea of one.

      <h2>PART FIVE</h2>

      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>

      <p>
        Princess Shtcherbatskaya considered that it was out of the question for
        the wedding to take place before Lent, just five weeks off, since not
        half the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time. But she could
        not but agree with Levin that to fix it for after Lent would be putting
        it off too late, as an old aunt of Prince Shtcherbatsky&rsquo;s was
        seriously ill and might die, and then the mourning would delay the
        wedding still longer. And therefore, deciding to divide the trousseau
        into two parts&mdash;a larger and smaller trousseau&mdash;the princess
        consented to have the wedding before Lent. She determined that she would
        get the smaller part of the trousseau all ready now, and the larger part
        should be made later, and she was much vexed with Levin because he was
        incapable of giving her a serious answer to the question whether he
        agreed to this arrangement or not. The arrangement was the more suitable
        as, immediately after the wedding, the young people were to go to the
        country, where the more important part of the trousseau would not be
        wanted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin still continued in the same delirious condition in which it seemed
        to him that he and his happiness constituted the chief and sole aim of
        all existence, and that he need not now think or care about anything,
        that everything was being done and would be done for him by others. He
        had not even plans and aims for the future, he left its arrangement to
        others, knowing that everything would be delightful. His brother Sergey
        Ivanovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch, and the princess guided him in doing
        what he had to do. All he did was to agree entirely with everything
        suggested to him. His brother raised money for him, the princess advised
        him to leave Moscow after the wedding. Stepan Arkadyevitch advised him
        to go abroad. He agreed to everything. &ldquo;Do what you choose, if it
        amuses you. I&rsquo;m happy, and my happiness can be no greater and no
        less for anything you do,&rdquo; he thought. When he told Kitty of
        Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s advice that they should go abroad, he was
        much surprised that she did not agree to this, and had some definite
        requirements of her own in regard to their future. She knew Levin had
        work he loved in the country. She did not, as he saw, understand this
        work, she did not even care to understand it. But that did not prevent
        her from regarding it as a matter of great importance. And then she knew
        their home would be in the country, and she wanted to go, not abroad
        where she was not going to live, but to the place where their home would
        be. This definitely expressed purpose astonished Levin. But since he did
        not care either way, he immediately asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, as though
        it were his duty, to go down to the country and to arrange everything
        there to the best of his ability with the taste of which he had so much.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I say,&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch said to him one day after
        he had come back from the country, where he had got everything ready for
        the young people&rsquo;s arrival, &ldquo;have you a certificate of
        having been at confession?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No. But what of it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be married without it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Aïe, aïe, aïe!</i>&rdquo; cried Levin. &ldquo;Why, I believe
        it&rsquo;s nine years since I&rsquo;ve taken the sacrament! I never
        thought of it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty fellow!&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch
        laughing, &ldquo;and you call me a Nihilist! But this won&rsquo;t do,
        you know. You must take the sacrament.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;When? There are four days left now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch arranged this also, and Levin had to go to
        confession. To Levin, as to any unbeliever who respects the beliefs of
        others, it was exceedingly disagreeable to be present at and take part
        in church ceremonies. At this moment, in his present softened state of
        feeling, sensitive to everything, this inevitable act of hypocrisy was
        not merely painful to Levin, it seemed to him utterly impossible. Now,
        in the heyday of his highest glory, his fullest flower, he would have to
        be a liar or a scoffer. He felt incapable of being either. But though he
        repeatedly plied Stepan Arkadyevitch with questions as to the
        possibility of obtaining a certificate without actually communicating,
        Stepan Arkadyevitch maintained that it was out of the question.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Besides, what is it to you&mdash;two days? And he&rsquo;s an
        awfully nice clever old fellow. He&rsquo;ll pull the tooth out for you
        so gently, you won&rsquo;t notice it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Standing at the first litany, Levin attempted to revive in himself his
        youthful recollections of the intense religious emotion he had passed
        through between the ages of sixteen and seventeen.
      </p>

      <p>
        But he was at once convinced that it was utterly impossible to him. He
        attempted to look at it all as an empty custom, having no sort of
        meaning, like the custom of paying calls. But he felt that he could not
        do that either. Levin found himself, like the majority of his
        contemporaries, in the vaguest position in regard to religion. Believe
        he could not, and at the same time he had no firm conviction that it was
        all wrong. And consequently, not being able to believe in the
        significance of what he was doing nor to regard it with indifference as
        an empty formality, during the whole period of preparing for the
        sacrament he was conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at doing
        what he did not himself understand, and what, as an inner voice told
        him, was therefore false and wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the service he would first listen to the prayers, trying to
        attach some meaning to them not discordant with his own views; then
        feeling that he could not understand and must condemn them, he tried not
        to listen to them, but to attend to the thoughts, observations, and
        memories which floated through his brain with extreme vividness during
        this idle time of standing in church.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had stood through the litany, the evening service and the midnight
        service, and the next day he got up earlier than usual, and without
        having tea went at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning to the church for
        the morning service and the confession.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was no one in the church but a beggar soldier, two old women, and
        the church officials. A young deacon, whose long back showed in two
        distinct halves through his thin undercassock, met him, and at once
        going to a little table at the wall read the exhortation. During the
        reading, especially at the frequent and rapid repetition of the same
        words, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on us!&rdquo; which resounded with an
        echo, Levin felt that thought was shut and sealed up, and that it must
        not be touched or stirred now or confusion would be the result; and so
        standing behind the deacon he went on thinking of his own affairs,
        neither listening nor examining what was said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
        wonderful what expression there is in her hand,&rdquo; he thought,
        remembering how they had been sitting the day before at a corner table.
        They had nothing to talk about, as was almost always the case at this
        time, and laying her hand on the table she kept opening and shutting it,
        and laughed herself as she watched her action. He remembered how he had
        kissed it and then had examined the lines on the pink palm. &ldquo;Have
        mercy on us again!&rdquo; thought Levin, crossing himself, bowing, and
        looking at the supple spring of the deacon&rsquo;s back bowing before
        him. &ldquo;She took my hand then and examined the lines.
        &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got a splendid hand,&rsquo; she said.&rdquo; And he
        looked at his own hand and the short hand of the deacon. &ldquo;Yes, now
        it will soon be over,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;No, it seems to be
        beginning again,&rdquo; he thought, listening to the prayers. &ldquo;No,
        it&rsquo;s just ending: there he is bowing down to the ground.
        That&rsquo;s always at the end.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The deacon&rsquo;s hand in a plush cuff accepted a three-rouble note
        unobtrusively, and the deacon said he would put it down in the register,
        and his new boots creaking jauntily over the flagstones of the empty
        church, he went to the altar. A moment later he peeped out thence and
        beckoned to Levin. Thought, till then locked up, began to stir in
        Levin&rsquo;s head, but he made haste to drive it away. &ldquo;It will
        come right somehow,&rdquo; he thought, and went towards the altar-rails.
        He went up the steps, and turning to the right saw the priest. The
        priest, a little old man with a scanty grizzled beard and weary,
        good-natured eyes, was standing at the altar-rails, turning over the
        pages of a missal. With a slight bow to Levin he began immediately
        reading prayers in the official voice. When he had finished them he
        bowed down to the ground and turned, facing Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Christ is present here unseen, receiving your confession,&rdquo;
        he said, pointing to the crucifix. &ldquo;Do you believe in all the
        doctrines of the Holy Apostolic Church?&rdquo; the priest went on,
        turning his eyes away from Levin&rsquo;s face and folding his hands
        under his stole.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have doubted, I doubt everything,&rdquo; said Levin in a voice
        that jarred on himself, and he ceased speaking.
      </p>

      <p>
        The priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more, and
        closing his eyes he said quickly, with a broad, Vladimirsky accent:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind, but we must pray
        that God in His mercy will strengthen us. What are your special
        sins?&rdquo; he added, without the slightest interval, as though anxious
        not to waste time.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My chief sin is doubt. I have doubts of everything, and for the
        most part I am in doubt.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind,&rdquo; the priest
        repeated the same words. &ldquo;What do you doubt about
        principally?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I doubt of everything. I sometimes even have doubts of the
        existence of God,&rdquo; Levin could not help saying, and he was
        horrified at the impropriety of what he was saying. But Levin&rsquo;s
        words did not, it seemed, make much impression on the priest.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What sort of doubt can there be of the existence of God?&rdquo;
        he said hurriedly, with a just perceptible smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin did not speak.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What doubt can you have of the Creator when you behold His
        creation?&rdquo; the priest went on in the rapid customary jargon.
        &ldquo;Who has decked the heavenly firmament with its lights? Who has
        clothed the earth in its beauty? How explain it without the
        Creator?&rdquo; he said, looking inquiringly at Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical
        discussion with the priest, and so he said in reply merely what was a
        direct answer to the question.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know! Then how can you doubt that God created
        all?&rdquo; the priest said, with good-humored perplexity.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it at all,&rdquo; said Levin, blushing,
        and feeling that his words were stupid, and that they could not be
        anything but stupid in such a position.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Pray to God and beseech Him. Even the holy fathers had doubts,
        and prayed to God to strengthen their faith. The devil has great power,
        and we must resist him. Pray to God, beseech Him. Pray to God,&rdquo; he
        repeated hurriedly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The priest paused for some time, as though meditating.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re about, I hear, to marry the daughter of my
        parishioner and son in the spirit, Prince Shtcherbatsky?&rdquo; he
        resumed, with a smile. &ldquo;An excellent young lady.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Levin, blushing for the priest. &ldquo;What
        does he want to ask me about this at confession for?&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        And, as though answering his thought, the priest said to him:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are about to enter into holy matrimony, and God may bless you
        with offspring. Well, what sort of bringing-up can you give your babes
        if you do not overcome the temptation of the devil, enticing you to
        infidelity?&rdquo; he said, with gentle reproachfulness. &ldquo;If you
        love your child as a good father, you will not desire only wealth,
        luxury, honor for your infant; you will be anxious for his salvation,
        his spiritual enlightenment with the light of truth. Eh? What answer
        will you make him when the innocent babe asks you: &lsquo;Papa! who made
        all that enchants me in this world&mdash;the earth, the waters, the sun,
        the flowers, the grass?&rsquo; Can you say to him: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
        know&rsquo;? You cannot but know, since the Lord God in His infinite
        mercy has revealed it to us. Or your child will ask you: &lsquo;What
        awaits me in the life beyond the tomb?&rsquo; What will you say to him
        when you know nothing? How will you answer him? Will you leave him to
        the allurements of the world and the devil? That&rsquo;s not
        right,&rdquo; he said, and he stopped, putting his head on one side and
        looking at Levin with his kindly, gentle eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin made no answer this time, not because he did not want to enter
        upon a discussion with the priest, but because, so far, no one had ever
        asked him such questions, and when his babes did ask him those
        questions, it would be time enough to think about answering them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are entering upon a time of life,&rdquo; pursued the priest,
        &ldquo;when you must choose your path and keep to it. Pray to God that
        He may in His mercy aid you and have mercy on you!&rdquo; he concluded.
        &ldquo;Our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, in the abundance and riches of
        His loving-kindness, forgives this child....&rdquo; and, finishing the
        prayer of absolution, the priest blessed him and dismissed him.
      </p>

      <p>
        On getting home that day, Levin had a delightful sense of relief at the
        awkward position being over and having been got through without his
        having to tell a lie. Apart from this, there remained a vague memory
        that what the kind, nice old fellow had said had not been at all so
        stupid as he had fancied at first, and that there was something in it
        that must be cleared up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course, not now,&rdquo; thought Levin, &ldquo;but some day
        later on.&rdquo; Levin felt more than ever now that there was something
        not clear and not clean in his soul, and that, in regard to religion, he
        was in the same position which he perceived so clearly and disliked in
        others, and for which he blamed his friend Sviazhsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin spent that evening with his betrothed at Dolly&rsquo;s, and was in
        very high spirits. To explain to Stepan Arkadyevitch the state of
        excitement in which he found himself, he said that he was happy like a
        dog being trained to jump through a hoop, who, having at last caught the
        idea, and done what was required of him, whines and wags its tail, and
        jumps up to the table and the windows in its delight.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

      <p>
        On the day of the wedding, according to the Russian custom (the princess
        and Darya Alexandrovna insisted on strictly keeping all the customs),
        Levin did not see his betrothed, and dined at his hotel with three
        bachelor friends, casually brought together at his rooms. These were
        Sergey Ivanovitch, Katavasov, a university friend, now professor of
        natural science, whom Levin had met in the street and insisted on taking
        home with him, and Tchirikov, his best man, a Moscow conciliation-board
        judge, Levin&rsquo;s companion in his bear-hunts. The dinner was a very
        merry one: Sergey Ivanovitch was in his happiest mood, and was much
        amused by Katavasov&rsquo;s originality. Katavasov, feeling his
        originality was appreciated and understood, made the most of it.
        Tchirikov always gave a lively and good-humored support to conversation
        of any sort.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;See, now,&rdquo; said Katavasov, drawling his words from a habit
        acquired in the lecture-room, &ldquo;what a capable fellow was our
        friend Konstantin Dmitrievitch. I&rsquo;m not speaking of present
        company, for he&rsquo;s absent. At the time he left the university he
        was fond of science, took an interest in humanity; now one-half of his
        abilities is devoted to deceiving himself, and the other to justifying
        the deceit.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A more determined enemy of matrimony than you I never saw,&rdquo;
        said Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, I&rsquo;m not an enemy of matrimony. I&rsquo;m in favor
        of division of labor. People who can do nothing else ought to rear
        people while the rest work for their happiness and enlightenment.
        That&rsquo;s how I look at it. To muddle up two trades is the error of
        the amateur; I&rsquo;m not one of their number.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How happy I shall be when I hear that you&rsquo;re in
        love!&rdquo; said Levin. &ldquo;Please invite me to the wedding.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, with a cuttlefish! You know,&rdquo; Levin turned to his
        brother, &ldquo;Mihail Semyonovitch is writing a work on the digestive
        organs of the....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, make a muddle of it! It doesn&rsquo;t matter what about. And
        the fact is, I certainly do love cuttlefish.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s no hindrance to your loving your wife.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The cuttlefish is no hindrance. The wife is the hindrance.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll see! You care about farming,
        hunting,&mdash;well, you&rsquo;d better look out!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Arhip was here today; he said there were a lot of elks in Prudno,
        and two bears,&rdquo; said Tchirikov.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you must go and get them without me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch.
        &ldquo;And you may say good-bye to bear-hunting for the
        future&mdash;your wife won&rsquo;t allow it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin smiled. The picture of his wife not letting him go was so pleasant
        that he was ready to renounce the delights of looking upon bears
        forever.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Still, it&rsquo;s a pity they should get those two bears without
        you. Do you remember last time at Hapilovo? That was a delightful
        hunt!&rdquo; said Tchirikov.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin had not the heart to disillusion him of the notion that there
        could be something delightful apart from her, and so said nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some sense in this custom of saying good-bye to
        bachelor life,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch. &ldquo;However happy you
        may be, you must regret your freedom.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And confess there is a feeling that you want to jump out of the
        window, like Gogol&rsquo;s bridegroom?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course there is, but it isn&rsquo;t confessed,&rdquo; said
        Katavasov, and he broke into loud laughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, the window&rsquo;s open. Let&rsquo;s start off this
        instant to Tver! There&rsquo;s a big she-bear; one can go right up to
        the lair. Seriously, let&rsquo;s go by the five o&rsquo;clock! And here
        let them do what they like,&rdquo; said Tchirikov, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, now, on my honor,&rdquo; said Levin, smiling, &ldquo;I
        can&rsquo;t find in my heart that feeling of regret for my
        freedom.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s such a chaos in your heart just now that you
        can&rsquo;t find anything there,&rdquo; said Katavasov. &ldquo;Wait a
        bit, when you set it to rights a little, you&rsquo;ll find it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; if so, I should have felt a little, apart from my
        feeling&rdquo; (he could not say love before them) &ldquo;and happiness,
        a certain regret at losing my freedom.... On the contrary, I am glad at
        the very loss of my freedom.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Awful! It&rsquo;s a hopeless case!&rdquo; said Katavasov.
        &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s drink to his recovery, or wish that a hundredth
        part of his dreams may be realized&mdash;and that would be happiness
        such as never has been seen on earth!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Soon after dinner the guests went away to be in time to be dressed for
        the wedding.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he was left alone, and recalled the conversation of these bachelor
        friends, Levin asked himself: had he in his heart that regret for his
        freedom of which they had spoken? He smiled at the question.
        &ldquo;Freedom! What is freedom for? Happiness is only in loving and
        wishing her wishes, thinking her thoughts, that is to say, not freedom
        at all&mdash;that&rsquo;s happiness!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But do I know her ideas, her wishes, her feelings?&rdquo; some
        voice suddenly whispered to him. The smile died away from his face, and
        he grew thoughtful. And suddenly a strange feeling came upon him. There
        came over him a dread and doubt&mdash;doubt of everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What if she does not love me? What if she&rsquo;s marrying me
        simply to be married? What if she doesn&rsquo;t see herself what
        she&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;She may come to her
        senses, and only when she is being married realize that she does not and
        cannot love me.&rdquo; And strange, most evil thoughts of her began to
        come to him. He was jealous of Vronsky, as he had been a year ago, as
        though the evening he had seen her with Vronsky had been yesterday. He
        suspected she had not told him everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        He jumped up quickly. &ldquo;No, this can&rsquo;t go on!&rdquo; he said
        to himself in despair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to her; I&rsquo;ll ask her;
        I&rsquo;ll say for the last time: we are free, and hadn&rsquo;t we
        better stay so? Anything&rsquo;s better than endless misery, disgrace,
        unfaithfulness!&rdquo; With despair in his heart and bitter anger
        against all men, against himself, against her, he went out of the hotel
        and drove to her house.
      </p>

      <p>
        He found her in one of the back rooms. She was sitting on a chest and
        making some arrangements with her maid, sorting over heaps of dresses of
        different colors, spread on the backs of chairs and on the floor.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she cried, seeing him, and beaming with delight.
        &ldquo;Kostya! Konstantin Dmitrievitch!&rdquo; (These latter days she
        used these names almost alternately.) &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you!
        I&rsquo;m going through my wardrobe to see what&rsquo;s for
        whom....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s very nice!&rdquo; he said gloomily, looking at
        the maid.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You can go, Dunyasha, I&rsquo;ll call you presently,&rdquo; said
        Kitty. &ldquo;Kostya, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she asked,
        definitely adopting this familiar name as soon as the maid had gone out.
        She noticed his strange face, agitated and gloomy, and a panic came over
        her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kitty! I&rsquo;m in torture. I can&rsquo;t suffer alone,&rdquo;
        he said with despair in his voice, standing before her and looking
        imploringly into her eyes. He saw already from her loving, truthful
        face, that nothing could come of what he had meant to say, but yet he
        wanted her to reassure him herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to say that
        there&rsquo;s still time. This can all be stopped and set right.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What? I don&rsquo;t understand. What is the matter?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What I have said a thousand times over, and can&rsquo;t help
        thinking ... that I&rsquo;m not worthy of you. You couldn&rsquo;t
        consent to marry me. Think a little. You&rsquo;ve made a mistake. Think
        it over thoroughly. You can&rsquo;t love me.... If ... better say
        so,&rdquo; he said, not looking at her. &ldquo;I shall be wretched. Let
        people say what they like; anything&rsquo;s better than misery.... Far
        better now while there&rsquo;s still time....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she answered, panic-stricken;
        &ldquo;you mean you want to give it up ... don&rsquo;t want it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, if you don&rsquo;t love me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re out of your mind!&rdquo; she cried, turning crimson
        with vexation. But his face was so piteous, that she restrained her
        vexation, and flinging some clothes off an armchair, she sat down beside
        him. &ldquo;What are you thinking? tell me all.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am thinking you can&rsquo;t love me. What can you love me
        for?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My God! what can I do?...&rdquo; she said, and burst into tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! what have I done?&rdquo; he cried, and kneeling before her,
        he fell to kissing her hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the princess came into the room five minutes later, she found them
        completely reconciled. Kitty had not simply assured him that she loved
        him, but had gone so far&mdash;in answer to his question, what she loved
        him for&mdash;as to explain what for. She told him that she loved him
        because she understood him completely, because she knew what he would
        like, and because everything he liked was good. And this seemed to him
        perfectly clear. When the princess came to them, they were sitting side
        by side on the chest, sorting the dresses and disputing over
        Kitty&rsquo;s wanting to give Dunyasha the brown dress she had been
        wearing when Levin proposed to her, while he insisted that that dress
        must never be given away, but Dunyasha must have the blue one.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How is it you don&rsquo;t see? She&rsquo;s a brunette, and it
        won&rsquo;t suit her.... I&rsquo;ve worked it all out.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Hearing why he had come, the princess was half humorously, half
        seriously angry with him, and sent him home to dress and not to hinder
        Kitty&rsquo;s hair-dressing, as Charles the hair-dresser was just
        coming.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;As it is, she&rsquo;s been eating nothing lately and is losing
        her looks, and then you must come and upset her with your
        nonsense,&rdquo; she said to him. &ldquo;Get along with you, my
        dear!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin, guilty and shamefaced, but pacified, went back to his hotel. His
        brother, Darya Alexandrovna, and Stepan Arkadyevitch, all in full dress,
        were waiting for him to bless him with the holy picture. There was no
        time to lose. Darya Alexandrovna had to drive home again to fetch her
        curled and pomaded son, who was to carry the holy pictures after the
        bride. Then a carriage had to be sent for the best man, and another that
        would take Sergey Ivanovitch away would have to be sent back....
        Altogether there were a great many most complicated matters to be
        considered and arranged. One thing was unmistakable, that there must be
        no delay, as it was already half-past six.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nothing special happened at the ceremony of benediction with the holy
        picture. Stepan Arkadyevitch stood in a comically solemn pose beside his
        wife, took the holy picture, and telling Levin to bow down to the
        ground, he blessed him with his kindly, ironical smile, and kissed him
        three times; Darya Alexandrovna did the same, and immediately was in a
        hurry to get off, and again plunged into the intricate question of the
        destinations of the various carriages.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll tell you how we&rsquo;ll manage: you drive in
        our carriage to fetch him, and Sergey Ivanovitch, if he&rsquo;ll be so
        good, will drive there and then send his carriage.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course; I shall be delighted.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come on directly with him. Are your things sent
        off?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Levin, and he told Kouzma to put out his
        clothes for him to dress.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 3</h3>

      <p>
        A crowd of people, principally women, was thronging round the church
        lighted up for the wedding. Those who had not succeeded in getting into
        the main entrance were crowding about the windows, pushing, wrangling,
        and peeping through the gratings.
      </p>

      <p>
        More than twenty carriages had already been drawn up in ranks along the
        street by the police. A police officer, regardless of the frost, stood
        at the entrance, gorgeous in his uniform. More carriages were
        continually driving up, and ladies wearing flowers and carrying their
        trains, and men taking off their helmets or black hats kept walking into
        the church. Inside the church both lusters were already lighted, and all
        the candles before the holy pictures. The gilt on the red ground of the
        holy picture-stand, and the gilt relief on the pictures, and the silver
        of the lusters and candlesticks, and the stones of the floor, and the
        rugs, and the banners above in the choir, and the steps of the altar,
        and the old blackened books, and the cassocks and surplices&mdash;all
        were flooded with light. On the right side of the warm church, in the
        crowd of frock coats and white ties, uniforms and broadcloth, velvet,
        satin, hair and flowers, bare shoulders and arms and long gloves, there
        was discreet but lively conversation that echoed strangely in the high
        cupola. Every time there was heard the creak of the opened door the
        conversation in the crowd died away, and everybody looked round
        expecting to see the bride and bridegroom come in. But the door had
        opened more than ten times, and each time it was either a belated guest
        or guests, who joined the circle of the invited on the right, or a
        spectator, who had eluded or softened the police officer, and went to
        join the crowd of outsiders on the left. Both the guests and the outside
        public had by now passed through all the phases of anticipation.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first they imagined that the bride and bridegroom would arrive
        immediately, and attached no importance at all to their being late. Then
        they began to look more and more often towards the door, and to talk of
        whether anything could have happened. Then the long delay began to be
        positively discomforting, and relations and guests tried to look as if
        they were not thinking of the bridegroom but were engrossed in
        conversation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The head deacon, as though to remind them of the value of his time,
        coughed impatiently, making the window-panes quiver in their frames. In
        the choir the bored choristers could be heard trying their voices and
        blowing their noses. The priest was continually sending first the beadle
        and then the deacon to find out whether the bridegroom had not come,
        more and more often he went himself, in a lilac vestment and an
        embroidered sash, to the side door, expecting to see the bridegroom. At
        last one of the ladies, glancing at her watch, said, &ldquo;It really is
        strange, though!&rdquo; and all the guests became uneasy and began
        loudly expressing their wonder and dissatisfaction. One of the
        bridegroom&rsquo;s best men went to find out what had happened. Kitty
        meanwhile had long ago been quite ready, and in her white dress and long
        veil and wreath of orange blossoms she was standing in the drawing-room
        of the Shtcherbatskys&rsquo; house with her sister, Madame Lvova, who
        was her bridal-mother. She was looking out of the window, and had been
        for over half an hour anxiously expecting to hear from the best man that
        her bridegroom was at the church.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin meanwhile, in his trousers, but without his coat and waistcoat,
        was walking to and fro in his room at the hotel, continually putting his
        head out of the door and looking up and down the corridor. But in the
        corridor there was no sign of the person he was looking for and he came
        back in despair, and frantically waving his hands addressed Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, who was smoking serenely.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Was ever a man in such a fearful fool&rsquo;s position?&rdquo; he
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it is stupid,&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch assented, smiling
        soothingly. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;ll be brought
        directly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, what is to be done!&rdquo; said Levin, with smothered fury.
        &ldquo;And these fools of open waistcoats! Out of the question!&rdquo;
        he said, looking at the crumpled front of his shirt. &ldquo;And what if
        the things have been taken on to the railway station!&rdquo; he roared
        in desperation.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you must put on mine.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I ought to have done so long ago, if at all.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not nice to look ridiculous.... Wait a bit! it will
        <i>come round</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The point was that when Levin asked for his evening suit, Kouzma, his
        old servant, had brought him the coat, waistcoat, and everything that
        was wanted.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But the shirt!&rdquo; cried Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a shirt on,&rdquo; Kouzma answered, with a
        placid smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kouzma had not thought of leaving out a clean shirt, and on receiving
        instructions to pack up everything and send it round to the
        Shtcherbatskys&rsquo; house, from which the young people were to set out
        the same evening, he had done so, packing everything but the dress suit.
        The shirt worn since the morning was crumpled and out of the question
        with the fashionable open waistcoat. It was a long way to send to the
        Shtcherbatskys&rsquo;. They sent out to buy a shirt. The servant came
        back; everything was shut up&mdash;it was Sunday. They sent to Stepan
        Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s and brought a shirt&mdash;it was impossibly wide
        and short. They sent finally to the Shtcherbatskys&rsquo; to unpack the
        things. The bridegroom was expected at the church while he was pacing up
        and down his room like a wild beast in a cage, peeping out into the
        corridor, and with horror and despair recalling what absurd things he
        had said to Kitty and what she might be thinking now.
      </p>

      <p>
        At last the guilty Kouzma flew panting into the room with the shirt.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Only just in time. They were just lifting it into the van,&rdquo;
        said Kouzma.
      </p>

      <p>
        Three minutes later Levin ran full speed into the corridor, not looking
        at his watch for fear of aggravating his sufferings.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t help matters like this,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch with a smile, hurrying with more deliberation after him.
        &ldquo;It will come round, it will come round ... I tell you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 4</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve come!&rdquo; &ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo; &ldquo;Which
        one?&rdquo; &ldquo;Rather young, eh?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, my dear soul,
        she looks more dead than alive!&rdquo; were the comments in the crowd,
        when Levin, meeting his bride in the entrance, walked with her into the
        church.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch told his wife the cause of the delay, and the guests
        were whispering it with smiles to one another. Levin saw nothing and no
        one; he did not take his eyes off his bride.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone said she had lost her looks dreadfully of late, and was not
        nearly so pretty on her wedding day as usual; but Levin did not think
        so. He looked at her hair done up high, with the long white veil and
        white flowers and the high, stand-up, scalloped collar, that in such a
        maidenly fashion hid her long neck at the sides and only showed it in
        front, her strikingly slender figure, and it seemed to him that she
        looked better than ever&mdash;not because these flowers, this veil, this
        gown from Paris added anything to her beauty; but because, in spite of
        the elaborate sumptuousness of her attire, the expression of her sweet
        face, of her eyes, of her lips was still her own characteristic
        expression of guileless truthfulness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I was beginning to think you meant to run away,&rdquo; she said,
        and smiled to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so stupid, what happened to me, I&rsquo;m ashamed to
        speak of it!&rdquo; he said, reddening, and he was obliged to turn to
        Sergey Ivanovitch, who came up to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This is a pretty story of yours about the shirt!&rdquo; said
        Sergey Ivanovitch, shaking his head and smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; answered Levin, without an idea of what they
        were talking about.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, Kostya, you have to decide,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch
        with an air of mock dismay, &ldquo;a weighty question. You are at this
        moment just in the humor to appreciate all its gravity. They ask me, are
        they to light the candles that have been lighted before or candles that
        have never been lighted? It&rsquo;s a matter of ten roubles,&rdquo; he
        added, relaxing his lips into a smile. &ldquo;I have decided, but I was
        afraid you might not agree.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin saw it was a joke, but he could not smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, how&rsquo;s it to be then?&mdash;unlighted or lighted
        candles? that&rsquo;s the question.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, unlighted.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m very glad. The question&rsquo;s decided!&rdquo;
        said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling. &ldquo;How silly men are, though, in
        this position,&rdquo; he said to Tchirikov, when Levin, after looking
        absently at him, had moved back to his bride.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kitty, mind you&rsquo;re the first to step on the carpet,&rdquo;
        said Countess Nordston, coming up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice
        person!&rdquo; she said to Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you frightened, eh?&rdquo; said Marya Dmitrievna, an
        old aunt.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you cold? You&rsquo;re pale. Stop a minute, stoop
        down,&rdquo; said Kitty&rsquo;s sister, Madame Lvova, and with her
        plump, handsome arms she smilingly set straight the flowers on her head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly came up, tried to say something, but could not speak, cried, and
        then laughed unnaturally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty looked at all of them with the same absent eyes as Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile the officiating clergy had got into their vestments, and the
        priest and deacon came out to the lectern, which stood in the forepart
        of the church. The priest turned to Levin saying something. Levin did
        not hear what the priest said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Take the bride&rsquo;s hand and lead her up,&rdquo; the best man
        said to Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was a long while before Levin could make out what was expected of
        him. For a long time they tried to set him right and made him begin
        again&mdash;because he kept taking Kitty by the wrong arm or with the
        wrong arm&mdash;till he understood at last that what he had to do was,
        without changing his position, to take her right hand in his right hand.
        When at last he had taken the bride&rsquo;s hand in the correct way, the
        priest walked a few paces in front of them and stopped at the lectern.
        The crowd of friends and relations moved after them, with a buzz of talk
        and a rustle of skirts. Someone stooped down and pulled out the
        bride&rsquo;s train. The church became so still that the drops of wax
        could be heard falling from the candles.
      </p>

      <p>
        The little old priest in his ecclesiastical cap, with his long
        silvery-gray locks of hair parted behind his ears, was fumbling with
        something at the lectern, putting out his little old hands from under
        the heavy silver vestment with the gold cross on the back of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch approached him cautiously, whispered something, and
        making a sign to Levin, walked back again.
      </p>

      <p>
        The priest lighted two candles, wreathed with flowers, and holding them
        sideways so that the wax dropped slowly from them he turned, facing the
        bridal pair. The priest was the same old man that had confessed Levin.
        He looked with weary and melancholy eyes at the bride and bridegroom,
        sighed, and putting his right hand out from his vestment, blessed the
        bridegroom with it, and also with a shade of solicitous tenderness laid
        the crossed fingers on the bowed head of Kitty. Then he gave them the
        candles, and taking the censer, moved slowly away from them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Can it be true?&rdquo; thought Levin, and he looked round at his
        bride. Looking down at her he saw her face in profile, and from the
        scarcely perceptible quiver of her lips and eyelashes he knew she was
        aware of his eyes upon her. She did not look round, but the high
        scalloped collar, that reached her little pink ear, trembled faintly. He
        saw that a sigh was held back in her throat, and the little hand in the
        long glove shook as it held the candle.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the fuss of the shirt, of being late, all the talk of friends and
        relations, their annoyance, his ludicrous position&mdash;all suddenly
        passed away and he was filled with joy and dread.
      </p>

      <p>
        The handsome, stately head-deacon wearing a silver robe and his curly
        locks standing out at each side of his head, stepped smartly forward,
        and lifting his stole on two fingers, stood opposite the priest.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Blessed be the name of the Lord,&rdquo; the solemn syllables rang
        out slowly one after another, setting the air quivering with waves of
        sound.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Blessed is the name of our God, from the beginning, is now, and
        ever shall be,&rdquo; the little old priest answered in a submissive,
        piping voice, still fingering something at the lectern. And the full
        chorus of the unseen choir rose up, filling the whole church, from the
        windows to the vaulted roof, with broad waves of melody. It grew
        stronger, rested for an instant, and slowly died away.
      </p>

      <p>
        They prayed, as they always do, for peace from on high and for
        salvation, for the Holy Synod, and for the Tsar; they prayed, too, for
        the servants of God, Konstantin and Ekaterina, now plighting their
        troth.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Vouchsafe to them love made perfect, peace and help, O Lord, we
        beseech Thee,&rdquo; the whole church seemed to breathe with the voice
        of the head deacon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin heard the words, and they impressed him. &ldquo;How did they guess
        that it is help, just help that one wants?&rdquo; he thought, recalling
        all his fears and doubts of late. &ldquo;What do I know? what can I do
        in this fearful business,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;without help? Yes,
        it is help I want now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        When the deacon had finished the prayer for the Imperial family, the
        priest turned to the bridal pair with a book: &ldquo;Eternal God, that
        joinest together in love them that were separate,&rdquo; he read in a
        gentle, piping voice: &ldquo;who hast ordained the union of holy wedlock
        that cannot be set asunder, Thou who didst bless Isaac and Rebecca and
        their descendants, according to Thy Holy Covenant; bless Thy servants,
        Konstantin and Ekaterina, leading them in the path of all good works.
        For gracious and merciful art Thou, our Lord, and glory be to Thee, the
        Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, now and ever shall be.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; the unseen choir sent rolling again upon the air.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Joinest together in love them that were separate.&rsquo;
        What deep meaning in those words, and how they correspond with what one
        feels at this moment,&rdquo; thought Levin. &ldquo;Is she feeling the
        same as I?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And looking round, he met her eyes, and from their expression he
        concluded that she was understanding it just as he was. But this was a
        mistake; she almost completely missed the meaning of the words of the
        service; she had not heard them, in fact. She could not listen to them
        and take them in, so strong was the one feeling that filled her breast
        and grew stronger and stronger. That feeling was joy at the completion
        of the process that for the last month and a half had been going on in
        her soul, and had during those six weeks been a joy and a torture to
        her. On the day when in the drawing-room of the house in Arbaty Street
        she had gone up to him in her brown dress, and given herself to him
        without a word&mdash;on that day, at that hour, there took place in her
        heart a complete severance from all her old life, and a quite different,
        new, utterly strange life had begun for her, while the old life was
        actually going on as before. Those six weeks had for her been a time of
        the utmost bliss and the utmost misery. All her life, all her desires
        and hopes were concentrated on this one man, still uncomprehended by
        her, to whom she was bound by a feeling of alternate attraction and
        repulsion, even less comprehended than the man himself, and all the
        while she was going on living in the outward conditions of her old life.
        Living the old life, she was horrified at herself, at her utter
        insurmountable callousness to all her own past, to things, to habits, to
        the people she had loved, who loved her&mdash;to her mother, who was
        wounded by her indifference, to her kind, tender father, till then
        dearer than all the world. At one moment she was horrified at this
        indifference, at another she rejoiced at what had brought her to this
        indifference. She could not frame a thought, not a wish apart from life
        with this man; but this new life was not yet, and she could not even
        picture it clearly to herself. There was only anticipation, the dread
        and joy of the new and the unknown. And now behold&mdash;anticipation
        and uncertainty and remorse at the abandonment of the old life&mdash;all
        was ending, and the new was beginning. This new life could not but have
        terrors for her inexperience; but, terrible or not, the change had been
        wrought six weeks before in her soul, and this was merely the final
        sanction of what had long been completed in her heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Turning again to the lectern, the priest with some difficulty took
        Kitty&rsquo;s little ring, and asking Levin for his hand, put it on the
        first joint of his finger. &ldquo;The servant of God, Konstantin,
        plights his troth to the servant of God, Ekaterina.&rdquo; And putting
        his big ring on Kitty&rsquo;s touchingly weak, pink little finger, the
        priest said the same thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they had to
        do, and each time made some mistake and were corrected by the priest in
        a whisper. At last, having duly performed the ceremony, having signed
        the rings with the cross, the priest handed Kitty the big ring, and
        Levin the little one. Again they were puzzled, and passed the rings from
        hand to hand, still without doing what was expected.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly, Tchirikov, and Stepan Arkadyevitch stepped forward to set them
        right. There was an interval of hesitation, whispering, and smiles; but
        the expression of solemn emotion on the faces of the betrothed pair did
        not change: on the contrary, in their perplexity over their hands they
        looked more grave and deeply moved than before, and the smile with which
        Stepan Arkadyevitch whispered to them that now they would each put on
        their own ring died away on his lips. He had a feeling that any smile
        would jar on them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thou who didst from the beginning create male and female,&rdquo;
        the priest read after the exchange of rings, &ldquo;from Thee woman was
        given to man to be a helpmeet to him, and for the procreation of
        children. O Lord, our God, who hast poured down the blessings of Thy
        Truth according to Thy Holy Covenant upon Thy chosen servants, our
        fathers, from generation to generation, bless Thy servants Konstantin
        and Ekaterina, and make their troth fast in faith, and union of hearts,
        and truth, and love....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin felt more and more that all his ideas of marriage, all his dreams
        of how he would order his life, were mere childishness, and that it was
        something he had not understood hitherto, and now understood less than
        ever, though it was being performed upon him. The lump in his throat
        rose higher and higher, tears that would not be checked came into his
        eyes.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 5</h3>

      <p>
        In the church there was all Moscow, all the friends and relations; and
        during the ceremony of plighting troth, in the brilliantly lighted
        church, there was an incessant flow of discreetly subdued talk in the
        circle of gaily dressed women and girls, and men in white ties,
        frockcoats, and uniforms. The talk was principally kept up by the men,
        while the women were absorbed in watching every detail of the ceremony,
        which always means so much to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the little group nearest to the bride were her two sisters: Dolly,
        and the other one, the self-possessed beauty, Madame Lvova, who had just
        arrived from abroad.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why is it Marie&rsquo;s in lilac, as bad as black, at a
        wedding?&rdquo; said Madame Korsunskaya.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;With her complexion, it&rsquo;s the one salvation,&rdquo;
        responded Madame Trubetskaya. &ldquo;I wonder why they had the wedding
        in the evening? It&rsquo;s like shop-people....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So much prettier. I was married in the evening too....&rdquo;
        answered Madame Korsunskaya, and she sighed, remembering how charming
        she had been that day, and how absurdly in love her husband was, and how
        different it all was now.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They say if anyone&rsquo;s best man more than ten times,
        he&rsquo;ll never be married. I wanted to be for the tenth time, but the
        post was taken,&rdquo; said Count Siniavin to the pretty Princess
        Tcharskaya, who had designs on him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Princess Tcharskaya only answered with a smile. She looked at Kitty,
        thinking how and when she would stand with Count Siniavin in
        Kitty&rsquo;s place, and how she would remind him then of his joke
        today.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shtcherbatsky told the old maid of honor, Madame Nikolaeva, that he
        meant to put the crown on Kitty&rsquo;s chignon for luck.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She ought not to have worn a chignon,&rdquo; answered Madame
        Nikolaeva, who had long ago made up her mind that if the elderly widower
        she was angling for married her, the wedding should be of the simplest.
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like such grandeur.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch was talking to Darya Dmitrievna, jestingly assuring
        her that the custom of going away after the wedding was becoming common
        because newly married people always felt a little ashamed of themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Your brother may feel proud of himself. She&rsquo;s a marvel of
        sweetness. I believe you&rsquo;re envious.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve got over that, Darya Dmitrievna,&rdquo; he
        answered, and a melancholy and serious expression suddenly came over his
        face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch was telling his sister-in-law his joke about
        divorce.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The wreath wants setting straight,&rdquo; she answered, not
        hearing him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a pity she&rsquo;s lost her looks so,&rdquo; Countess
        Nordston said to Madame Lvova. &ldquo;Still he&rsquo;s not worth her
        little finger, is he?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I like him so&mdash;not because he&rsquo;s my future
        <i>beau-frère</i>,&rdquo; answered Madame Lvova. &ldquo;And how well
        he&rsquo;s behaving! It&rsquo;s so difficult, too, to look well in such
        a position, not to be ridiculous. And he&rsquo;s not ridiculous, and not
        affected; one can see he&rsquo;s moved.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You expected it, I suppose?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Almost. She always cared for him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, we shall see which of them will step on the rug first. I
        warned Kitty.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It will make no difference,&rdquo; said Madame Lvova;
        &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all obedient wives; it&rsquo;s in our family.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I stepped on the rug before Vassily on purpose. And you,
        Dolly?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly stood beside them; she heard them, but she did not answer. She was
        deeply moved. The tears stood in her eyes, and she could not have spoken
        without crying. She was rejoicing over Kitty and Levin; going back in
        thought to her own wedding, she glanced at the radiant figure of Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, forgot all the present, and remembered only her own
        innocent love. She recalled not herself only, but all her women-friends
        and acquaintances. She thought of them on the one day of their triumph,
        when they had stood like Kitty under the wedding crown, with love and
        hope and dread in their hearts, renouncing the past, and stepping
        forward into the mysterious future. Among the brides that came back to
        her memory, she thought too of her darling Anna, of whose proposed
        divorce she had just been hearing. And she had stood just as innocent in
        orange flowers and bridal veil. And now? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s terribly
        strange,&rdquo; she said to herself. It was not merely the sisters, the
        women-friends and female relations of the bride who were following every
        detail of the ceremony. Women who were quite strangers, mere spectators,
        were watching it excitedly, holding their breath, in fear of losing a
        single movement or expression of the bride and bridegroom, and angrily
        not answering, often not hearing, the remarks of the callous men, who
        kept making joking or irrelevant observations.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why has she been crying? Is she being married against her
        will?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Against her will to a fine fellow like that? A prince,
        isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is that her sister in the white satin? Just listen how the deacon
        booms out, &lsquo;And fearing her husband.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Are the choristers from Tchudovo?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, from the Synod.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I asked the footman. He says he&rsquo;s going to take her home to
        his country place at once. Awfully rich, they say. That&rsquo;s why
        she&rsquo;s being married to him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re a well-matched pair.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I say, Marya Vassilievna, you were making out those fly-away
        crinolines were not being worn. Just look at her in the puce
        dress&mdash;an ambassador&rsquo;s wife they say she is&mdash;how her
        skirt bounces out from side to side!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a pretty dear the bride is&mdash;like a lamb decked with
        flowers! Well, say what you will, we women feel for our sister.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Such were the comments in the crowd of gazing women who had succeeded in
        slipping in at the church doors.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 6</h3>

      <p>
        When the ceremony of plighting troth was over, the beadle spread before
        the lectern in the middle of the church a piece of pink silken stuff,
        the choir sang a complicated and elaborate psalm, in which the bass and
        tenor sang responses to one another, and the priest turning round
        pointed the bridal pair to the pink silk rug. Though both had often
        heard a great deal about the saying that the one who steps first on the
        rug will be the head of the house, neither Levin nor Kitty were capable
        of recollecting it, as they took the few steps towards it. They did not
        hear the loud remarks and disputes that followed, some maintaining he
        had stepped on first, and others that both had stepped on together.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the customary questions, whether they desired to enter upon
        matrimony, and whether they were pledged to anyone else, and their
        answers, which sounded strange to themselves, a new ceremony began.
        Kitty listened to the words of the prayer, trying to make out their
        meaning, but she could not. The feeling of triumph and radiant happiness
        flooded her soul more and more as the ceremony went on, and deprived her
        of all power of attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        They prayed: &ldquo;Endow them with continence and fruitfulness, and
        vouchsafe that their hearts may rejoice looking upon their sons and
        daughters.&rdquo; They alluded to God&rsquo;s creation of a wife from
        Adam&rsquo;s rib &ldquo;and for this cause a man shall leave father and
        mother, and cleave unto his wife, and they two shall be one
        flesh,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;this is a great mystery&rdquo;; they
        prayed that God would make them fruitful and bless them, like Isaac and
        Rebecca, Joseph, Moses and Zipporah, and that they might look upon their
        children&rsquo;s children. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all splendid,&rdquo;
        thought Kitty, catching the words, &ldquo;all that&rsquo;s just as it
        should be,&rdquo; and a smile of happiness, unconsciously reflected in
        everyone who looked at her, beamed on her radiant face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Put it on quite,&rdquo; voices were heard urging when the priest
        had put on the wedding crowns and Shtcherbatsky, his hand shaking in its
        three-button glove, held the crown high above her head.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Put it on!&rdquo; she whispered, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin looked round at her, and was struck by the joyful radiance on her
        face, and unconsciously her feeling infected him. He too, like her felt
        glad and happy.
      </p>

      <p>
        They enjoyed hearing the epistle read, and the roll of the head
        deacon&rsquo;s voice at the last verse, awaited with such impatience by
        the outside public. They enjoyed drinking out of the shallow cup of warm
        red wine and water, and they were still more pleased when the priest,
        flinging back his stole and taking both their hands in his, led them
        round the lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting
        &ldquo;Glory to God.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Shtcherbatsky and Tchirikov, supporting the crowns and stumbling over
        the bride&rsquo;s train, smiling too and seeming delighted at something,
        were at one moment left behind, at the next treading on the bridal pair
        as the priest came to a halt. The spark of joy kindled in Kitty seemed
        to have infected everyone in the church. It seemed to Levin that the
        priest and the deacon too wanted to smile just as he did.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taking the crowns off their heads the priest read the last prayer and
        congratulated the young people. Levin looked at Kitty, and he had never
        before seen her look as she did. She was charming with the new radiance
        of happiness in her face. Levin longed to say something to her, but he
        did not know whether it was all over. The priest got him out of his
        difficulty. He smiled his kindly smile and said gently, &ldquo;Kiss your
        wife, and you kiss your husband,&rdquo; and took the candles out of
        their hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin kissed her smiling lips with timid care, gave her his arm, and
        with a new strange sense of closeness, walked out of the church. He did
        not believe, he could not believe, that it was true. It was only when
        their wondering and timid eyes met that he believed in it, because he
        felt that they were one.
      </p>

      <p>
        After supper, the same night, the young people left for the country.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 7</h3>

      <p>
        Vronsky and Anna had been traveling for three months together in Europe.
        They had visited Venice, Rome, and Naples, and had just arrived at a
        small Italian town where they meant to stay some time. A handsome head
        waiter, with thick pomaded hair parted from the neck upwards, an evening
        coat, a broad white cambric shirt front, and a bunch of trinkets hanging
        above his rounded stomach, stood with his hands in the full curve of his
        pockets, looking contemptuously from under his eyelids while he gave
        some frigid reply to a gentleman who had stopped him. Catching the sound
        of footsteps coming from the other side of the entry towards the
        staircase, the head waiter turned round, and seeing the Russian count,
        who had taken their best rooms, he took his hands out of his pockets
        deferentially, and with a bow informed him that a courier had been, and
        that the business about the palazzo had been arranged. The steward was
        prepared to sign the agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;m glad to hear it,&rdquo; said Vronsky. &ldquo;Is
        madame at home or not?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Madame has been out for a walk but has returned now,&rdquo;
        answered the waiter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky took off his soft, wide-brimmed hat and passed his handkerchief
        over his heated brow and hair, which had grown half over his ears, and
        was brushed back covering the bald patch on his head. And glancing
        casually at the gentleman, who still stood there gazing intently at him,
        he would have gone on.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This gentleman is a Russian, and was inquiring after you,&rdquo;
        said the head waiter.
      </p>

      <p>
        With mingled feelings of annoyance at never being able to get away from
        acquaintances anywhere, and longing to find some sort of diversion from
        the monotony of his life, Vronsky looked once more at the gentleman, who
        had retreated and stood still again, and at the same moment a light came
        into the eyes of both.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Golenishtchev!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Vronsky!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        It really was Golenishtchev, a comrade of Vronsky&rsquo;s in the Corps
        of Pages. In the corps Golenishtchev had belonged to the liberal party;
        he left the corps without entering the army, and had never taken office
        under the government. Vronsky and he had gone completely different ways
        on leaving the corps, and had only met once since.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that meeting Vronsky perceived that Golenishtchev had taken up a sort
        of lofty, intellectually liberal line, and was consequently disposed to
        look down upon Vronsky&rsquo;s interests and calling in life. Hence
        Vronsky had met him with the chilling and haughty manner he so well knew
        how to assume, the meaning of which was: &ldquo;You may like or dislike
        my way of life, that&rsquo;s a matter of the most perfect indifference
        to me; you will have to treat me with respect if you want to know
        me.&rdquo; Golenishtchev had been contemptuously indifferent to the tone
        taken by Vronsky. This second meeting might have been expected, one
        would have supposed, to estrange them still more. But now they beamed
        and exclaimed with delight on recognizing one another. Vronsky would
        never have expected to be so pleased to see Golenishtchev, but probably
        he was not himself aware how bored he was. He forgot the disagreeable
        impression of their last meeting, and with a face of frank delight held
        out his hand to his old comrade. The same expression of delight replaced
        the look of uneasiness on Golenishtchev&rsquo;s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How glad I am to meet you!&rdquo; said Vronsky, showing his
        strong white teeth in a friendly smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I heard the name Vronsky, but I didn&rsquo;t know which one.
        I&rsquo;m very, very glad!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in. Come, tell me what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been living here for two years. I&rsquo;m
        working.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Vronsky, with sympathy; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go
        in.&rdquo; And with the habit common with Russians, instead of saying in
        Russian what he wanted to keep from the servants, he began to speak in
        French.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know Madame Karenina? We are traveling together. I am
        going to see her now,&rdquo; he said in French, carefully scrutinizing
        Golenishtchev&rsquo;s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! I did not know&rdquo; (though he did know), Golenishtchev
        answered carelessly. &ldquo;Have you been here long?&rdquo; he added.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Four days,&rdquo; Vronsky answered, once more scrutinizing his
        friend&rsquo;s face intently.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s a decent fellow, and will look at the thing
        properly,&rdquo; Vronsky said to himself, catching the significance of
        Golenishtchev&rsquo;s face and the change of subject. &ldquo;I can
        introduce him to Anna, he looks at it properly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        During those three months that Vronsky had spent abroad with Anna, he
        had always on meeting new people asked himself how the new person would
        look at his relations with Anna, and for the most part, in men, he had
        met with the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; way of looking at it. But if he had
        been asked, and those who looked at it &ldquo;properly&rdquo; had been
        asked, exactly how they did look at it, both he and they would have been
        greatly puzzled to answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        In reality, those who in Vronsky&rsquo;s opinion had the
        &ldquo;proper&rdquo; view had no sort of view at all, but behaved in
        general as well-bred persons do behave in regard to all the complex and
        insoluble problems with which life is encompassed on all sides; they
        behaved with propriety, avoiding allusions and unpleasant questions.
        They assumed an air of fully comprehending the import and force of the
        situation, of accepting and even approving of it, but of considering it
        superfluous and uncalled for to put all this into words.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky at once divined that Golenishtchev was of this class, and
        therefore was doubly pleased to see him. And in fact,
        Golenishtchev&rsquo;s manner to Madame Karenina, when he was taken to
        call on her, was all that Vronsky could have desired. Obviously without
        the slightest effort he steered clear of all subjects which might lead
        to embarrassment.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had never met Anna before, and was struck by her beauty, and still
        more by the frankness with which she accepted her position. She blushed
        when Vronsky brought in Golenishtchev, and he was extremely charmed by
        this childish blush overspreading her candid and handsome face. But what
        he liked particularly was the way in which at once, as though on purpose
        that there might be no misunderstanding with an outsider, she called
        Vronsky simply Alexey, and said they were moving into a house they had
        just taken, what was here called a palazzo. Golenishtchev liked this
        direct and simple attitude to her own position. Looking at Anna&rsquo;s
        manner of simple-hearted, spirited gaiety, and knowing Alexey
        Alexandrovitch and Vronsky, Golenishtchev fancied that he understood her
        perfectly. He fancied that he understood what she was utterly unable to
        understand: how it was that, having made her husband wretched, having
        abandoned him and her son and lost her good name, she yet felt full of
        spirits, gaiety, and happiness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the guide-book,&rdquo; said Golenishtchev,
        referring to the palazzo Vronsky had taken. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
        first-rate Tintoretto there. One of his latest period.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you what: it&rsquo;s a lovely day, let&rsquo;s go and have
        another look at it,&rdquo; said Vronsky, addressing Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall be very glad to; I&rsquo;ll go and put on my hat. Would
        you say it&rsquo;s hot?&rdquo; she said, stopping short in the doorway
        and looking inquiringly at Vronsky. And again a vivid flush overspread
        her face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky saw from her eyes that she did not know on what terms he cared
        to be with Golenishtchev, and so was afraid of not behaving as he would
        wish.
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked a long, tender look at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, not very,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        And it seemed to her that she understood everything, most of all, that
        he was pleased with her; and smiling to him, she walked with her rapid
        step out at the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        The friends glanced at one another, and a look of hesitation came into
        both faces, as though Golenishtchev, unmistakably admiring her, would
        have liked to say something about her, and could not find the right
        thing to say, while Vronsky desired and dreaded his doing so.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; Vronsky began to start a conversation of some
        sort; &ldquo;so you&rsquo;re settled here? You&rsquo;re still at the
        same work, then?&rdquo; he went on, recalling that he had been told
        Golenishtchev was writing something.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m writing the second part of the
        <i>Two Elements</i>,&rdquo; said Golenishtchev, coloring with pleasure
        at the question&mdash;&ldquo;that is, to be exact, I am not writing it
        yet; I am preparing, collecting materials. It will be of far wider
        scope, and will touch on almost all questions. We in Russia refuse to
        see that we are the heirs of Byzantium,&rdquo; and he launched into a
        long and heated explanation of his views.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky at the first moment felt embarrassed at not even knowing of the
        first part of the <i>Two Elements</i>, of which the author spoke as
        something well known. But as Golenishtchev began to lay down his
        opinions and Vronsky was able to follow them even without knowing the
        <i>Two Elements</i>, he listened to him with some interest, for
        Golenishtchev spoke well. But Vronsky was startled and annoyed by the
        nervous irascibility with which Golenishtchev talked of the subject that
        engrossed him. As he went on talking, his eyes glittered more and more
        angrily; he was more and more hurried in his replies to imaginary
        opponents, and his face grew more and more excited and worried.
        Remembering Golenishtchev, a thin, lively, good-natured and well-bred
        boy, always at the head of the class, Vronsky could not make out the
        reason of his irritability, and he did not like it. What he particularly
        disliked was that Golenishtchev, a man belonging to a good set, should
        put himself on a level with some scribbling fellows, with whom he was
        irritated and angry. Was it worth it? Vronsky disliked it, yet he felt
        that Golenishtchev was unhappy, and was sorry for him. Unhappiness,
        almost mental derangement, was visible on his mobile, rather handsome
        face, while without even noticing Anna&rsquo;s coming in, he went on
        hurriedly and hotly expressing his views.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Anna came in in her hat and cape, and her lovely hand rapidly
        swinging her parasol, and stood beside him, it was with a feeling of
        relief that Vronsky broke away from the plaintive eyes of Golenishtchev
        which fastened persistently upon him, and with a fresh rush of love
        looked at his charming companion, full of life and happiness.
        Golenishtchev recovered himself with an effort, and at first was
        dejected and gloomy, but Anna, disposed to feel friendly with everyone
        as she was at that time, soon revived his spirits by her direct and
        lively manner. After trying various subjects of conversation, she got
        him upon painting, of which he talked very well, and she listened to him
        attentively. They walked to the house they had taken, and looked over
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very glad of one thing,&rdquo; said Anna to Golenishtchev
        when they were on their way back, &ldquo;Alexey will have a capital
        <i>atelier</i>. You must certainly take that room,&rdquo; she said to
        Vronsky in Russian, using the affectionately familiar form as though she
        saw that Golenishtchev would become intimate with them in their
        isolation, and that there was no need of reserve before him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you paint?&rdquo; said Golenishtchev, turning round quickly to
        Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I used to study long ago, and now I have begun to do a
        little,&rdquo; said Vronsky, reddening.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He has great talent,&rdquo; said Anna with a delighted smile.
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no judge, of course. But good judges have said the
        same.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 8</h3>

      <p>
        Anna, in that first period of her emancipation and rapid return to
        health, felt herself unpardonably happy and full of the joy of life. The
        thought of her husband&rsquo;s unhappiness did not poison her happiness.
        On one side that memory was too awful to be thought of. On the other
        side her husband&rsquo;s unhappiness had given her too much happiness to
        be regretted. The memory of all that had happened after her illness: her
        reconciliation with her husband, its breakdown, the news of
        Vronsky&rsquo;s wound, his visit, the preparations for divorce, the
        departure from her husband&rsquo;s house, the parting from her
        son&mdash;all that seemed to her like a delirious dream, from which she
        had waked up alone with Vronsky abroad. The thought of the harm caused
        to her husband aroused in her a feeling like repulsion, and akin to what
        a drowning man might feel who has shaken off another man clinging to
        him. That man did drown. It was an evil action, of course, but it was
        the sole means of escape, and better not to brood over these fearful
        facts.
      </p>

      <p>
        One consolatory reflection upon her conduct had occurred to her at the
        first moment of the final rupture, and when now she recalled all the
        past, she remembered that one reflection. &ldquo;I have inevitably made
        that man wretched,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t want to
        profit by his misery. I too am suffering, and shall suffer; I am losing
        what I prized above everything&mdash;I am losing my good name and my
        son. I have done wrong, and so I don&rsquo;t want happiness, I
        don&rsquo;t want a divorce, and shall suffer from my shame and the
        separation from my child.&rdquo; But, however sincerely Anna had meant
        to suffer, she was not suffering. Shame there was not. With the tact of
        which both had such a large share, they had succeeded in avoiding
        Russian ladies abroad, and so had never placed themselves in a false
        position, and everywhere they had met people who pretended that they
        perfectly understood their position, far better indeed than they did
        themselves. Separation from the son she loved&mdash;even that did not
        cause her anguish in these early days. The baby girl&mdash;<i>his</i>
        child&mdash;was so sweet, and had so won Anna&rsquo;s heart, since she
        was all that was left her, that Anna rarely thought of her son.
      </p>

      <p>
        The desire for life, waxing stronger with recovered health, was so
        intense, and the conditions of life were so new and pleasant, that Anna
        felt unpardonably happy. The more she got to know Vronsky, the more she
        loved him. She loved him for himself, and for his love for her. Her
        complete ownership of him was a continual joy to her. His presence was
        always sweet to her. All the traits of his character, which she learned
        to know better and better, were unutterably dear to her. His appearance,
        changed by his civilian dress, was as fascinating to her as though she
        were some young girl in love. In everything he said, thought, and did,
        she saw something particularly noble and elevated. Her adoration of him
        alarmed her indeed; she sought and could not find in him anything not
        fine. She dared not show him her sense of her own insignificance beside
        him. It seemed to her that, knowing this, he might sooner cease to love
        her; and she dreaded nothing now so much as losing his love, though she
        had no grounds for fearing it. But she could not help being grateful to
        him for his attitude to her, and showing that she appreciated it. He,
        who had in her opinion such a marked aptitude for a political career, in
        which he would have been certain to play a leading part&mdash;he had
        sacrificed his ambition for her sake, and never betrayed the slightest
        regret. He was more lovingly respectful to her than ever, and the
        constant care that she should not feel the awkwardness of her position
        never deserted him for a single instant. He, so manly a man, never
        opposed her, had indeed, with her, no will of his own, and was anxious,
        it seemed, for nothing but to anticipate her wishes. And she could not
        but appreciate this, even though the very intensity of his solicitude
        for her, the atmosphere of care with which he surrounded her, sometimes
        weighed upon her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky, meanwhile, in spite of the complete realization of what he had
        so long desired, was not perfectly happy. He soon felt that the
        realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of
        the mountain of happiness he had expected. It showed him the mistake men
        make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their
        desires. For a time after joining his life to hers, and putting on
        civilian dress, he had felt all the delight of freedom in general of
        which he had known nothing before, and of freedom in his love,&mdash;and
        he was content, but not for long. He was soon aware that there was
        springing up in his heart a desire for desires&mdash;<i>ennui</i>.
        Without conscious intention he began to clutch at every passing caprice,
        taking it for a desire and an object. Sixteen hours of the day must be
        occupied in some way, since they were living abroad in complete freedom,
        outside the conditions of social life which filled up time in
        Petersburg. As for the amusements of bachelor existence, which had
        provided Vronsky with entertainment on previous tours abroad, they could
        not be thought of, since the sole attempt of the sort had led to a
        sudden attack of depression in Anna, quite out of proportion with the
        cause&mdash;a late supper with bachelor friends. Relations with the
        society of the place&mdash;foreign and Russian&mdash;were equally out of
        the question owing to the irregularity of their position. The inspection
        of objects of interest, apart from the fact that everything had been
        seen already, had not for Vronsky, a Russian and a sensible man, the
        immense significance Englishmen are able to attach to that pursuit.
      </p>

      <p>
        And just as the hungry stomach eagerly accepts every object it can get,
        hoping to find nourishment in it, Vronsky quite unconsciously clutched
        first at politics, then at new books, and then at pictures.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he had from a child a taste for painting, and as, not knowing what to
        spend his money on, he had begun collecting engravings, he came to a
        stop at painting, began to take interest in it, and concentrated upon it
        the unoccupied mass of desires which demanded satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had a ready appreciation of art, and probably, with a taste for
        imitating art, he supposed himself to have the real thing essential for
        an artist, and after hesitating for some time which style of painting to
        select&mdash;religious, historical, realistic, or genre
        painting&mdash;he set to work to paint. He appreciated all kinds, and
        could have felt inspired by anyone of them; but he had no conception of
        the possibility of knowing nothing at all of any school of painting, and
        of being inspired directly by what is within the soul, without caring
        whether what is painted will belong to any recognized school. Since he
        knew nothing of this, and drew his inspiration, not directly from life,
        but indirectly from life embodied in art, his inspiration came very
        quickly and easily, and as quickly and easily came his success in
        painting something very similar to the sort of painting he was trying to
        imitate.
      </p>

      <p>
        More than any other style he liked the French&mdash;graceful and
        effective&mdash;and in that style he began to paint Anna&rsquo;s
        portrait in Italian costume, and the portrait seemed to him, and to
        everyone who saw it, extremely successful.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 9</h3>

      <p>
        The old neglected palazzo, with its lofty carved ceilings and frescoes
        on the walls, with its floors of mosaic, with its heavy yellow stuff
        curtains on the windows, with its vases on pedestals, and its open
        fireplaces, its carved doors and gloomy reception rooms, hung with
        pictures&mdash;this palazzo did much, by its very appearance after they
        had moved into it, to confirm in Vronsky the agreeable illusion that he
        was not so much a Russian country gentleman, a retired army officer, as
        an enlightened amateur and patron of the arts, himself a modest artist
        who had renounced the world, his connections, and his ambition for the
        sake of the woman he loved.
      </p>

      <p>
        The pose chosen by Vronsky with their removal into the palazzo was
        completely successful, and having, through Golenishtchev, made
        acquaintance with a few interesting people, for a time he was satisfied.
        He painted studies from nature under the guidance of an Italian
        professor of painting, and studied mediæval Italian life. Mediæval
        Italian life so fascinated Vronsky that he even wore a hat and flung a
        cloak over his shoulder in the mediæval style, which, indeed, was
        extremely becoming to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here we live, and know nothing of what&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo;
        Vronsky said to Golenishtchev as he came to see him one morning.
        &ldquo;Have you seen Mihailov&rsquo;s picture?&rdquo; he said, handing
        him a Russian gazette he had received that morning, and pointing to an
        article on a Russian artist, living in the very same town, and just
        finishing a picture which had long been talked about, and had been
        bought beforehand. The article reproached the government and the academy
        for letting so remarkable an artist be left without encouragement and
        support.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it,&rdquo; answered Golenishtchev. &ldquo;Of
        course, he&rsquo;s not without talent, but it&rsquo;s all in a wrong
        direction. It&rsquo;s all the Ivanov-Strauss-Renan attitude to Christ
        and to religious painting.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the subject of the picture?&rdquo; asked Anna.

      <p>
        &ldquo;Christ before Pilate. Christ is represented as a Jew with all the
        realism of the new school.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And the question of the subject of the picture having brought him to one
        of his favorite theories, Golenishtchev launched forth into a
        disquisition on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand how they can fall into such a gross
        mistake. Christ always has His definite embodiment in the art of the
        great masters. And therefore, if they want to depict, not God, but a
        revolutionist or a sage, let them take from history a Socrates, a
        Franklin, a Charlotte Corday, but not Christ. They take the very figure
        which cannot be taken for their art, and then....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And is it true that this Mihailov is in such poverty?&rdquo;
        asked Vronsky, thinking that, as a Russian Mæcenas, it was his duty to
        assist the artist regardless of whether the picture were good or bad.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I should say not. He&rsquo;s a remarkable portrait-painter. Have
        you ever seen his portrait of Madame Vassiltchikova? But I believe he
        doesn&rsquo;t care about painting any more portraits, and so very likely
        he is in want. I maintain that....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we ask him to paint a portrait of Anna
        Arkadyevna?&rdquo; said Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why mine?&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;After yours I don&rsquo;t want
        another portrait. Better have one of Annie&rdquo; (so she called her
        baby girl). &ldquo;Here she is,&rdquo; she added, looking out of the
        window at the handsome Italian nurse, who was carrying the child out
        into the garden, and immediately glancing unnoticed at Vronsky. The
        handsome nurse, from whom Vronsky was painting a head for his picture,
        was the one hidden grief in Anna&rsquo;s life. He painted with her as
        his model, admired her beauty and mediævalism, and Anna dared not
        confess to herself that she was afraid of becoming jealous of this
        nurse, and was for that reason particularly gracious and condescending
        both to her and her little son. Vronsky, too, glanced out of the window
        and into Anna&rsquo;s eyes, and, turning at once to Golenishtchev, he
        said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know this Mihailov?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have met him. But he&rsquo;s a queer fish, and quite without
        breeding. You know, one of those uncouth new people one&rsquo;s so often
        coming across nowadays, one of those free-thinkers you know, who are
        reared
        <i>d&rsquo;emblée</i> in theories of atheism, scepticism, and
        materialism. In former days,&rdquo; said Golenishtchev, not observing,
        or not willing to observe, that both Anna and Vronsky wanted to speak,
        &ldquo;in former days the free-thinker was a man who had been brought up
        in ideas of religion, law, and morality, and only through conflict and
        struggle came to free-thought; but now there has sprung up a new type of
        born free-thinkers who grow up without even having heard of principles
        of morality or of religion, of the existence of authorities, who grow up
        directly in ideas of negation in everything, that is to say, savages.
        Well, he&rsquo;s of that class. He&rsquo;s the son, it appears, of some
        Moscow butler, and has never had any sort of bringing-up. When he got
        into the academy and made his reputation he tried, as he&rsquo;s no
        fool, to educate himself. And he turned to what seemed to him the very
        source of culture&mdash;the magazines. In old times, you see, a man who
        wanted to educate himself&mdash;a Frenchman, for instance&mdash;would
        have set to work to study all the classics and theologians and
        tragedians and historians and philosophers, and, you know, all the
        intellectual work that came in his way. But in our day he goes straight
        for the literature of negation, very quickly assimilates all the
        extracts of the science of negation, and he&rsquo;s ready. And
        that&rsquo;s not all&mdash;twenty years ago he would have found in that
        literature traces of conflict with authorities, with the creeds of the
        ages; he would have perceived from this conflict that there was
        something else; but now he comes at once upon a literature in which the
        old creeds do not even furnish matter for discussion, but it is stated
        baldly that there is nothing else&mdash;evolution, natural selection,
        struggle for existence&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all. In my article
        I&rsquo;ve....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you what,&rdquo; said Anna, who had for a long while been
        exchanging wary glances with Vronsky, and knew that he was not in the
        least interested in the education of this artist, but was simply
        absorbed by the idea of assisting him, and ordering a portrait of him;
        &ldquo;I tell you what,&rdquo; she said, resolutely interrupting
        Golenishtchev, who was still talking away, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go and see
        him!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Golenishtchev recovered his self-possession and readily agreed. But as
        the artist lived in a remote suburb, it was decided to take the
        carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        An hour later Anna, with Golenishtchev by her side and Vronsky on the
        front seat of the carriage, facing them, drove up to a new ugly house in
        the remote suburb. On learning from the porter&rsquo;s wife, who came
        out to them, that Mihailov saw visitors at his studio, but that at that
        moment he was in his lodging only a couple of steps off, they sent her
        to him with their cards, asking permission to see his picture.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 10</h3>

      <p>
        The artist Mihailov was, as always, at work when the cards of Count
        Vronsky and Golenishtchev were brought to him. In the morning he had
        been working in his studio at his big picture. On getting home he flew
        into a rage with his wife for not having managed to put off the
        landlady, who had been asking for money.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said it to you twenty times, don&rsquo;t enter into
        details. You&rsquo;re fool enough at all times, and when you start
        explaining things in Italian you&rsquo;re a fool three times as
        foolish,&rdquo; he said after a long dispute.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it run so long; it&rsquo;s not my fault. If I had
        the money....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Leave me in peace, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; Mihailov
        shrieked, with tears in his voice, and, stopping his ears, he went off
        into his working room, the other side of a partition wall, and closed
        the door after him. &ldquo;Idiotic woman!&rdquo; he said to himself, sat
        down to the table, and, opening a portfolio, he set to work at once with
        peculiar fervor at a sketch he had begun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Never did he work with such fervor and success as when things went ill
        with him, and especially when he quarreled with his wife. &ldquo;Oh!
        damn them all!&rdquo; he thought as he went on working. He was making a
        sketch for the figure of a man in a violent rage. A sketch had been made
        before, but he was dissatisfied with it. &ldquo;No, that one was better
        ... where is it?&rdquo; He went back to his wife, and scowling, and not
        looking at her, asked his eldest little girl, where was that piece of
        paper he had given them? The paper with the discarded sketch on it was
        found, but it was dirty, and spotted with candle-grease. Still, he took
        the sketch, laid it on his table, and, moving a little away, screwing up
        his eyes, he fell to gazing at it. All at once he smiled and
        gesticulated gleefully.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; he said, and, at once
        picking up the pencil, he began rapidly drawing. The spot of tallow had
        given the man a new pose.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had sketched this new pose, when all at once he recalled the face of
        a shopkeeper of whom he had bought cigars, a vigorous face with a
        prominent chin, and he sketched this very face, this chin on to the
        figure of the man. He laughed aloud with delight. The figure from a
        lifeless imagined thing had become living, and such that it could never
        be changed. That figure lived, and was clearly and unmistakably defined.
        The sketch might be corrected in accordance with the requirements of the
        figure, the legs, indeed, could and must be put differently, and the
        position of the left hand must be quite altered; the hair too might be
        thrown back. But in making these corrections he was not altering the
        figure but simply getting rid of what concealed the figure. He was, as
        it were, stripping off the wrappings which hindered it from being
        distinctly seen. Each new feature only brought out the whole figure in
        all its force and vigor, as it had suddenly come to him from the spot of
        tallow. He was carefully finishing the figure when the cards were
        brought him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Coming, coming!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He went in to his wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, Sasha, don&rsquo;t be cross!&rdquo; he said, smiling
        timidly and affectionately at her. &ldquo;You were to blame. I was to
        blame. I&rsquo;ll make it all right.&rdquo; And having made peace with
        his wife he put on an olive-green overcoat with a velvet collar and a
        hat, and went towards his studio. The successful figure he had already
        forgotten. Now he was delighted and excited at the visit of these people
        of consequence, Russians, who had come in their carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of his picture, the one that stood now on his easel, he had at the
        bottom of his heart one conviction&mdash;that no one had ever painted a
        picture like it. He did not believe that his picture was better than all
        the pictures of Raphael, but he knew that what he tried to convey in
        that picture, no one ever had conveyed. This he knew positively, and had
        known a long while, ever since he had begun to paint it. But other
        people&rsquo;s criticisms, whatever they might be, had yet immense
        consequence in his eyes, and they agitated him to the depths of his
        soul. Any remark, the most insignificant, that showed that the critic
        saw even the tiniest part of what he saw in the picture, agitated him to
        the depths of his soul. He always attributed to his critics a more
        profound comprehension than he had himself, and always expected from
        them something he did not himself see in the picture. And often in their
        criticisms he fancied that he had found this.
      </p>

      <p>
        He walked rapidly to the door of his studio, and in spite of his
        excitement he was struck by the soft light on Anna&rsquo;s figure as she
        stood in the shade of the entrance listening to Golenishtchev, who was
        eagerly telling her something, while she evidently wanted to look round
        at the artist. He was himself unconscious how, as he approached them, he
        seized on this impression and absorbed it, as he had the chin of the
        shopkeeper who had sold him the cigars, and put it away somewhere to be
        brought out when he wanted it. The visitors, not agreeably impressed
        beforehand by Golenishtchev&rsquo;s account of the artist, were still
        less so by his personal appearance. Thick-set and of middle height, with
        nimble movements, with his brown hat, olive-green coat and narrow
        trousers&mdash;though wide trousers had been a long while in
        fashion,&mdash;most of all, with the ordinariness of his broad face, and
        the combined expression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity,
        Mihailov made an unpleasant impression.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Please step in,&rdquo; he said, trying to look indifferent, and
        going into the passage he took a key out of his pocket and opened the
        door.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 11</h3>

      <p>
        On entering the studio, Mihailov once more scanned his visitors and
        noted down in his imagination Vronsky&rsquo;s expression too, and
        especially his jaws. Although his artistic sense was unceasingly at work
        collecting materials, although he felt a continually increasing
        excitement as the moment of criticizing his work drew nearer, he rapidly
        and subtly formed, from imperceptible signs, a mental image of these
        three persons.
      </p>

      <p>
        That fellow (Golenishtchev) was a Russian living here. Mihailov did not
        remember his surname nor where he had met him, nor what he had said to
        him. He only remembered his face as he remembered all the faces he had
        ever seen; but he remembered, too, that it was one of the faces laid by
        in his memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and poor
        in expression. The abundant hair and very open forehead gave an
        appearance of consequence to the face, which had only one
        expression&mdash;a petty, childish, peevish expression, concentrated
        just above the bridge of the narrow nose. Vronsky and Madame Karenina
        must be, Mihailov supposed, distinguished and wealthy Russians, knowing
        nothing about art, like all those wealthy Russians, but posing as
        amateurs and connoisseurs. &ldquo;Most likely they&rsquo;ve already
        looked at all the antiques, and now they&rsquo;re making the round of
        the studios of the new people, the German humbug, and the cracked
        Pre-Raphaelite English fellow, and have only come to me to make the
        point of view complete,&rdquo; he thought. He was well acquainted with
        the way dilettanti have (the cleverer they were the worse he found them)
        of looking at the works of contemporary artists with the sole object of
        being in a position to say that art is a thing of the past, and that the
        more one sees of the new men the more one sees how inimitable the works
        of the great old masters have remained. He expected all this; he saw it
        all in their faces, he saw it in the careless indifference with which
        they talked among themselves, stared at the lay figures and busts, and
        walked about in leisurely fashion, waiting for him to uncover his
        picture. But in spite of this, while he was turning over his studies,
        pulling up the blinds and taking off the sheet, he was in intense
        excitement, especially as, in spite of his conviction that all
        distinguished and wealthy Russians were certain to be beasts and fools,
        he liked Vronsky, and still more Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here, if you please,&rdquo; he said, moving on one side with his
        nimble gait and pointing to his picture, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the
        exhortation to Pilate. Matthew, chapter xxvii,&rdquo; he said, feeling
        his lips were beginning to tremble with emotion. He moved away and stood
        behind them.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the few seconds during which the visitors were gazing at the picture
        in silence Mihailov too gazed at it with the indifferent eye of an
        outsider. For those few seconds he was sure in anticipation that a
        higher, juster criticism would be uttered by them, by those very
        visitors whom he had been so despising a moment before. He forgot all he
        had thought about his picture before during the three years he had been
        painting it; he forgot all its qualities which had been absolutely
        certain to him&mdash;he saw the picture with their indifferent, new,
        outside eyes, and saw nothing good in it. He saw in the foreground
        Pilate&rsquo;s irritated face and the serene face of Christ, and in the
        background the figures of Pilate&rsquo;s retinue and the face of John
        watching what was happening. Every face that, with such agony, such
        blunders and corrections had grown up within him with its special
        character, every face that had given him such torments and such
        raptures, and all these faces so many times transposed for the sake of
        the harmony of the whole, all the shades of color and tones that he had
        attained with such labor&mdash;all of this together seemed to him now,
        looking at it with their eyes, the merest vulgarity, something that had
        been done a thousand times over. The face dearest to him, the face of
        Christ, the center of the picture, which had given him such ecstasy as
        it unfolded itself to him, was utterly lost to him when he glanced at
        the picture with their eyes. He saw a well-painted (no, not even
        that&mdash;he distinctly saw now a mass of defects) repetition of those
        endless Christs of Titian, Raphael, Rubens, and the same soldiers and
        Pilate. It was all common, poor, and stale, and positively badly
        painted&mdash;weak and unequal. They would be justified in repeating
        hypocritically civil speeches in the presence of the painter, and
        pitying him and laughing at him when they were alone again.
      </p>

      <p>
        The silence (though it lasted no more than a minute) became too
        intolerable to him. To break it, and to show he was not agitated, he
        made an effort and addressed Golenishtchev.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of meeting you,&rdquo; he
        said, looking uneasily first at Anna, then at Vronsky, in fear of losing
        any shade of their expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To be sure! We met at Rossi&rsquo;s, do you remember, at that
        <i>soirée</i> when that Italian lady recited&mdash;the new
        Rachel?&rdquo; Golenishtchev answered easily, removing his eyes without
        the slightest regret from the picture and turning to the artist.
      </p>

      <p>
        Noticing, however, that Mihailov was expecting a criticism of the
        picture, he said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Your picture has got on a great deal since I saw it last time;
        and what strikes me particularly now, as it did then, is the figure of
        Pilate. One so knows the man: a good-natured, capital fellow, but an
        official through and through, who does not know what it is he&rsquo;s
        doing. But I fancy....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        All Mihailov&rsquo;s mobile face beamed at once; his eyes sparkled. He
        tried to say something, but he could not speak for excitement, and
        pretended to be coughing. Low as was his opinion of
        Golenishtchev&rsquo;s capacity for understanding art, trifling as was
        the true remark upon the fidelity of the expression of Pilate as an
        official, and offensive as might have seemed the utterance of so
        unimportant an observation while nothing was said of more serious
        points, Mihailov was in an ecstasy of delight at this observation. He
        had himself thought about Pilate&rsquo;s figure just what Golenishtchev
        said. The fact that this reflection was but one of millions of
        reflections, which as Mihailov knew for certain would be true, did not
        diminish for him the significance of Golenishtchev&rsquo;s remark. His
        heart warmed to Golenishtchev for this remark, and from a state of
        depression he suddenly passed to ecstasy. At once the whole of his
        picture lived before him in all the indescribable complexity of
        everything living. Mihailov again tried to say that that was how he
        understood Pilate, but his lips quivered intractably, and he could not
        pronounce the words. Vronsky and Anna too said something in that subdued
        voice in which, partly to avoid hurting the artist&rsquo;s feelings and
        partly to avoid saying out loud something silly&mdash;so easily said
        when talking of art&mdash;people usually speak at exhibitions of
        pictures. Mihailov fancied that the picture had made an impression on
        them too. He went up to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How marvelous Christ&rsquo;s expression is!&rdquo; said Anna. Of
        all she saw she liked that expression most of all, and she felt that it
        was the center of the picture, and so praise of it would be pleasant to
        the artist. &ldquo;One can see that He is pitying Pilate.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This again was one of the million true reflections that could be found
        in his picture and in the figure of Christ. She said that He was pitying
        Pilate. In Christ&rsquo;s expression there ought to be indeed an
        expression of pity, since there is an expression of love, of heavenly
        peace, of readiness for death, and a sense of the vanity of words. Of
        course there is the expression of an official in Pilate and of pity in
        Christ, seeing that one is the incarnation of the fleshly and the other
        of the spiritual life. All this and much more flashed into
        Mihailov&rsquo;s thoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, and how that figure is done&mdash;what atmosphere! One can
        walk round it,&rdquo; said Golenishtchev, unmistakably betraying by this
        remark that he did not approve of the meaning and idea of the figure.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a wonderful mastery!&rdquo; said Vronsky.
        &ldquo;How those figures in the background stand out! There you have
        technique,&rdquo; he said, addressing Golenishtchev, alluding to a
        conversation between them about Vronsky&rsquo;s despair of attaining
        this technique.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, marvelous!&rdquo; Golenishtchev and Anna assented. In
        spite of the excited condition in which he was, the sentence about
        technique had sent a pang to Mihailov&rsquo;s heart, and looking angrily
        at Vronsky he suddenly scowled. He had often heard this word technique,
        and was utterly unable to understand what was understood by it. He knew
        that by this term was understood a mechanical facility for painting or
        drawing, entirely apart from its subject. He had noticed often that even
        in actual praise technique was opposed to essential quality, as though
        one could paint well something that was bad. He knew that a great deal
        of attention and care was necessary in taking off the coverings, to
        avoid injuring the creation itself, and to take off all the coverings;
        but there was no art of painting&mdash;no technique of any
        sort&mdash;about it. If to a little child or to his cook were revealed
        what he saw, it or she would have been able to peel the wrappings off
        what was seen. And the most experienced and adroit painter could not by
        mere mechanical facility paint anything if the lines of the subject were
        not revealed to him first. Besides, he saw that if it came to talking
        about technique, it was impossible to praise him for it. In all he had
        painted and repainted he saw faults that hurt his eyes, coming from want
        of care in taking off the wrappings&mdash;faults he could not correct
        now without spoiling the whole. And in almost all the figures and faces
        he saw, too, remnants of the wrappings not perfectly removed that
        spoiled the picture.

      <p>
        &ldquo;One thing might be said, if you will allow me to make the
        remark....&rdquo; observed Golenishtchev.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I shall be delighted, I beg you,&rdquo; said Mihailov with a
        forced smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That is, that you make Him the man-god, and not the God-man. But
        I know that was what you meant to do.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot paint a Christ that is not in my heart,&rdquo; said
        Mihailov gloomily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but in that case, if you will allow me to say what I
        think.... Your picture is so fine that my observation cannot detract
        from it, and, besides, it is only my personal opinion. With you it is
        different. Your very motive is different. But let us take Ivanov. I
        imagine that if Christ is brought down to the level of an historical
        character, it would have been better for Ivanov to select some other
        historical subject, fresh, untouched.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But if this is the greatest subject presented to art?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If one looked one would find others. But the point is that art
        cannot suffer doubt and discussion. And before the picture of Ivanov the
        question arises for the believer and the unbeliever alike, &lsquo;Is it
        God, or is it not God?&rsquo; and the unity of the impression is
        destroyed.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so? I think that for educated people,&rdquo; said Mihailov,
        &ldquo;the question cannot exist.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Golenishtchev did not agree with this, and confounded Mihailov by his
        support of his first idea of the unity of the impression being essential
        to art.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mihailov was greatly perturbed, but he could say nothing in defense of
        his own idea.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 12</h3>

      <p>
        Anna and Vronsky had long been exchanging glances, regretting their
        friend&rsquo;s flow of cleverness. At last Vronsky, without waiting for
        the artist, walked away to another small picture.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, how exquisite! What a lovely thing! A gem! How
        exquisite!&rdquo; they cried with one voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it they&rsquo;re so pleased with?&rdquo; thought
        Mihailov. He had positively forgotten that picture he had painted three
        years ago. He had forgotten all the agonies and the ecstasies he had
        lived through with that picture when for several months it had been the
        one thought haunting him day and night. He had forgotten, as he always
        forgot, the pictures he had finished. He did not even like to look at
        it, and had only brought it out because he was expecting an Englishman
        who wanted to buy it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s only an old study,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How fine!&rdquo; said Golenishtchev, he too, with unmistakable
        sincerity, falling under the spell of the picture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two boys were angling in the shade of a willow-tree. The elder had just
        dropped in the hook, and was carefully pulling the float from behind a
        bush, entirely absorbed in what he was doing. The other, a little
        younger, was lying in the grass leaning on his elbows, with his tangled,
        flaxen head in his hands, staring at the water with his dreamy blue
        eyes. What was he thinking of?
      </p>

      <p>
        The enthusiasm over this picture stirred some of the old feeling for it
        in Mihailov, but he feared and disliked this waste of feeling for things
        past, and so, even though this praise was grateful to him, he tried to
        draw his visitors away to a third picture.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Vronsky asked whether the picture was for sale. To Mihailov at that
        moment, excited by visitors, it was extremely distasteful to speak of
        money matters.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It is put up there to be sold,&rdquo; he answered, scowling
        gloomily.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the visitors had gone, Mihailov sat down opposite the picture of
        Pilate and Christ, and in his mind went over what had been said, and
        what, though not said, had been implied by those visitors. And, strange
        to say, what had had such weight with him, while they were there and
        while he mentally put himself at their point of view, suddenly lost all
        importance for him. He began to look at his picture with all his own
        full artist vision, and was soon in that mood of conviction of the
        perfectibility, and so of the significance, of his picture&mdash;a
        conviction essential to the most intense fervor, excluding all other
        interests&mdash;in which alone he could work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Christ&rsquo;s foreshortened leg was not right, though. He took his
        palette and began to work. As he corrected the leg he looked continually
        at the figure of John in the background, which his visitors had not even
        noticed, but which he knew was beyond perfection. When he had finished
        the leg he wanted to touch that figure, but he felt too much excited for
        it. He was equally unable to work when he was cold and when he was too
        much affected and saw everything too much. There was only one stage in
        the transition from coldness to inspiration, at which work was possible.
        Today he was too much agitated. He would have covered the picture, but
        he stopped, holding the cloth in his hand, and, smiling blissfully,
        gazed a long while at the figure of John. At last, as it were
        regretfully tearing himself away, he dropped the cloth, and, exhausted
        but happy, went home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky, Anna, and Golenishtchev, on their way home, were particularly
        lively and cheerful. They talked of Mihailov and his pictures. The word
        <i>talent</i>, by which they meant an inborn, almost physical, aptitude
        apart from brain and heart, and in which they tried to find an
        expression for all the artist had gained from life, recurred
        particularly often in their talk, as though it were necessary for them
        to sum up what they had no conception of, though they wanted to talk of
        it. They said that there was no denying his talent, but that his talent
        could not develop for want of education&mdash;the common defect of our
        Russian artists. But the picture of the boys had imprinted itself on
        their memories, and they were continually coming back to it. &ldquo;What
        an exquisite thing! How he has succeeded in it, and how simply! He
        doesn&rsquo;t even comprehend how good it is. Yes, I mustn&rsquo;t let
        it slip; I must buy it,&rdquo; said Vronsky.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 13</h3>

      <p>
        Mihailov sold Vronsky his picture, and agreed to paint a portrait of
        Anna. On the day fixed he came and began the work.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the fifth sitting the portrait impressed everyone, especially
        Vronsky, not only by its resemblance, but by its characteristic beauty.
        It was strange how Mihailov could have discovered just her
        characteristic beauty. &ldquo;One needs to know and love her as I have
        loved her to discover the very sweetest expression of her soul,&rdquo;
        Vronsky thought, though it was only from this portrait that he had
        himself learned this sweetest expression of her soul. But the expression
        was so true that he, and others too, fancied they had long known it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have been struggling on for ever so long without doing
        anything,&rdquo; he said of his own portrait of her, &ldquo;and he just
        looked and painted it. That&rsquo;s where technique comes in.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That will come,&rdquo; was the consoling reassurance given him by
        Golenishtchev, in whose view Vronsky had both talent, and what was most
        important, culture, giving him a wider outlook on art.
        Golenishtchev&rsquo;s faith in Vronsky&rsquo;s talent was propped up by
        his own need of Vronsky&rsquo;s sympathy and approval for his own
        articles and ideas, and he felt that the praise and support must be
        mutual.
      </p>

      <p>
        In another man&rsquo;s house, and especially in Vronsky&rsquo;s palazzo,
        Mihailov was quite a different man from what he was in his studio. He
        behaved with hostile courtesy, as though he were afraid of coming closer
        to people he did not respect. He called Vronsky &ldquo;your
        excellency,&rdquo; and notwithstanding Anna&rsquo;s and Vronsky&rsquo;s
        invitations, he would never stay to dinner, nor come except for the
        sittings. Anna was even more friendly to him than to other people, and
        was very grateful for her portrait. Vronsky was more than cordial with
        him, and was obviously interested to know the artist&rsquo;s opinion of
        his picture. Golenishtchev never let slip an opportunity of instilling
        sound ideas about art into Mihailov. But Mihailov remained equally
        chilly to all of them. Anna was aware from his eyes that he liked
        looking at her, but he avoided conversation with her. Vronsky&rsquo;s
        talk about his painting he met with stubborn silence, and he was as
        stubbornly silent when he was shown Vronsky&rsquo;s picture. He was
        unmistakably bored by Golenishtchev&rsquo;s conversation, and he did not
        attempt to oppose him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Altogether Mihailov, with his reserved and disagreeable, as it were,
        hostile attitude, was quite disliked by them as they got to know him
        better; and they were glad when the sittings were over, and they were
        left with a magnificent portrait in their possession, and he gave up
        coming. Golenishtchev was the first to give expression to an idea that
        had occurred to all of them, which was that Mihailov was simply jealous
        of Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not envious, let us say, since he has <i>talent</i>; but it
        annoys him that a wealthy man of the highest society, and a count, too
        (you know they all detest a title), can, without any particular trouble,
        do as well, if not better, than he who has devoted all his life to it.
        And more than all, it&rsquo;s a question of culture, which he is
        without.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky defended Mihailov, but at the bottom of his heart he believed
        it, because in his view a man of a different, lower world would be sure
        to be envious.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna&rsquo;s portrait&mdash;the same subject painted from nature both by
        him and by Mihailov&mdash;ought to have shown Vronsky the difference
        between him and Mihailov; but he did not see it. Only after
        Mihailov&rsquo;s portrait was painted he left off painting his portrait
        of Anna, deciding that it was now not needed. His picture of mediæval
        life he went on with. And he himself, and Golenishtchev, and still more
        Anna, thought it very good, because it was far more like the celebrated
        pictures they knew than Mihailov&rsquo;s picture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mihailov meanwhile, although Anna&rsquo;s portrait greatly fascinated
        him, was even more glad than they were when the sittings were over, and
        he had no longer to listen to Golenishtchev&rsquo;s disquisitions upon
        art, and could forget about Vronsky&rsquo;s painting. He knew that
        Vronsky could not be prevented from amusing himself with painting; he
        knew that he and all dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they
        liked, but it was distasteful to him. A man could not be prevented from
        making himself a big wax doll, and kissing it. But if the man were to
        come with the doll and sit before a man in love, and begin caressing his
        doll as the lover caressed the woman he loved, it would be distasteful
        to the lover. Just such a distasteful sensation was what Mihailov felt
        at the sight of Vronsky&rsquo;s painting: he felt it both ludicrous and
        irritating, both pitiable and offensive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky&rsquo;s interest in painting and the Middle Ages did not last
        long. He had enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his
        picture. The picture came to a standstill. He was vaguely aware that its
        defects, inconspicuous at first, would be glaring if he were to go on
        with it. The same experience befell him as Golenishtchev, who felt that
        he had nothing to say, and continually deceived himself with the theory
        that his idea was not yet mature, that he was working it out and
        collecting materials. This exasperated and tortured Golenishtchev, but
        Vronsky was incapable of deceiving and torturing himself, and even more
        incapable of exasperation. With his characteristic decision, without
        explanation or apology, he simply ceased working at painting.
      </p>

      <p>
        But without this occupation, the life of Vronsky and of Anna, who
        wondered at his loss of interest in it, struck them as intolerably
        tedious in an Italian town. The palazzo suddenly seemed so obtrusively
        old and dirty, the spots on the curtains, the cracks in the floors, the
        broken plaster on the cornices became so disagreeably obvious, and the
        everlasting sameness of Golenishtchev, and the Italian professor and the
        German traveler became so wearisome, that they had to make some change.
        They resolved to go to Russia, to the country. In Petersburg Vronsky
        intended to arrange a partition of the land with his brother, while Anna
        meant to see her son. The summer they intended to spend on
        Vronsky&rsquo;s great family estate.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 14</h3>

      <p>
        Levin had been married three months. He was happy, but not at all in the
        way he had expected to be. At every step he found his former dreams
        disappointed, and new, unexpected surprises of happiness. He was happy;
        but on entering upon family life he saw at every step that it was
        utterly different from what he had imagined. At every step he
        experienced what a man would experience who, after admiring the smooth,
        happy course of a little boat on a lake, should get himself into that
        little boat. He saw that it was not all sitting still, floating
        smoothly; that one had to think too, not for an instant to forget where
        one was floating; and that there was water under one, and that one must
        row; and that his unaccustomed hands would be sore; and that it was only
        to look at it that was easy; but that doing it, though very delightful,
        was very difficult.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a bachelor, when he had watched other people&rsquo;s married life,
        seen the petty cares, the squabbles, the jealousy, he had only smiled
        contemptuously in his heart. In his future married life there could be,
        he was convinced, nothing of that sort; even the external forms, indeed,
        he fancied, must be utterly unlike the life of others in everything. And
        all of a sudden, instead of his life with his wife being made on an
        individual pattern, it was, on the contrary, entirely made up of the
        pettiest details, which he had so despised before, but which now, by no
        will of his own, had gained an extraordinary importance that it was
        useless to contend against. And Levin saw that the organization of all
        these details was by no means so easy as he had fancied before. Although
        Levin believed himself to have the most exact conceptions of domestic
        life, unconsciously, like all men, he pictured domestic life as the
        happiest enjoyment of love, with nothing to hinder and no petty cares to
        distract. He ought, as he conceived the position, to do his work, and to
        find repose from it in the happiness of love. She ought to be beloved,
        and nothing more. But, like all men, he forgot that she too would want
        work. And he was surprised that she, his poetic, exquisite Kitty, could,
        not merely in the first weeks, but even in the first days of their
        married life, think, remember, and busy herself about tablecloths, and
        furniture, about mattresses for visitors, about a tray, about the cook,
        and the dinner, and so on. While they were still engaged, he had been
        struck by the definiteness with which she had declined the tour abroad
        and decided to go into the country, as though she knew of something she
        wanted, and could still think of something outside her love. This had
        jarred upon him then, and now her trivial cares and anxieties jarred
        upon him several times. But he saw that this was essential for her. And,
        loving her as he did, though he did not understand the reason of them,
        and jeered at these domestic pursuits, he could not help admiring them.
        He jeered at the way in which she arranged the furniture they had
        brought from Moscow; rearranged their room; hung up curtains; prepared
        rooms for visitors; a room for Dolly; saw after an abode for her new
        maid; ordered dinner of the old cook; came into collision with Agafea
        Mihalovna, taking from her the charge of the stores. He saw how the old
        cook smiled, admiring her, and listening to her inexperienced,
        impossible orders, how mournfully and tenderly Agafea Mihalovna shook
        her head over the young mistress&rsquo;s new arrangements. He saw that
        Kitty was extraordinarily sweet when, laughing and crying, she came to
        tell him that her maid, Masha, was used to looking upon her as her young
        lady, and so no one obeyed her. It seemed to him sweet, but strange, and
        he thought it would have been better without this.
      </p>

      <p>
        He did not know how great a sense of change she was experiencing; she,
        who at home had sometimes wanted some favorite dish, or sweets, without
        the possibility of getting either, now could order what she liked, buy
        pounds of sweets, spend as much money as she liked, and order any
        puddings she pleased.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was dreaming with delight now of Dolly&rsquo;s coming to them with
        her children, especially because she would order for the children their
        favorite puddings and Dolly would appreciate all her new housekeeping.
        She did not know herself why and wherefore, but the arranging of her
        house had an irresistible attraction for her. Instinctively feeling the
        approach of spring, and knowing that there would be days of rough
        weather too, she built her nest as best she could, and was in haste at
        the same time to build it and to learn how to do it.
      </p>

      <p>
        This care for domestic details in Kitty, so opposed to Levin&rsquo;s
        ideal of exalted happiness, was at first one of the disappointments; and
        this sweet care of her household, the aim of which he did not
        understand, but could not help loving, was one of the new happy
        surprises.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another disappointment and happy surprise came in their quarrels. Levin
        could never have conceived that between him and his wife any relations
        could arise other than tender, respectful and loving, and all at once in
        the very early days they quarreled, so that she said he did not care for
        her, that he cared for no one but himself, burst into tears, and wrung
        her arms.
      </p>

      <p>
        This first quarrel arose from Levin&rsquo;s having gone out to a new
        farmhouse and having been away half an hour too long, because he had
        tried to get home by a short cut and had lost his way. He drove home
        thinking of nothing but her, of her love, of his own happiness, and the
        nearer he drew to home, the warmer was his tenderness for her. He ran
        into the room with the same feeling, with an even stronger feeling than
        he had had when he reached the Shtcherbatskys&rsquo; house to make his
        offer. And suddenly he was met by a lowering expression he had never
        seen in her. He would have kissed her; she pushed him away.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been enjoying yourself,&rdquo; she began, trying to
        be calm and spiteful. But as soon as she opened her mouth, a stream of
        reproach, of senseless jealousy, of all that had been torturing her
        during that half hour which she had spent sitting motionless at the
        window, burst from her. It was only then, for the first time, that he
        clearly understood what he had not understood when he led her out of the
        church after the wedding. He felt now that he was not simply close to
        her, but that he did not know where he ended and she began. He felt this
        from the agonizing sensation of division that he experienced at that
        instant. He was offended for the first instant, but the very same second
        he felt that he could not be offended by her, that she was himself. He
        felt for the first moment as a man feels when, having suddenly received
        a violent blow from behind, he turns round, angry and eager to avenge
        himself, to look for his antagonist, and finds that it is he himself who
        has accidentally struck himself, that there is no one to be angry with,
        and that he must put up with and try to soothe the pain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Never afterwards did he feel it with such intensity, but this first time
        he could not for a long while get over it. His natural feeling urged him
        to defend himself, to prove to her she was wrong; but to prove her wrong
        would mean irritating her still more and making the rupture greater that
        was the cause of all his suffering. One habitual feeling impelled him to
        get rid of the blame and to pass it on to her. Another feeling, even
        stronger, impelled him as quickly as possible to smooth over the rupture
        without letting it grow greater. To remain under such undeserved
        reproach was wretched, but to make her suffer by justifying himself was
        worse still. Like a man half-awake in an agony of pain, he wanted to
        tear out, to fling away the aching place, and coming to his senses, he
        felt that the aching place was himself. He could do nothing but try to
        help the aching place to bear it, and this he tried to do.
      </p>

        They made peace. She, recognizing that she was wrong, though she did not
        say so, became tenderer to him, and they experienced new, redoubled
        happiness in their love. But that did not prevent such quarrels from
        happening again, and exceedingly often too, on the most unexpected and
        trivial grounds. These quarrels frequently arose from the fact that they
        did not yet know what was of importance to each other and that all this
        early period they were both often in a bad temper. When one was in a
        good temper, and the other in a bad temper, the peace was not broken;
        but when both happened to be in an ill-humor, quarrels sprang up from
        such incomprehensibly trifling causes, that they could never remember
        afterwards what they had quarreled about. It is true that when they were
        both in a good temper their enjoyment of life was redoubled. But still
        this first period of their married life was a difficult time for them.
      </p>

      <p>
        During all this early time they had a peculiarly vivid sense of tension,
        as it were, a tugging in opposite directions of the chain by which they
        were bound. Altogether their honeymoon&mdash;that is to say, the month
        after their wedding&mdash;from which from tradition Levin expected so
        much, was not merely not a time of sweetness, but remained in the
        memories of both as the bitterest and most humiliating period in their
        lives. They both alike tried in later life to blot out from their
        memories all the monstrous, shameful incidents of that morbid period,
        when both were rarely in a normal frame of mind, both were rarely quite
        themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was only in the third month of their married life, after their return
        from Moscow, where they had been staying for a month, that their life
        began to go more smoothly.

      <h3>Chapter 15</h3>

      <p>
        They had just come back from Moscow, and were glad to be alone. He was
        sitting at the writing-table in his study, writing. She, wearing the
        dark lilac dress she had worn during the first days of their married
        life, and put on again today, a dress particularly remembered and loved
        by him, was sitting on the sofa, the same old-fashioned leather sofa
        which had always stood in the study in Levin&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s and
        grandfather&rsquo;s days. She was sewing at
        <i>broderie anglaise</i>. He thought and wrote, never losing the happy
        consciousness of her presence. His work, both on the land and on the
        book, in which the principles of the new land system were to be laid
        down, had not been abandoned; but just as formerly these pursuits and
        ideas had seemed to him petty and trivial in comparison with the
        darkness that overspread all life, now they seemed as unimportant and
        petty in comparison with the life that lay before him suffused with the
        brilliant light of happiness. He went on with his work, but he felt now
        that the center of gravity of his attention had passed to something
        else, and that consequently he looked at his work quite differently and
        more clearly. Formerly this work had been for him an escape from life.
        Formerly he had felt that without this work his life would be too
        gloomy. Now these pursuits were necessary for him that life might not be
        too uniformly bright. Taking up his manuscript, reading through what he
        had written, he found with pleasure that the work was worth his working
        at. Many of his old ideas seemed to him superfluous and extreme, but
        many blanks became distinct to him when he reviewed the whole thing in
        his memory. He was writing now a new chapter on the causes of the
        present disastrous condition of agriculture in Russia. He maintained
        that the poverty of Russia arises not merely from the anomalous
        distribution of landed property and misdirected reforms, but that what
        had contributed of late years to this result was the civilization from
        without abnormally grafted upon Russia, especially facilities of
        communication, as railways, leading to centralization in towns, the
        development of luxury, and the consequent development of manufactures,
        credit and its accompaniment of speculation&mdash;all to the detriment
        of agriculture. It seemed to him that in a normal development of wealth
        in a state all these phenomena would arise only when a considerable
        amount of labor had been put into agriculture, when it had come under
        regular, or at least definite, conditions; that the wealth of a country
        ought to increase proportionally, and especially in such a way that
        other sources of wealth should not outstrip agriculture; that in harmony
        with a certain stage of agriculture there should be means of
        communication corresponding to it, and that in our unsettled condition
        of the land, railways, called into being by political and not by
        economic needs, were premature, and instead of promoting agriculture, as
        was expected of them, they were competing with agriculture and promoting
        the development of manufactures and credit, and so arresting its
        progress; and that just as the one-sided and premature development of
        one organ in an animal would hinder its general development, so in the
        general development of wealth in Russia, credit, facilities of
        communication, manufacturing activity, indubitably necessary in Europe,
        where they had arisen in their proper time, had with us only done harm,
        by throwing into the background the chief question calling for
        settlement&mdash;the question of the organization of agriculture.

      <p>
        While he was writing his ideas she was thinking how unnaturally cordial
        her husband had been to young Prince Tcharsky, who had, with great want
        of tact, flirted with her the day before they left Moscow.
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s jealous,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Goodness! how
        sweet and silly he is! He&rsquo;s jealous of me! If he knew that I think
        no more of them than of Piotr the cook,&rdquo; she thought, looking at
        his head and red neck with a feeling of possession strange to herself.
        &ldquo;Though it&rsquo;s a pity to take him from his work (but he has
        plenty of time!), I must look at his face; will he feel I&rsquo;m
        looking at him? I wish he&rsquo;d turn round ... I&rsquo;ll
        <i>will</i> him to!&rdquo; and she opened her eyes wide, as though to
        intensify the influence of her gaze.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, they draw away all the sap and give a false appearance of
        prosperity,&rdquo; he muttered, stopping to write, and, feeling that she
        was looking at him and smiling, he looked round.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he queried, smiling, and getting up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He looked round,&rdquo; she thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing; I wanted you to look round,&rdquo; she said,
        watching him, and trying to guess whether he was vexed at being
        interrupted or not.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How happy we are alone together!&mdash;I am, that is,&rdquo; he
        said, going up to her with a radiant smile of happiness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as happy. I&rsquo;ll never go anywhere, especially
        not to Moscow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And what were you thinking about?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I? I was thinking.... No, no, go along, go on writing;
        don&rsquo;t break off,&rdquo; she said, pursing up her lips, &ldquo;and
        I must cut out these little holes now, do you see?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She took up her scissors and began cutting them out.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; tell me, what was it?&rdquo; he said, sitting down beside her
        and watching the tiny scissors moving round.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! what was I thinking about? I was thinking about Moscow, about
        the back of your head.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why should I, of all people, have such happiness! It&rsquo;s
        unnatural, too good,&rdquo; he said, kissing her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I feel quite the opposite; the better things are, the more
        natural it seems to me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve got a little curl loose,&rdquo; he said,
        carefully turning her head round.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A little curl, oh yes. No, no, we are busy at our work!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Work did not progress further, and they darted apart from one another
        like culprits when Kouzma came in to announce that tea was ready.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Have they come from the town?&rdquo; Levin asked Kouzma.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve just come; they&rsquo;re unpacking the
        things.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come quickly,&rdquo; she said to him as she went out of the
        study, &ldquo;or else I shall read your letters without you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Left alone, after putting his manuscripts together in the new portfolio
        bought by her, he washed his hands at the new washstand with the elegant
        fittings, that had all made their appearance with her. Levin smiled at
        his own thoughts, and shook his head disapprovingly at those thoughts; a
        feeling akin to remorse fretted him. There was something shameful,
        effeminate, Capuan, as he called it to himself, in his present mode of
        life. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not right to go on like this,&rdquo; he thought.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll soon be three months, and I&rsquo;m doing next to
        nothing. Today, almost for the first time, I set to work seriously, and
        what happened? I did nothing but begin and throw it aside. Even my
        ordinary pursuits I have almost given up. On the land I scarcely walk or
        drive about at all to look after things. Either I am loath to leave her,
        or I see she&rsquo;s dull alone. And I used to think that, before
        marriage, life was nothing much, somehow didn&rsquo;t count, but that
        after marriage, life began in earnest. And here almost three months have
        passed, and I have spent my time so idly and unprofitably. No, this
        won&rsquo;t do; I must begin. Of course, it&rsquo;s not her fault.
        She&rsquo;s not to blame in any way. I ought myself to be firmer, to
        maintain my masculine independence of action; or else I shall get into
        such ways, and she&rsquo;ll get used to them too.... Of course
        she&rsquo;s not to blame,&rdquo; he told himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it is hard for anyone who is dissatisfied not to blame someone else,
        and especially the person nearest of all to him, for the ground of his
        dissatisfaction. And it vaguely came into Levin&rsquo;s mind that she
        herself was not to blame (she could not be to blame for anything), but
        what was to blame was her education, too superficial and frivolous.
        (&ldquo;That fool Tcharsky: she wanted, I know, to stop him, but
        didn&rsquo;t know how to.&rdquo;) &ldquo;Yes, apart from her interest in
        the house (that she has), apart from dress and <i>broderie anglaise</i>,
        she has no serious interests. No interest in her work, in the estate, in
        the peasants, nor in music, though she&rsquo;s rather good at it, nor in
        reading. She does nothing, and is perfectly satisfied.&rdquo; Levin, in
        his heart, censured this, and did not as yet understand that she was
        preparing for that period of activity which was to come for her when she
        would at once be the wife of her husband and mistress of the house, and
        would bear, and nurse, and bring up children. He knew not that she was
        instinctively aware of this, and preparing herself for this time of
        terrible toil, did not reproach herself for the moments of carelessness
        and happiness in her love that she enjoyed now while gaily building her
        nest for the future.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 16</h3>

      <p>
        When Levin went upstairs, his wife was sitting near the new silver
        samovar behind the new tea service, and, having settled old Agafea
        Mihalovna at a little table with a full cup of tea, was reading a letter
        from Dolly, with whom they were in continual and frequent
        correspondence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You see, your good lady&rsquo;s settled me here, told me to sit a
        bit with her,&rdquo; said Agafea Mihalovna, smiling affectionately at
        Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        In these words of Agafea Mihalovna, Levin read the final act of the
        drama which had been enacted of late between her and Kitty. He saw that,
        in spite of Agafea Mihalovna&rsquo;s feelings being hurt by a new
        mistress taking the reins of government out of her hands, Kitty had yet
        conquered her and made her love her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here, I opened your letter too,&rdquo; said Kitty, handing him an
        illiterate letter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from that woman, I think, your
        brother&rsquo;s....&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I did not read it through.
        This is from my people and from Dolly. Fancy! Dolly took Tanya and
        Grisha to a children&rsquo;s ball at the Sarmatskys&rsquo;: Tanya was a
        French marquise.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But Levin did not hear her. Flushing, he took the letter from Marya
        Nikolaevna, his brother&rsquo;s former mistress, and began to read it.
        This was the second letter he had received from Marya Nikolaevna. In the
        first letter, Marya Nikolaevna wrote that his brother had sent her away
        for no fault of hers, and, with touching simplicity, added that though
        she was in want again, she asked for nothing, and wished for nothing,
        but was only tormented by the thought that Nikolay Dmitrievitch would
        come to grief without her, owing to the weak state of his health, and
        begged his brother to look after him. Now she wrote quite differently.
        She had found Nikolay Dmitrievitch, had again made it up with him in
        Moscow, and had moved with him to a provincial town, where he had
        received a post in the government service. But that he had quarreled
        with the head official, and was on his way back to Moscow, only he had
        been taken so ill on the road that it was doubtful if he would ever
        leave his bed again, she wrote. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always of you he has
        talked, and, besides, he has no more money left.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Read this; Dolly writes about you,&rdquo; Kitty was beginning,
        with a smile; but she stopped suddenly, noticing the changed expression
        on her husband&rsquo;s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She writes to me that Nikolay, my brother, is at death&rsquo;s
        door. I shall go to him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty&rsquo;s face changed at once. Thoughts of Tanya as a marquise, of
        Dolly, all had vanished.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;When are you going?&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And I will go with you, can I?&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kitty! What are you thinking of?&rdquo; he said reproachfully.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; offended that he should seem to take her
        suggestion unwillingly and with vexation. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I
        go? I shan&rsquo;t be in your way. I....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going because my brother is dying,&rdquo; said Levin.
        &ldquo;Why should you....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why? For the same reason as you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And, at a moment of such gravity for me, she only thinks of her
        being dull by herself,&rdquo; thought Levin. And this lack of candor in
        a matter of such gravity infuriated him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s out of the question,&rdquo; he said sternly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Agafea Mihalovna, seeing that it was coming to a quarrel, gently put
        down her cup and withdrew. Kitty did not even notice her. The tone in
        which her husband had said the last words wounded her, especially
        because he evidently did not believe what she had said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you, that if you go, I shall come with you; I shall
        certainly come,&rdquo; she said hastily and wrathfully. &ldquo;Why out
        of the question? Why do you say it&rsquo;s out of the question?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;ll be going God knows where, by all sorts of
        roads and to all sorts of hotels. You would be a hindrance to me,&rdquo;
        said Levin, trying to be cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not at all. I don&rsquo;t want anything. Where you can go, I
        can....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, for one thing then, because this woman&rsquo;s there whom
        you can&rsquo;t meet.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know and don&rsquo;t care to know who&rsquo;s there
        and what. I know that my husband&rsquo;s brother is dying and my husband
        is going to him, and I go with my husband too....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kitty! Don&rsquo;t get angry. But just think a little: this is a
        matter of such importance that I can&rsquo;t bear to think that you
        should bring in a feeling of weakness, of dislike to being left alone.
        Come, you&rsquo;ll be dull alone, so go and stay at Moscow a
        little.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There, you always ascribe base, vile motives to me,&rdquo; she
        said with tears of wounded pride and fury. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean,
        it wasn&rsquo;t weakness, it wasn&rsquo;t ... I feel that it&rsquo;s my
        duty to be with my husband when he&rsquo;s in trouble, but you try on
        purpose to hurt me, you try on purpose not to understand....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; this is awful! To be such a slave!&rdquo; cried Levin,
        getting up, and unable to restrain his anger any longer. But at the same
        second he felt that he was beating himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then why did you marry? You could have been free. Why did you, if
        you regret it?&rdquo; she said, getting up and running away into the
        drawing-room.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he went to her, she was sobbing.
      </p>

      <p>
        He began to speak, trying to find words not to dissuade but simply to
        soothe her. But she did not heed him, and would not agree to anything.
        He bent down to her and took her hand, which resisted him. He kissed her
        hand, kissed her hair, kissed her hand again&mdash;still she was silent.
        But when he took her face in both his hands and said
        &ldquo;Kitty!&rdquo; she suddenly recovered herself, and began to cry,
        and they were reconciled.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was decided that they should go together the next day. Levin told his
        wife that he believed she wanted to go simply in order to be of use,
        agreed that Marya Nikolaevna&rsquo;s being with his brother did not make
        her going improper, but he set off at the bottom of his heart
        dissatisfied both with her and with himself. He was dissatisfied with
        her for being unable to make up her mind to let him go when it was
        necessary (and how strange it was for him to think that he, so lately
        hardly daring to believe in such happiness as that she could love
        him&mdash;now was unhappy because she loved him too much!), and he was
        dissatisfied with himself for not showing more strength of will. Even
        greater was the feeling of disagreement at the bottom of his heart as to
        her not needing to consider the woman who was with his brother, and he
        thought with horror of all the contingencies they might meet with. The
        mere idea of his wife, his Kitty, being in the same room with a common
        wench, set him shuddering with horror and loathing.

      <h3>Chapter 17</h3>

      <p>
        The hotel of the provincial town where Nikolay Levin was lying ill was
        one of those provincial hotels which are constructed on the newest model
        of modern improvements, with the best intentions of cleanliness,
        comfort, and even elegance, but owing to the public that patronizes
        them, are with astounding rapidity transformed into filthy taverns with
        a pretension of modern improvement that only makes them worse than the
        old-fashioned, honestly filthy hotels. This hotel had already reached
        that stage, and the soldier in a filthy uniform smoking in the entry,
        supposed to stand for a hall-porter, and the cast-iron, slippery, dark,
        and disagreeable staircase, and the free and easy waiter in a filthy
        frock coat, and the common dining-room with a dusty bouquet of wax
        flowers adorning the table, and filth, dust, and disorder everywhere,
        and at the same time the sort of modern up-to-date self-complacent
        railway uneasiness of this hotel, aroused a most painful feeling in
        Levin after their fresh young life, especially because the impression of
        falsity made by the hotel was so out of keeping with what awaited them.
      </p>

      <p>
        As is invariably the case, after they had been asked at what price they
        wanted rooms, it appeared that there was not one decent room for them;
        one decent room had been taken by the inspector of railroads, another by
        a lawyer from Moscow, a third by Princess Astafieva from the country.
        There remained only one filthy room, next to which they promised that
        another should be empty by the evening. Feeling angry with his wife
        because what he had expected had come to pass, which was that at the
        moment of arrival, when his heart throbbed with emotion and anxiety to
        know how his brother was getting on, he should have to be seeing after
        her, instead of rushing straight to his brother, Levin conducted her to
        the room assigned them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Go, do go!&rdquo; she said, looking at him with timid and guilty
        eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        He went out of the door without a word, and at once stumbled over Marya
        Nikolaevna, who had heard of his arrival and had not dared to go in to
        see him. She was just the same as when he saw her in Moscow; the same
        woolen gown, and bare arms and neck, and the same good-naturedly stupid,
        pockmarked face, only a little plumper.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, how is he? how is he?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very bad. He can&rsquo;t get up. He has kept expecting you.
        He.... Are you ... with your wife?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin did not for the first moment understand what it was confused her,
        but she immediately enlightened him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go away. I&rsquo;ll go down to the kitchen,&rdquo; she
        brought out. &ldquo;Nikolay Dmitrievitch will be delighted. He heard
        about it, and knows your lady, and remembers her abroad.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin realized that she meant his wife, and did not know what answer to
        make.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come along, come along to him!&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        But as soon as he moved, the door of his room opened and Kitty peeped
        out. Levin crimsoned both from shame and anger with his wife, who had
        put herself and him in such a difficult position; but Marya Nikolaevna
        crimsoned still more. She positively shrank together and flushed to the
        point of tears, and clutching the ends of her apron in both hands,
        twisted them in her red fingers without knowing what to say and what to
        do.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the first instant Levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the
        eyes with which Kitty looked at this awful woman, so incomprehensible to
        her; but it lasted only a single instant.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well! how is he?&rdquo; she turned to her husband and then to
        her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But one can&rsquo;t go on talking in the passage like
        this!&rdquo; Levin said, looking angrily at a gentleman who walked
        jauntily at that instant across the corridor, as though about his
        affairs.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well then, come in,&rdquo; said Kitty, turning to Marya
        Nikolaevna, who had recovered herself, but noticing her husband&rsquo;s
        face of dismay, &ldquo;or go on; go, and then come for me,&rdquo; she
        said, and went back into the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin went to his brother&rsquo;s room. He had not in the least expected
        what he saw and felt in his brother&rsquo;s room. He had expected to
        find him in the same state of self-deception which he had heard was so
        frequent with the consumptive, and which had struck him so much during
        his brother&rsquo;s visit in the autumn. He had expected to find the
        physical signs of the approach of death more marked&mdash;greater
        weakness, greater emaciation, but still almost the same condition of
        things. He had expected himself to feel the same distress at the loss of
        the brother he loved and the same horror in face of death as he had felt
        then, only in a greater degree. And he had prepared himself for this;
        but he found something utterly different.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a little dirty room with the painted panels of its walls filthy with
        spittle, and conversation audible through the thin partition from the
        next room, in a stifling atmosphere saturated with impurities, on a
        bedstead moved away from the wall, there lay covered with a quilt, a
        body. One arm of this body was above the quilt, and the wrist, huge as a
        rake-handle, was attached, inconceivably it seemed, to the thin, long
        bone of the arm smooth from the beginning to the middle. The head lay
        sideways on the pillow. Levin could see the scanty locks wet with sweat
        on the temples and tense, transparent-looking forehead.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It cannot be that that fearful body was my brother
        Nikolay?&rdquo; thought Levin. But he went closer, saw the face, and
        doubt became impossible. In spite of the terrible change in the face,
        Levin had only to glance at those eager eyes raised at his approach,
        only to catch the faint movement of the mouth under the sticky mustache,
        to realize the terrible truth that this death-like body was his living
        brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        The glittering eyes looked sternly and reproachfully at his brother as
        he drew near. And immediately this glance established a living
        relationship between living men. Levin immediately felt the reproach in
        the eyes fixed on him, and felt remorse at his own happiness.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Konstantin took him by the hand, Nikolay smiled. The smile was
        faint, scarcely perceptible, and in spite of the smile the stern
        expression of the eyes was unchanged.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You did not expect to find me like this,&rdquo; he articulated
        with effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes ... no,&rdquo; said Levin, hesitating over his words.
        &ldquo;How was it you didn&rsquo;t let me know before, that is, at the
        time of my wedding? I made inquiries in all directions.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He had to talk so as not to be silent, and he did not know what to say,
        especially as his brother made no reply, and simply stared without
        dropping his eyes, and evidently penetrated to the inner meaning of each
        word. Levin told his brother that his wife had come with him. Nikolay
        expressed pleasure, but said he was afraid of frightening her by his
        condition. A silence followed. Suddenly Nikolay stirred, and began to
        say something. Levin expected something of peculiar gravity and
        importance from the expression of his face, but Nikolay began speaking
        of his health. He found fault with the doctor, regretting he had not a
        celebrated Moscow doctor. Levin saw that he still hoped.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seizing the first moment of silence, Levin got up, anxious to escape, if
        only for an instant, from his agonizing emotion, and said that he would
        go and fetch his wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, and I&rsquo;ll tell her to tidy up here. It&rsquo;s
        dirty and stinking here, I expect. Marya! clear up the room,&rdquo; the
        sick man said with effort. &ldquo;Oh, and when you&rsquo;ve cleared up,
        go away yourself,&rdquo; he added, looking inquiringly at his brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin made no answer. Going out into the corridor, he stopped short. He
        had said he would fetch his wife, but now, taking stock of the emotion
        he was feeling, he decided that he would try on the contrary to persuade
        her not to go in to the sick man. &ldquo;Why should she suffer as I am
        suffering?&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, how is he?&rdquo; Kitty asked with a frightened face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s awful, it&rsquo;s awful! What did you come
        for?&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty was silent for a few seconds, looking timidly and ruefully at her
        husband; then she went up and took him by the elbow with both hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kostya! take me to him; it will be easier for us to bear it
        together. You only take me, take me to him, please, and go away,&rdquo;
        she said. &ldquo;You must understand that for me to see you, and not to
        see him, is far more painful. There I might be a help to you and to him.
        Please, let me!&rdquo; she besought her husband, as though the happiness
        of her life depended on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin was obliged to agree, and regaining his composure, and completely
        forgetting about Marya Nikolaevna by now, he went again in to his
        brother with Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepping lightly, and continually glancing at her husband, showing him a
        valorous and sympathetic face, Kitty went into the sick-room, and,
        turning without haste, noiselessly closed the door. With inaudible steps
        she went quickly to the sick man&rsquo;s bedside, and going up so that
        he had not to turn his head, she immediately clasped in her fresh young
        hand the skeleton of his huge hand, pressed it, and began speaking with
        that soft eagerness, sympathetic and not jarring, which is peculiar to
        women.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We have met, though we were not acquainted, at Soden,&rdquo; she
        said. &ldquo;You never thought I was to be your sister?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You would not have recognized me?&rdquo; he said, with a radiant
        smile at her entrance.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I should. What a good thing you let us know! Not a day has
        passed that Kostya has not mentioned you, and been anxious.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But the sick man&rsquo;s interest did not last long.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before she had finished speaking, there had come back into his face the
        stern, reproachful expression of the dying man&rsquo;s envy of the
        living.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am afraid you are not quite comfortable here,&rdquo; she said,
        turning away from his fixed stare, and looking about the room. &ldquo;We
        must ask about another room,&rdquo; she said to her husband, &ldquo;so
        that we might be nearer.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 18</h3>

      <p>
        Levin could not look calmly at his brother; he could not himself be
        natural and calm in his presence. When he went in to the sick man, his
        eyes and his attention were unconsciously dimmed, and he did not see and
        did not distinguish the details of his brother&rsquo;s position. He
        smelt the awful odor, saw the dirt, disorder, and miserable condition,
        and heard the groans, and felt that nothing could be done to help. It
        never entered his head to analyze the details of the sick man&rsquo;s
        situation, to consider how that body was lying under the quilt, how
        those emaciated legs and thighs and spine were lying huddled up, and
        whether they could not be made more comfortable, whether anything could
        not be done to make things, if not better, at least less bad. It made
        his blood run cold when he began to think of all these details. He was
        absolutely convinced that nothing could be done to prolong his
        brother&rsquo;s life or to relieve his suffering. But a sense of his
        regarding all aid as out of the question was felt by the sick man, and
        exasperated him. And this made it still more painful for Levin. To be in
        the sick-room was agony to him, not to be there still worse. And he was
        continually, on various pretexts, going out of the room, and coming in
        again, because he was unable to remain alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Kitty thought, and felt, and acted quite differently. On seeing the
        sick man, she pitied him. And pity in her womanly heart did not arouse
        at all that feeling of horror and loathing that it aroused in her
        husband, but a desire to act, to find out all the details of his state,
        and to remedy them. And since she had not the slightest doubt that it
        was her duty to help him, she had no doubt either that it was possible,
        and immediately set to work. The very details, the mere thought of which
        reduced her husband to terror, immediately engaged her attention. She
        sent for the doctor, sent to the chemist&rsquo;s, set the maid who had
        come with her and Marya Nikolaevna to sweep and dust and scrub; she
        herself washed up something, washed out something else, laid something
        under the quilt. Something was by her directions brought into the
        sick-room, something else was carried out. She herself went several
        times to her room, regardless of the men she met in the corridor, got
        out and brought in sheets, pillow cases, towels, and shirts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The waiter, who was busy with a party of engineers dining in the dining
        hall, came several times with an irate countenance in answer to her
        summons, and could not avoid carrying out her orders, as she gave them
        with such gracious insistence that there was no evading her. Levin did
        not approve of all this; he did not believe it would be of any good to
        the patient. Above all, he feared the patient would be angry at it. But
        the sick man, though he seemed and was indifferent about it, was not
        angry, but only abashed, and on the whole as it were interested in what
        she was doing with him. Coming back from the doctor to whom Kitty had
        sent him, Levin, on opening the door, came upon the sick man at the
        instant when, by Kitty&rsquo;s directions, they were changing his linen.
        The long white ridge of his spine, with the huge, prominent shoulder
        blades and jutting ribs and vertebrae, was bare, and Marya Nikolaevna
        and the waiter were struggling with the sleeve of the night shirt, and
        could not get the long, limp arm into it. Kitty, hurriedly closing the
        door after Levin, was not looking that way; but the sick man groaned,
        and she moved rapidly towards him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Make haste,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you come,&rdquo; said the sick man angrily.
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it my myself....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What say?&rdquo; queried Marya Nikolaevna. But Kitty heard and
        saw he was ashamed and uncomfortable at being naked before her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not looking, I&rsquo;m not looking!&rdquo; she said,
        putting the arm in. &ldquo;Marya Nikolaevna, you come this side, you do
        it,&rdquo; she added.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Please go for me, there&rsquo;s a little bottle in my small
        bag,&rdquo; she said, turning to her husband, &ldquo;you know, in the
        side pocket; bring it, please, and meanwhile they&rsquo;ll finish
        clearing up here.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Returning with the bottle, Levin found the sick man settled comfortably
        and everything about him completely changed. The heavy smell was
        replaced by the smell of aromatic vinegar, which Kitty with pouting lips
        and puffed-out, rosy cheeks was squirting through a little pipe. There
        was no dust visible anywhere, a rug was laid by the bedside. On the
        table stood medicine bottles and decanters tidily arranged, and the
        linen needed was folded up there, and Kitty&rsquo;s
        <i>broderie anglaise</i>. On the other table by the patient&rsquo;s bed
        there were candles and drink and powders. The sick man himself, washed
        and combed, lay in clean sheets on high raised pillows, in a clean
        night-shirt with a white collar about his astoundingly thin neck, and
        with a new expression of hope looked fixedly at Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        The doctor brought by Levin, and found by him at the club, was not the
        one who had been attending Nikolay Levin, as the patient was
        dissatisfied with him. The new doctor took up a stethoscope and sounded
        the patient, shook his head, prescribed medicine, and with extreme
        minuteness explained first how to take the medicine and then what diet
        was to be kept to. He advised eggs, raw or hardly cooked, and seltzer
        water, with warm milk at a certain temperature. When the doctor had gone
        away the sick man said something to his brother, of which Levin could
        distinguish only the last words: &ldquo;Your Katya.&rdquo; By the
        expression with which he gazed at her, Levin saw that he was praising
        her. He called indeed to Katya, as he called her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much better already,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why, with
        you I should have got well long ago. How nice it is!&rdquo; he took her
        hand and drew it towards his lips, but as though afraid she would
        dislike it he changed his mind, let it go, and only stroked it. Kitty
        took his hand in both hers and pressed it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Now turn me over on the left side and go to bed,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        No one could make out what he said but Kitty; she alone understood. She
        understood because she was all the while mentally keeping watch on what
        he needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;On the other side,&rdquo; she said to her husband, &ldquo;he
        always sleeps on that side. Turn him over, it&rsquo;s so disagreeable
        calling the servants. I&rsquo;m not strong enough. Can you?&rdquo; she
        said to Marya Nikolaevna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; answered Marya Nikolaevna.
      </p>

      <p>
        Terrible as it was to Levin to put his arms round that terrible body, to
        take hold of that under the quilt, of which he preferred to know
        nothing, under his wife&rsquo;s influence he made his resolute face that
        she knew so well, and putting his arms into the bed took hold of the
        body, but in spite of his own strength he was struck by the strange
        heaviness of those powerless limbs. While he was turning him over,
        conscious of the huge emaciated arm about his neck, Kitty swiftly and
        noiselessly turned the pillow, beat it up and settled in it the sick
        man&rsquo;s head, smoothing back his hair, which was sticking again to
        his moist brow.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sick man kept his brother&rsquo;s hand in his own. Levin felt that
        he meant to do something with his hand and was pulling it somewhere.
        Levin yielded with a sinking heart: yes, he drew it to his mouth and
        kissed it. Levin, shaking with sobs and unable to articulate a word,
        went out of the room.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 19</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast
        revealed them unto babes.&rdquo; So Levin thought about his wife as he
        talked to her that evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin thought of the text, not because he considered himself &ldquo;wise
        and prudent.&rdquo; He did not so consider himself, but he could not
        help knowing that he had more intellect than his wife and Agafea
        Mihalovna, and he could not help knowing that when he thought of death,
        he thought with all the force of his intellect. He knew too that the
        brains of many great men, whose thoughts he had read, had brooded over
        death and yet knew not a hundredth part of what his wife and Agafea
        Mihalovna knew about it. Different as those two women were, Agafea
        Mihalovna and Katya, as his brother Nikolay had called her, and as Levin
        particularly liked to call her now, they were quite alike in this. Both
        knew, without a shade of doubt, what sort of thing life was and what was
        death, and though neither of them could have answered, and would even
        not have understood the questions that presented themselves to Levin,
        both had no doubt of the significance of this event, and were precisely
        alike in their way of looking at it, which they shared with millions of
        people. The proof that they knew for a certainty the nature of death lay
        in the fact that they knew without a second of hesitation how to deal
        with the dying, and were not frightened of them. Levin and other men
        like him, though they could have said a great deal about death,
        obviously did not know this since they were afraid of death, and were
        absolutely at a loss what to do when people were dying. If Levin had
        been alone now with his brother Nikolay, he would have looked at him
        with terror, and with still greater terror waited, and would not have
        known what else to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        More than that, he did not know what to say, how to look, how to move.
        To talk of outside things seemed to him shocking, impossible, to talk of
        death and depressing subjects&mdash;also impossible. To be silent, also
        impossible. &ldquo;If I look at him he will think I am studying him, I
        am afraid; if I don&rsquo;t look at him, he&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m
        thinking of other things. If I walk on tiptoe, he will be vexed; to
        tread firmly, I&rsquo;m ashamed.&rdquo; Kitty evidently did not think of
        herself, and had no time to think about herself: she was thinking about
        him because she knew something, and all went well. She told him about
        herself even and about her wedding, and smiled and sympathized with him
        and petted him, and talked of cases of recovery and all went well; so
        then she must know. The proof that her behavior and Agafea
        Mihalovna&rsquo;s was not instinctive, animal, irrational, was that
        apart from the physical treatment, the relief of suffering, both Agafea
        Mihalovna and Kitty required for the dying man something else more
        important than the physical treatment, and something which had nothing
        in common with physical conditions. Agafea Mihalovna, speaking of the
        man just dead, had said: &ldquo;Well, thank God, he took the sacrament
        and received absolution; God grant each one of us such a death.&rdquo;
        Katya in just the same way, besides all her care about linen, bedsores,
        drink, found time the very first day to persuade the sick man of the
        necessity of taking the sacrament and receiving absolution.
      </p>

      <p>
        On getting back from the sick-room to their own two rooms for the night,
        Levin sat with hanging head not knowing what to do. Not to speak of
        supper, of preparing for bed, of considering what they were going to do,
        he could not even talk to his wife; he was ashamed to. Kitty, on the
        contrary, was more active than usual. She was even livelier than usual.
        She ordered supper to be brought, herself unpacked their things, and
        herself helped to make the beds, and did not even forget to sprinkle
        them with Persian powder. She showed that alertness, that swiftness of
        reflection which comes out in men before a battle, in conflict, in the
        dangerous and decisive moments of life&mdash;those moments when a man
        shows once and for all his value, and that all his past has not been
        wasted but has been a preparation for these moments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything went rapidly in her hands, and before it was twelve
        o&rsquo;clock all their things were arranged cleanly and tidily in her
        rooms, in such a way that the hotel rooms seemed like home: the beds
        were made, brushes, combs, looking-glasses were put out, table napkins
        were spread.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin felt that it was unpardonable to eat, to sleep, to talk even now,
        and it seemed to him that every movement he made was unseemly. She
        arranged the brushes, but she did it all so that there was nothing
        shocking in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        They could neither of them eat, however, and for a long while they could
        not sleep, and did not even go to bed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very glad I persuaded him to receive extreme unction
        tomorrow,&rdquo; she said, sitting in her dressing jacket before her
        folding looking-glass, combing her soft, fragrant hair with a fine comb.
        &ldquo;I have never seen it, but I know, mamma has told me, there are
        prayers said for recovery.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you suppose he can possibly recover?&rdquo; said Levin,
        watching a slender tress at the back of her round little head that was
        continually hidden when she passed the comb through the front.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I asked the doctor; he said he couldn&rsquo;t live more than
        three days. But can they be sure? I&rsquo;m very glad, anyway, that I
        persuaded him,&rdquo; she said, looking askance at her husband through
        her hair. &ldquo;Anything is possible,&rdquo; she added with that
        peculiar, rather sly expression that was always in her face when she
        spoke of religion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since their conversation about religion when they were engaged neither
        of them had ever started a discussion of the subject, but she performed
        all the ceremonies of going to church, saying her prayers, and so on,
        always with the unvarying conviction that this ought to be so. In spite
        of his assertion to the contrary, she was firmly persuaded that he was
        as much a Christian as she, and indeed a far better one; and all that he
        said about it was simply one of his absurd masculine freaks, just as he
        would say about her <i>broderie anglaise</i> that good people patch
        holes, but that she cut them on purpose, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you see this woman, Marya Nikolaevna, did not know how to
        manage all this,&rdquo; said Levin. &ldquo;And ... I must own I&rsquo;m
        very, very glad you came. You are such purity that....&rdquo; He took
        her hand and did not kiss it (to kiss her hand in such closeness to
        death seemed to him improper); he merely squeezed it with a penitent
        air, looking at her brightening eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It would have been miserable for you to be alone,&rdquo; she
        said, and lifting her hands which hid her cheeks flushing with pleasure,
        twisted her coil of hair on the nape of her neck and pinned it there.
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;she did not know how.... Luckily,
        I learned a lot at Soden.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Surely there are not people there so ill?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Worse.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s so awful to me is that I can&rsquo;t see him as he
        was when he was young. You would not believe how charming he was as a
        youth, but I did not understand him then.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can quite, quite believe it. How I feel that we might have been
        friends!&rdquo; she said; and, distressed at what she had said, she
        looked round at her husband, and tears came into her eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, <i>might have been</i>,&rdquo; he said mournfully.
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just one of those people of whom they say
        they&rsquo;re not for this world.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But we have many days before us; we must go to bed,&rdquo; said
        Kitty, glancing at her tiny watch.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 20</h3>

      <p>
        The next day the sick man received the sacrament and extreme unction.
        During the ceremony Nikolay Levin prayed fervently. His great eyes,
        fastened on the holy image that was set out on a card-table covered with
        a colored napkin, expressed such passionate prayer and hope that it was
        awful to Levin to see it. Levin knew that this passionate prayer and
        hope would only make him feel more bitterly parting from the life he so
        loved. Levin knew his brother and the workings of his intellect: he knew
        that his unbelief came not from life being easier for him without faith,
        but had grown up because step by step the contemporary scientific
        interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the possibility of
        faith; and so he knew that his present return was not a legitimate one,
        brought about by way of the same working of his intellect, but simply a
        temporary, interested return to faith in a desperate hope of recovery.
        Levin knew too that Kitty had strengthened his hope by accounts of the
        marvelous recoveries she had heard of. Levin knew all this; and it was
        agonizingly painful to him to behold the supplicating, hopeful eyes and
        the emaciated wrist, lifted with difficulty, making the sign of the
        cross on the tense brow, and the prominent shoulders and hollow, gasping
        chest, which one could not feel consistent with the life the sick man
        was praying for. During the sacrament Levin did what he, an unbeliever,
        had done a thousand times. He said, addressing God, &ldquo;If Thou dost
        exist, make this man to recover&rdquo; (of course this same thing has
        been repeated many times), &ldquo;and Thou wilt save him and me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        After extreme unction the sick man became suddenly much better. He did
        not cough once in the course of an hour, smiled, kissed Kitty&rsquo;s
        hand, thanking her with tears, and said he was comfortable, free from
        pain, and that he felt strong and had an appetite. He even raised
        himself when his soup was brought, and asked for a cutlet as well.
        Hopelessly ill as he was, obvious as it was at the first glance that he
        could not recover, Levin and Kitty were for that hour both in the same
        state of excitement, happy, though fearful of being mistaken.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is he better?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, much.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wonderful in it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anyway, he&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; they said in a whisper, smiling
        to one another.
      </p>

      <p>
        This self-deception was not of long duration. The sick man fell into a
        quiet sleep, but he was waked up half an hour later by his cough. And
        all at once every hope vanished in those about him and in himself. The
        reality of his suffering crushed all hopes in Levin and Kitty and in the
        sick man himself, leaving no doubt, no memory even of past hopes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without referring to what he had believed in half an hour before, as
        though ashamed even to recall it, he asked for iodine to inhale in a
        bottle covered with perforated paper. Levin gave him the bottle, and the
        same look of passionate hope with which he had taken the sacrament was
        now fastened on his brother, demanding from him the confirmation of the
        doctor&rsquo;s words that inhaling iodine worked wonders.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is Katya not here?&rdquo; he gasped, looking round while Levin
        reluctantly assented to the doctor&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;No; so I can
        say it.... It was for her sake I went through that farce. She&rsquo;s so
        sweet; but you and I can&rsquo;t deceive ourselves. This is what I
        believe in,&rdquo; he said, and, squeezing the bottle in his bony hand,
        he began breathing over it.
      </p>

      <p>
        At eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening Levin and his wife were drinking
        tea in their room when Marya Nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly. She
        was pale, and her lips were quivering. &ldquo;He is dying!&rdquo; she
        whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid will die this minute.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Both of them ran to him. He was sitting raised up with one elbow on the
        bed, his long back bent, and his head hanging low.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; Levin asked in a whisper, after a
        silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I feel I&rsquo;m setting off,&rdquo; Nikolay said with
        difficulty, but with extreme distinctness, screwing the words out of
        himself. He did not raise his head, but simply turned his eyes upwards,
        without their reaching his brother&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Katya, go
        away!&rdquo; he added.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin jumped up, and with a peremptory whisper made her go out.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m setting off,&rdquo; he said again.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo; said Levin, so as to say something.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m setting off,&rdquo; he repeated, as though he
        had a liking for the phrase. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Marya Nikolaevna went up to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You had better lie down; you&rsquo;d be easier,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall lie down soon enough,&rdquo; he pronounced slowly,
        &ldquo;when I&rsquo;m dead,&rdquo; he said sarcastically, wrathfully.
        &ldquo;Well, you can lay me down if you like.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin laid his brother on his back, sat down beside him, and gazed at
        his face, holding his breath. The dying man lay with closed eyes, but
        the muscles twitched from time to time on his forehead, as with one
        thinking deeply and intensely. Levin involuntarily thought with him of
        what it was that was happening to him now, but in spite of all his
        mental efforts to go along with him he saw by the expression of that
        calm, stern face that for the dying man all was growing clearer and
        clearer that was still as dark as ever for Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, so,&rdquo; the dying man articulated slowly at
        intervals. &ldquo;Wait a little.&rdquo; He was silent.
        &ldquo;Right!&rdquo; he pronounced all at once reassuringly, as though
        all were solved for him. &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; he murmured, and sighed
        deeply.
      </p>

      <p>
        Marya Nikolaevna felt his feet. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting
        cold,&rdquo; she whispered.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a long while, a very long while it seemed to Levin, the sick man lay
        motionless. But he was still alive, and from time to time he sighed.
        Levin by now was exhausted from mental strain. He felt that, with no
        mental effort, could he understand what it was that was <i>right</i>. He
        could not even think of the problem of death itself, but with no will of
        his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he had to do next; closing
        the dead man&rsquo;s eyes, dressing him, ordering the coffin. And,
        strange to say, he felt utterly cold, and was not conscious of sorrow
        nor of loss, less still of pity for his brother. If he had any feeling
        for his brother at that moment, it was envy for the knowledge the dying
        man had now that he could not have.
      </p>

      <p>
        A long time more he sat over him so, continually expecting the end. But
        the end did not come. The door opened and Kitty appeared. Levin got up
        to stop her. But at the moment he was getting up, he caught the sound of
        the dying man stirring.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away,&rdquo; said Nikolay and held out his hand.
        Levin gave him his, and angrily waved to his wife to go away.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the dying man&rsquo;s hand in his hand, he sat for half an hour, an
        hour, another hour. He did not think of death at all now. He wondered
        what Kitty was doing; who lived in the next room; whether the doctor
        lived in a house of his own. He longed for food and for sleep. He
        cautiously drew away his hand and felt the feet. The feet were cold, but
        the sick man was still breathing. Levin tried again to move away on
        tiptoe, but the sick man stirred again and said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
        go.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The dawn came; the sick man&rsquo;s condition was unchanged. Levin
        stealthily withdrew his hand, and without looking at the dying man, went
        off to his own room and went to sleep. When he woke up, instead of news
        of his brother&rsquo;s death which he expected, he learned that the sick
        man had returned to his earlier condition. He had begun sitting up
        again, coughing, had begun eating again, talking again, and again had
        ceased to talk of death, again had begun to express hope of his
        recovery, and had become more irritable and more gloomy than ever. No
        one, neither his brother nor Kitty, could soothe him. He was angry with
        everyone, and said nasty things to everyone, reproached everyone for his
        sufferings, and insisted that they should get him a celebrated doctor
        from Moscow. To all inquiries made him as to how he felt, he made the
        same answer with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness,
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m suffering horribly, intolerably!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The sick man was suffering more and more, especially from bedsores,
        which it was impossible now to remedy, and grew more and more angry with
        everyone about him, blaming them for everything, and especially for not
        having brought him a doctor from Moscow. Kitty tried in every possible
        way to relieve him, to soothe him; but it was all in vain, and Levin saw
        that she herself was exhausted both physically and morally, though she
        would not admit it. The sense of death, which had been evoked in all by
        his taking leave of life on the night when he had sent for his brother,
        was broken up. Everyone knew that he must inevitably die soon, that he
        was half dead already. Everyone wished for nothing but that he should
        die as soon as possible, and everyone, concealing this, gave him
        medicines, tried to find remedies and doctors, and deceived him and
        themselves and each other. All this was falsehood, disgusting,
        irreverent deceit. And owing to the bent of his character, and because
        he loved the dying man more than anyone else did, Levin was most
        painfully conscious of this deceit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin, who had long been possessed by the idea of reconciling his
        brothers, at least in face of death, had written to his brother, Sergey
        Ivanovitch, and having received an answer from him, he read this letter
        to the sick man. Sergey Ivanovitch wrote that he could not come himself,
        and in touching terms he begged his brother&rsquo;s forgiveness.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sick man said nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What am I to write to him?&rdquo; said Levin. &ldquo;I hope you
        are not angry with him?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, not the least!&rdquo; Nikolay answered, vexed at the
        question. &ldquo;Tell him to send me a doctor.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Three more days of agony followed; the sick man was still in the same
        condition. The sense of longing for his death was felt by everyone now
        at the mere sight of him, by the waiters and the hotel-keeper and all
        the people staying in the hotel, and the doctor and Marya Nikolaevna and
        Levin and Kitty. The sick man alone did not express this feeling, but on
        the contrary was furious at their not getting him doctors, and went on
        taking medicine and talking of life. Only at rare moments, when the
        opium gave him an instant&rsquo;s relief from the never-ceasing pain, he
        would sometimes, half asleep, utter what was ever more intense in his
        heart than in all the others: &ldquo;Oh, if it were only the end!&rdquo;
        or: &ldquo;When will it be over?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        His sufferings, steadily growing more intense, did their work and
        prepared him for death. There was no position in which he was not in
        pain, there was not a minute in which he was unconscious of it, not a
        limb, not a part of his body that did not ache and cause him agony. Even
        the memories, the impressions, the thoughts of this body awakened in him
        now the same aversion as the body itself. The sight of other people,
        their remarks, his own reminiscences, everything was for him a source of
        agony. Those about him felt this, and instinctively did not allow
        themselves to move freely, to talk, to express their wishes before him.
        All his life was merged in the one feeling of suffering and desire to be
        rid of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was evidently coming over him that revulsion that would make him
        look upon death as the goal of his desires, as happiness. Hitherto each
        individual desire, aroused by suffering or privation, such as hunger,
        fatigue, thirst, had been satisfied by some bodily function giving
        pleasure. But now no physical craving or suffering received relief, and
        the effort to relieve them only caused fresh suffering. And so all
        desires were merged in one&mdash;the desire to be rid of all his
        sufferings and their source, the body. But he had no words to express
        this desire of deliverance, and so he did not speak of it, and from
        habit asked for the satisfaction of desires which could not now be
        satisfied. &ldquo;Turn me over on the other side,&rdquo; he would say,
        and immediately after he would ask to be turned back again as before.
        &ldquo;Give me some broth. Take away the broth. Talk of something: why
        are you silent?&rdquo; And directly they began to talk he would close
        his eyes, and would show weariness, indifference, and loathing.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the tenth day from their arrival at the town, Kitty was unwell. She
        suffered from headache and sickness, and she could not get up all the
        morning.
      </p>

      <p>
        The doctor opined that the indisposition arose from fatigue and
        excitement, and prescribed rest.
      </p>

      <p>
        After dinner, however, Kitty got up and went as usual with her work to
        the sick man. He looked at her sternly when she came in, and smiled
        contemptuously when she said she had been unwell. That day he was
        continually blowing his nose, and groaning piteously.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; she asked him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Worse,&rdquo; he articulated with difficulty. &ldquo;In
        pain!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In pain, where?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Everywhere.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It will be over today, you will see,&rdquo; said Marya
        Nikolaevna. Though it was said in a whisper, the sick man, whose hearing
        Levin had noticed was very keen, must have heard. Levin said hush to
        her, and looked round at the sick man. Nikolay had heard; but these
        words produced no effect on him. His eyes had still the same intense,
        reproachful look.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo; Levin asked her, when she had
        followed him into the corridor.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He has begun picking at himself,&rdquo; said Marya Nikolaevna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Like this,&rdquo; she said, tugging at the folds of her woolen
        skirt. Levin noticed, indeed, that all that day the patient pulled at
        himself, as it were, trying to snatch something away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Marya Nikolaevna&rsquo;s prediction came true. Towards night the sick
        man was not able to lift his hands, and could only gaze before him with
        the same intensely concentrated expression in his eyes. Even when his
        brother or Kitty bent over him, so that he could see them, he looked
        just the same. Kitty sent for the priest to read the prayer for the
        dying.
      </p>

      <p>
        While the priest was reading it, the dying man did not show any sign of
        life; his eyes were closed. Levin, Kitty, and Marya Nikolaevna stood at
        the bedside. The priest had not quite finished reading the prayer when
        the dying man stretched, sighed, and opened his eyes. The priest, on
        finishing the prayer, put the cross to the cold forehead, then slowly
        returned it to the stand, and after standing for two minutes more in
        silence, he touched the huge, bloodless hand that was turning cold.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He is gone,&rdquo; said the priest, and would have moved away;
        but suddenly there was a faint stir in the mustaches of the dead man
        that seemed glued together, and quite distinctly in the hush they heard
        from the bottom of the chest the sharply defined sounds:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not quite ... soon.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And a minute later the face brightened, a smile came out under the
        mustaches, and the women who had gathered round began carefully laying
        out the corpse.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sight of his brother, and the nearness of death, revived in Levin
        that sense of horror in face of the insoluble enigma, together with the
        nearness and inevitability of death, that had come upon him that autumn
        evening when his brother had come to him. This feeling was now even
        stronger than before; even less than before did he feel capable of
        apprehending the meaning of death, and its inevitability rose up before
        him more terrible than ever. But now, thanks to his wife&rsquo;s
        presence, that feeling did not reduce him to despair. In spite of death,
        he felt the need of life and love. He felt that love saved him from
        despair, and that this love, under the menace of despair, had become
        still stronger and purer. The one mystery of death, still unsolved, had
        scarcely passed before his eyes, when another mystery had arisen, as
        insoluble, urging him to love and to life.
      </p>

      <p>
        The doctor confirmed his suppositions in regard to Kitty. Her
        indisposition was a symptom that she was with child.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 21</h3>

      <p>
        From the moment when Alexey Alexandrovitch understood from his
        interviews with Betsy and with Stepan Arkadyevitch that all that was
        expected of him was to leave his wife in peace, without burdening her
        with his presence, and that his wife herself desired this, he felt so
        distraught that he could come to no decision of himself; he did not know
        himself what he wanted now, and putting himself in the hands of those
        who were so pleased to interest themselves in his affairs, he met
        everything with unqualified assent. It was only when Anna had left his
        house, and the English governess sent to ask him whether she should dine
        with him or separately, that for the first time he clearly comprehended
        his position, and was appalled by it. Most difficult of all in this
        position was the fact that he could not in any way connect and reconcile
        his past with what was now. It was not the past when he had lived
        happily with his wife that troubled him. The transition from that past
        to a knowledge of his wife&rsquo;s unfaithfulness he had lived through
        miserably already; that state was painful, but he could understand it.
        If his wife had then, on declaring to him her unfaithfulness, left him,
        he would have been wounded, unhappy, but he would not have been in the
        hopeless position&mdash;incomprehensible to himself&mdash;in which he
        felt himself now. He could not now reconcile his immediate past, his
        tenderness, his love for his sick wife, and for the other man&rsquo;s
        child with what was now the case, that is with the fact that, as it
        were, in return for all this he now found himself alone, put to shame, a
        laughing-stock, needed by no one, and despised by everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the first two days after his wife&rsquo;s departure Alexey
        Alexandrovitch received applicants for assistance and his chief
        secretary, drove to the committee, and went down to dinner in the
        dining-room as usual. Without giving himself a reason for what he was
        doing, he strained every nerve of his being for those two days, simply
        to preserve an appearance of composure, and even of indifference.
        Answering inquiries about the disposition of Anna Arkadyevna&rsquo;s
        rooms and belongings, he had exercised immense self-control to appear
        like a man in whose eyes what had occurred was not unforeseen nor out of
        the ordinary course of events, and he attained his aim: no one could
        have detected in him signs of despair. But on the second day after her
        departure, when Korney gave him a bill from a fashionable draper&rsquo;s
        shop, which Anna had forgotten to pay, and announced that the clerk from
        the shop was waiting, Alexey Alexandrovitch told him to show the clerk
        up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, your excellency, for venturing to trouble you. But if
        you direct us to apply to her excellency, would you graciously oblige us
        with her address?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered, as it seemed to the clerk, and all at
        once, turning round, he sat down at the table. Letting his head sink
        into his hands, he sat for a long while in that position, several times
        attempted to speak and stopped short. Korney, perceiving his
        master&rsquo;s emotion, asked the clerk to call another time. Left
        alone, Alexey Alexandrovitch recognized that he had not the strength to
        keep up the line of firmness and composure any longer. He gave orders
        for the carriage that was awaiting him to be taken back, and for no one
        to be admitted, and he did not go down to dinner.
      </p>

      <p>
        He felt that he could not endure the weight of universal contempt and
        exasperation, which he had distinctly seen in the face of the clerk and
        of Korney, and of everyone, without exception, whom he had met during
        those two days. He felt that he could not turn aside from himself the
        hatred of men, because that hatred did not come from his being bad (in
        that case he could have tried to be better), but from his being
        shamefully and repulsively unhappy. He knew that for this, for the very
        fact that his heart was torn with grief, they would be merciless to him.
        He felt that men would crush him as dogs strangle a torn dog yelping
        with pain. He knew that his sole means of security against people was to
        hide his wounds from them, and instinctively he tried to do this for two
        days, but now he felt incapable of keeping up the unequal struggle.
      </p>

      <p>
        His despair was even intensified by the consciousness that he was
        utterly alone in his sorrow. In all Petersburg there was not a human
        being to whom he could express what he was feeling, who would feel for
        him, not as a high official, not as a member of society, but simply as a
        suffering man; indeed he had not such a one in the whole world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch grew up an orphan. There were two brothers. They
        did not remember their father, and their mother died when Alexey
        Alexandrovitch was ten years old. The property was a small one. Their
        uncle, Karenin, a government official of high standing, at one time a
        favorite of the late Tsar, had brought them up.
      </p>

      <p>
        On completing his high school and university courses with medals, Alexey
        Alexandrovitch had, with his uncle&rsquo;s aid, immediately started in a
        prominent position in the service, and from that time forward he had
        devoted himself exclusively to political ambition. In the high school
        and the university, and afterwards in the service, Alexey Alexandrovitch
        had never formed a close friendship with anyone. His brother had been
        the person nearest to his heart, but he had a post in the Ministry of
        Foreign Affairs, and was always abroad, where he had died shortly after
        Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s marriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        While he was governor of a province, Anna&rsquo;s aunt, a wealthy
        provincial lady, had thrown him&mdash;middle-aged as he was, though
        young for a governor&mdash;with her niece, and had succeeded in putting
        him in such a position that he had either to declare himself or to leave
        the town. Alexey Alexandrovitch was not long in hesitation. There were
        at the time as many reasons for the step as against it, and there was no
        overbalancing consideration to outweigh his invariable rule of
        abstaining when in doubt. But Anna&rsquo;s aunt had through a common
        acquaintance insinuated that he had already compromised the girl, and
        that he was in honor bound to make her an offer. He made the offer, and
        concentrated on his betrothed and his wife all the feeling of which he
        was capable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The attachment he felt to Anna precluded in his heart every need of
        intimate relations with others. And now among all his acquaintances he
        had not one friend. He had plenty of so-called connections, but no
        friendships. Alexey Alexandrovitch had plenty of people whom he could
        invite to dinner, to whose sympathy he could appeal in any public affair
        he was concerned about, whose interest he could reckon upon for anyone
        he wished to help, with whom he could candidly discuss other
        people&rsquo;s business and affairs of state. But his relations with
        these people were confined to one clearly defined channel, and had a
        certain routine from which it was impossible to depart. There was one
        man, a comrade of his at the university, with whom he had made friends
        later, and with whom he could have spoken of a personal sorrow; but this
        friend had a post in the Department of Education in a remote part of
        Russia. Of the people in Petersburg the most intimate and most possible
        were his chief secretary and his doctor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mihail Vassilievitch Sludin, the chief secretary, was a straightforward,
        intelligent, good-hearted, and conscientious man, and Alexey
        Alexandrovitch was aware of his personal goodwill. But their five years
        of official work together seemed to have put a barrier between them that
        cut off warmer relations.
      </p>

      <p>
        After signing the papers brought him, Alexey Alexandrovitch had sat for
        a long while in silence, glancing at Mihail Vassilievitch, and several
        times he attempted to speak, but could not. He had already prepared the
        phrase: &ldquo;You have heard of my trouble?&rdquo; But he ended by
        saying, as usual: &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll get this ready for me?&rdquo;
        and with that dismissed him.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other person was the doctor, who had also a kindly feeling for him;
        but there had long existed a taciturn understanding between them that
        both were weighed down by work, and always in a hurry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of his women friends, foremost amongst them Countess Lidia Ivanovna,
        Alexey Alexandrovitch never thought. All women, simply as women, were
        terrible and distasteful to him.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 22</h3>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch had forgotten the Countess Lidia Ivanovna, but she
        had not forgotten him. At the bitterest moment of his lonely despair she
        came to him, and without waiting to be announced, walked straight into
        his study. She found him as he was sitting with his head in both hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>J&rsquo;ai forcé la consigne</i>,&rdquo; she said, walking in
        with rapid steps and breathing hard with excitement and rapid exercise.
        &ldquo;I have heard all! Alexey Alexandrovitch! Dear friend!&rdquo; she
        went on, warmly squeezing his hand in both of hers and gazing with her
        fine pensive eyes into his.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch, frowning, got up, and disengaging his hand, moved
        her a chair.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down, countess? I&rsquo;m seeing no one
        because I&rsquo;m unwell, countess,&rdquo; he said, and his lips
        twitched.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dear friend!&rdquo; repeated Countess Lidia Ivanovna, never
        taking her eyes off his, and suddenly her eyebrows rose at the inner
        corners, describing a triangle on her forehead, her ugly yellow face
        became still uglier, but Alexey Alexandrovitch felt that she was sorry
        for him and was preparing to cry. And he too was softened; he snatched
        her plump hand and proceeded to kiss it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dear friend!&rdquo; she said in a voice breaking with emotion.
        &ldquo;You ought not to give way to grief. Your sorrow is a great one,
        but you ought to find consolation.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am crushed, I am annihilated, I am no longer a man!&rdquo; said
        Alexey Alexandrovitch, letting go her hand, but still gazing into her
        brimming eyes. &ldquo;My position is so awful because I can find
        nowhere, I cannot find within me strength to support me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You will find support; seek it&mdash;not in me, though I beseech
        you to believe in my friendship,&rdquo; she said, with a sigh.
        &ldquo;Our support is love, that love that He has vouchsafed us. His
        burden is light,&rdquo; she said, with the look of ecstasy Alexey
        Alexandrovitch knew so well. &ldquo;He will be your support and your
        succor.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Although there was in these words a flavor of that sentimental emotion
        at her own lofty feelings, and that new mystical fervor which had lately
        gained ground in Petersburg, and which seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch
        disproportionate, still it was pleasant to him to hear this now.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am weak. I am crushed. I foresaw nothing, and now I understand
        nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dear friend,&rdquo; repeated Lidia Ivanovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the loss of what I have not now, it&rsquo;s not
        that!&rdquo; pursued Alexey Alexandrovitch. &ldquo;I do not grieve for
        that. But I cannot help feeling humiliated before other people for the
        position I am placed in. It is wrong, but I can&rsquo;t help it, I
        can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not you it was performed that noble act of forgiveness, at which
        I was moved to ecstasy, and everyone else too, but He, working within
        your heart,&rdquo; said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, raising her eyes
        rapturously, &ldquo;and so you cannot be ashamed of your act.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch knitted his brows, and crooking his hands, he
        cracked his fingers.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;One must know all the facts,&rdquo; he said in his thin voice.
        &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s strength has its limits, countess, and I have
        reached my limits. The whole day I have had to be making arrangements,
        arrangements about household matters arising&rdquo; (he emphasized the
        word <i>arising</i>) &ldquo;from my new, solitary position. The
        servants, the governess, the accounts.... These pinpricks have stabbed
        me to the heart, and I have not the strength to bear it. At dinner ...
        yesterday, I was almost getting up from the dinner-table. I could not
        bear the way my son looked at me. He did not ask me the meaning of it
        all, but he wanted to ask, and I could not bear the look in his eyes. He
        was afraid to look at me, but that is not all....&rdquo; Alexey
        Alexandrovitch would have referred to the bill that had been brought
        him, but his voice shook, and he stopped. That bill on blue paper, for a
        hat and ribbons, he could not recall without a rush of self-pity.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I understand, dear friend,&rdquo; said Lidia Ivanovna. &ldquo;I
        understand it all. Succor and comfort you will find not in me, though I
        have come only to aid you if I can. If I could take from off you all
        these petty, humiliating cares ... I understand that a woman&rsquo;s
        word, a woman&rsquo;s superintendence is needed. You will intrust it to
        me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Silently and gratefully Alexey Alexandrovitch pressed her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Together we will take care of Seryozha. Practical affairs are not
        my strong point. But I will set to work. I will be your housekeeper.
        Don&rsquo;t thank me. I do it not from myself....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot help thanking you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But, dear friend, do not give way to the feeling of which you
        spoke&mdash;being ashamed of what is the Christian&rsquo;s highest
        glory: <i>he who humbles himself shall be exalted</i>. And you cannot
        thank me. You must thank Him, and pray to Him for succor. In Him alone
        we find peace, consolation, salvation, and love,&rdquo; she said, and
        turning her eyes heavenwards, she began praying, as Alexey
        Alexandrovitch gathered from her silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch listened to her now, and those expressions which
        had seemed to him, if not distasteful, at least exaggerated, now seemed
        to him natural and consolatory. Alexey Alexandrovitch had disliked this
        new enthusiastic fervor. He was a believer, who was interested in
        religion primarily in its political aspect, and the new doctrine which
        ventured upon several new interpretations, just because it paved the way
        to discussion and analysis, was in principle disagreeable to him. He had
        hitherto taken up a cold and even antagonistic attitude to this new
        doctrine, and with Countess Lidia Ivanovna, who had been carried away by
        it, he had never argued, but by silence had assiduously parried her
        attempts to provoke him into argument. Now for the first time he heard
        her words with pleasure, and did not inwardly oppose them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very, very grateful to you, both for your deeds and for your
        words,&rdquo; he said, when she had finished praying.
      </p>

      <p>
        Countess Lidia Ivanovna once more pressed both her friend&rsquo;s hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Now I will enter upon my duties,&rdquo; she said with a smile
        after a pause, as she wiped away the traces of tears. &ldquo;I am going
        to Seryozha. Only in the last extremity shall I apply to you.&rdquo; And
        she got up and went out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Countess Lidia Ivanovna went into Seryozha&rsquo;s part of the house,
        and dropping tears on the scared child&rsquo;s cheeks, she told him that
        his father was a saint and his mother was dead.

      <p>
        Countess Lidia Ivanovna kept her promise. She did actually take upon
        herself the care of the organization and management of Alexey
        Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s household. But she had not overstated the case
        when saying that practical affairs were not her strong point. All her
        arrangements had to be modified because they could not be carried out,
        and they were modified by Korney, Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s valet,
        who, though no one was aware of the fact, now managed Karenin&rsquo;s
        household, and quietly and discreetly reported to his master while he
        was dressing all it was necessary for him to know. But Lidia
        Ivanovna&rsquo;s help was none the less real; she gave Alexey
        Alexandrovitch moral support in the consciousness of her love and
        respect for him, and still more, as it was soothing to her to believe,
        in that she almost turned him to Christianity&mdash;that is, from an
        indifferent and apathetic believer she turned him into an ardent and
        steadfast adherent of the new interpretation of Christian doctrine,
        which had been gaining ground of late in Petersburg. It was easy for
        Alexey Alexandrovitch to believe in this teaching. Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, like Lidia Ivanovna indeed, and others who shared their
        views, was completely devoid of vividness of imagination, that spiritual
        faculty in virtue of which the conceptions evoked by the imagination
        become so vivid that they must needs be in harmony with other
        conceptions, and with actual fact. He saw nothing impossible and
        inconceivable in the idea that death, though existing for unbelievers,
        did not exist for him, and that, as he was possessed of the most perfect
        faith, of the measure of which he was himself the judge, therefore there
        was no sin in his soul, and he was experiencing complete salvation here
        on earth.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is true that the erroneousness and shallowness of this conception of
        his faith was dimly perceptible to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and he knew
        that when, without the slightest idea that his forgiveness was the
        action of a higher power, he had surrendered directly to the feeling of
        forgiveness, he had felt more happiness than now when he was thinking
        every instant that Christ was in his heart, and that in signing official
        papers he was doing His will. But for Alexey Alexandrovitch it was a
        necessity to think in that way; it was such a necessity for him in his
        humiliation to have some elevated standpoint, however imaginary, from
        which, looked down upon by all, he could look down on others, that he
        clung, as to his one salvation, to his delusion of salvation.

      <h3>Chapter 23</h3>

      <p>
        The Countess Lidia Ivanovna had, as a very young and sentimental girl,
        been married to a wealthy man of high rank, an extremely good-natured,
        jovial, and extremely dissipated rake. Two months after marriage her
        husband abandoned her, and her impassioned protestations of affection he
        met with a sarcasm and even hostility that people knowing the
        count&rsquo;s good heart, and seeing no defects in the sentimental
        Lidia, were at a loss to explain. Though they were divorced and lived
        apart, yet whenever the husband met the wife, he invariably behaved to
        her with the same malignant irony, the cause of which was
        incomprehensible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Countess Lidia Ivanovna had long given up being in love with her
        husband, but from that time she had never given up being in love with
        someone. She was in love with several people at once, both men and
        women; she had been in love with almost everyone who had been
        particularly distinguished in any way. She was in love with all the new
        princes and princesses who married into the imperial family; she had
        been in love with a high dignitary of the Church, a vicar, and a parish
        priest; she had been in love with a journalist, three Slavophiles, with
        Komissarov, with a minister, a doctor, an English missionary and
        Karenin. All these passions constantly waning or growing more ardent,
        did not prevent her from keeping up the most extended and complicated
        relations with the court and fashionable society. But from the time that
        after Karenin&rsquo;s trouble she took him under her special protection,
        from the time that she set to work in Karenin&rsquo;s household looking
        after his welfare, she felt that all her other attachments were not the
        real thing, and that she was now genuinely in love, and with no one but
        Karenin. The feeling she now experienced for him seemed to her stronger
        than any of her former feelings. Analyzing her feeling, and comparing it
        with former passions, she distinctly perceived that she would not have
        been in love with Komissarov if he had not saved the life of the Tsar,
        that she would not have been in love with Ristitch-Kudzhitsky if there
        had been no Slavonic question, but that she loved Karenin for himself,
        for his lofty, uncomprehended soul, for the sweet&mdash;to
        her&mdash;high notes of his voice, for his drawling intonation, his
        weary eyes, his character, and his soft white hands with their swollen
        veins. She was not simply overjoyed at meeting him, but she sought in
        his face signs of the impression she was making on him. She tried to
        please him, not by her words only, but in her whole person. For his sake
        it was that she now lavished more care on her dress than before. She
        caught herself in reveries on what might have been, if she had not been
        married and he had been free. She blushed with emotion when he came into
        the room, she could not repress a smile of rapture when he said anything
        amiable to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        For several days now Countess Lidia Ivanovna had been in a state of
        intense excitement. She had learned that Anna and Vronsky were in
        Petersburg. Alexey Alexandrovitch must be saved from seeing her, he must
        be saved even from the torturing knowledge that that awful woman was in
        the same town with him, and that he might meet her any minute.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lidia Ivanovna made inquiries through her friends as to what those
        <i>infamous people</i>, as she called Anna and Vronsky, intended doing,
        and she endeavored so to guide every movement of her friend during those
        days that he could not come across them. The young adjutant, an
        acquaintance of Vronsky, through whom she obtained her information, and
        who hoped through Countess Lidia Ivanovna to obtain a concession, told
        her that they had finished their business and were going away next day.
        Lidia Ivanovna had already begun to calm down, when the next morning a
        note was brought her, the handwriting of which she recognized with
        horror. It was the handwriting of Anna Karenina. The envelope was of
        paper as thick as bark; on the oblong yellow paper there was a huge
        monogram, and the letter smelt of agreeable scent.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who brought it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A commissionaire from the hotel.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        It was some time before Countess Lidia Ivanovna could sit down to read
        the letter. Her excitement brought on an attack of asthma, to which she
        was subject. When she had recovered her composure, she read the
        following letter in French:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <div>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Madame la Comtesse,
          </p>

          <p>
            &ldquo;The Christian feelings with which your heart is filled give
            me the, I feel, unpardonable boldness to write to you. I am
            miserable at being separated from my son. I entreat permission to
            see him once before my departure. Forgive me for recalling myself to
            your memory. I apply to you and not to Alexey Alexandrovitch, simply
            because I do not wish to cause that generous man to suffer in
            remembering me. Knowing your friendship for him, I know you will
            understand me. Could you send Seryozha to me, or should I come to
            the house at some fixed hour, or will you let me know when and where
            I could see him away from home? I do not anticipate a refusal,
            knowing the magnanimity of him with whom it rests. You cannot
            conceive the craving I have to see him, and so cannot conceive the
            gratitude your help will arouse in me.
          </p>

          <p class="right">
            &ldquo;Anna.&rdquo;
          </p>
        </div>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Everything in this letter exasperated Countess Lidia Ivanovna: its
        contents and the allusion to magnanimity, and especially its free and
        easy&mdash;as she considered&mdash;tone.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Say that there is no answer,&rdquo; said Countess Lidia Ivanovna,
        and immediately opening her blotting-book, she wrote to Alexey
        Alexandrovitch that she hoped to see him at one o&rsquo;clock at the
        levee.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I must talk with you of a grave and painful subject. There we
        will arrange where to meet. Best of all at my house, where I will order
        tea <i>as you like it</i>. Urgent. He lays the cross, but He gives the
        strength to bear it,&rdquo; she added, so as to give him some slight
        preparation. Countess Lidia Ivanovna usually wrote some two or three
        letters a day to Alexey Alexandrovitch. She enjoyed that form of
        communication, which gave opportunity for a refinement and air of
        mystery not afforded by their personal interviews.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 24</h3>

      <p>
        The levee was drawing to a close. People met as they were going away,
        and gossiped of the latest news, of the newly bestowed honors and the
        changes in the positions of the higher functionaries.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If only Countess Marya Borissovna were Minister of War, and
        Princess Vatkovskaya were Commander-in-Chief,&rdquo; said a gray-headed,
        little old man in a gold-embroidered uniform, addressing a tall,
        handsome maid of honor who had questioned him about the new
        appointments.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And me among the adjutants,&rdquo; said the maid of honor,
        smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You have an appointment already. You&rsquo;re over the
        ecclesiastical department. And your assistant&rsquo;s Karenin.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Good-day, prince!&rdquo; said the little old man to a man who
        came up to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What were you saying of Karenin?&rdquo; said the prince.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He and Putyatov have received the Alexander Nevsky.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I thought he had it already.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No. Just look at him,&rdquo; said the little old man, pointing
        with his embroidered hat to Karenin in a court uniform with the new red
        ribbon across his shoulders, standing in the doorway of the hall with an
        influential member of the Imperial Council. &ldquo;Pleased and happy as
        a brass farthing,&rdquo; he added, stopping to shake hands with a
        handsome gentleman of the bedchamber of colossal proportions.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; he&rsquo;s looking older,&rdquo; said the gentleman of the
        bedchamber.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;From overwork. He&rsquo;s always drawing up projects nowadays. He
        won&rsquo;t let a poor devil go nowadays till he&rsquo;s explained it
        all to him under heads.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Looking older, did you say? <i>Il fait des passions</i>. I
        believe Countess Lidia Ivanovna&rsquo;s jealous now of his wife.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, come now, please don&rsquo;t say any harm of Countess Lidia
        Ivanovna.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, is there any harm in her being in love with Karenin?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But is it true Madame Karenina&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, not here in the palace, but in Petersburg. I met her
        yesterday with Alexey Vronsky, <i>bras dessous, bras dessous</i>, in the
        Morsky.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est un homme qui n&rsquo;a pas</i>,...&rdquo; the
        gentleman of the bedchamber was beginning, but he stopped to make room,
        bowing, for a member of the Imperial family to pass.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus people talked incessantly of Alexey Alexandrovitch, finding fault
        with him and laughing at him, while he, blocking up the way of the
        member of the Imperial Council he had captured, was explaining to him
        point by point his new financial project, never interrupting his
        discourse for an instant for fear he should escape.
      </p>

      <p>
        Almost at the same time that his wife left Alexey Alexandrovitch there
        had come to him that bitterest moment in the life of an
        official&mdash;the moment when his upward career comes to a full stop.
        This full stop had arrived and everyone perceived it, but Alexey
        Alexandrovitch himself was not yet aware that his career was over.
        Whether it was due to his feud with Stremov, or his misfortune with his
        wife, or simply that Alexey Alexandrovitch had reached his destined
        limits, it had become evident to everyone in the course of that year
        that his career was at an end. He still filled a position of
        consequence, he sat on many commissions and committees, but he was a man
        whose day was over, and from whom nothing was expected. Whatever he
        said, whatever he proposed, was heard as though it were something long
        familiar, and the very thing that was not needed. But Alexey
        Alexandrovitch was not aware of this, and, on the contrary, being cut
        off from direct participation in governmental activity, he saw more
        clearly than ever the errors and defects in the action of others, and
        thought it his duty to point out means for their correction. Shortly
        after his separation from his wife, he began writing his first note on
        the new judicial procedure, the first of the endless series of notes he
        was destined to write in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch did not merely fail to observe his hopeless
        position in the official world, he was not merely free from anxiety on
        this head, he was positively more satisfied than ever with his own
        activity.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the
        Lord, how he may please the Lord: but he that is married careth for the
        things that are of the world, how he may please his wife,&rdquo; says
        the Apostle Paul, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, who was now guided in every
        action by Scripture, often recalled this text. It seemed to him that
        ever since he had been left without a wife, he had in these very
        projects of reform been serving the Lord more zealously than before.
      </p>

      <p>
        The unmistakable impatience of the member of the Council trying to get
        away from him did not trouble Alexey Alexandrovitch; he gave up his
        exposition only when the member of the Council, seizing his chance when
        one of the Imperial family was passing, slipped away from him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Left alone, Alexey Alexandrovitch looked down, collecting his thoughts,
        then looked casually about him and walked towards the door, where he
        hoped to meet Countess Lidia Ivanovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And how strong they all are, how sound physically,&rdquo; thought
        Alexey Alexandrovitch, looking at the powerfully built gentleman of the
        bedchamber with his well-combed, perfumed whiskers, and at the red neck
        of the prince, pinched by his tight uniform. He had to pass them on his
        way. &ldquo;Truly is it said that all the world is evil,&rdquo; he
        thought, with another sidelong glance at the calves of the gentleman of
        the bedchamber.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moving forward deliberately, Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed with his
        customary air of weariness and dignity to the gentleman who had been
        talking about him, and looking towards the door, his eyes sought
        Countess Lidia Ivanovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! Alexey Alexandrovitch!&rdquo; said the little old man, with a
        malicious light in his eyes, at the moment when Karenin was on a level
        with them, and was nodding with a frigid gesture, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
        congratulated you yet,&rdquo; said the old man, pointing to his newly
        received ribbon.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; answered Alexey Alexandrovitch. &ldquo;What an
        <i>exquisite</i> day today,&rdquo; he added, laying emphasis in his
        peculiar way on the word <i>exquisite</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        That they laughed at him he was well aware, but he did not expect
        anything but hostility from them; he was used to that by now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Catching sight of the yellow shoulders of Lidia Ivanovna jutting out
        above her corset, and her fine pensive eyes bidding him to her, Alexey
        Alexandrovitch smiled, revealing untarnished white teeth, and went
        towards her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lidia Ivanovna&rsquo;s dress had cost her great pains, as indeed all her
        dresses had done of late. Her aim in dress was now quite the reverse of
        that she had pursued thirty years before. Then her desire had been to
        adorn herself with something, and the more adorned the better. Now, on
        the contrary, she was perforce decked out in a way so inconsistent with
        her age and her figure, that her one anxiety was to contrive that the
        contrast between these adornments and her own exterior should not be too
        appalling. And as far as Alexey Alexandrovitch was concerned she
        succeeded, and was in his eyes attractive. For him she was the one
        island not only of goodwill to him, but of love in the midst of the sea
        of hostility and jeering that surrounded him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Passing through rows of ironical eyes, he was drawn as naturally to her
        loving glance as a plant to the sun.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I congratulate you,&rdquo; she said to him, her eyes on his
        ribbon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppressing a smile of pleasure, he shrugged his shoulders, closing his
        eyes, as though to say that that could not be a source of joy to him.
        Countess Lidia Ivanovna was very well aware that it was one of his chief
        sources of satisfaction, though he never admitted it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How is our angel?&rdquo; said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, meaning
        Seryozha.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I was quite pleased with him,&rdquo; said
        Alexey Alexandrovitch, raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes.
        &ldquo;And Sitnikov is not satisfied with him.&rdquo; (Sitnikov was the
        tutor to whom Seryozha&rsquo;s secular education had been intrusted.)
        &ldquo;As I have mentioned to you, there&rsquo;s a sort of coldness in
        him towards the most important questions which ought to touch the heart
        of every man and every child....&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch began
        expounding his views on the sole question that interested him besides
        the service&mdash;the education of his son.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Alexey Alexandrovitch with Lidia Ivanovna&rsquo;s help had been
        brought back anew to life and activity, he felt it his duty to undertake
        the education of the son left on his hands. Having never before taken
        any interest in educational questions, Alexey Alexandrovitch devoted
        some time to the theoretical study of the subject. After reading several
        books on anthropology, education, and didactics, Alexey Alexandrovitch
        drew up a plan of education, and engaging the best tutor in Petersburg
        to superintend it, he set to work, and the subject continually absorbed
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but the heart. I see in him his father&rsquo;s heart, and
        with such a heart a child cannot go far wrong,&rdquo; said Lidia
        Ivanovna with enthusiasm.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, perhaps.... As for me, I do my duty. It&rsquo;s all I can
        do.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming to me,&rdquo; said Countess Lidia Ivanovna,
        after a pause; &ldquo;we have to speak of a subject painful for you. I
        would give anything to have spared you certain memories, but others are
        not of the same mind. I have received a letter from <i>her</i>.
        <i>She</i> is here in Petersburg.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch shuddered at the allusion to his wife, but
        immediately his face assumed the deathlike rigidity which expressed
        utter helplessness in the matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I was expecting it,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Countess Lidia Ivanovna looked at him ecstatically, and tears of rapture
        at the greatness of his soul came into her eyes.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 25</h3>

      <p>
        When Alexey Alexandrovitch came into the Countess Lidia Ivanovna&rsquo;s
        snug little boudoir, decorated with old china and hung with portraits,
        the lady herself had not yet made her appearance.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was changing her dress.
      </p>

      <p>
        A cloth was laid on a round table, and on it stood a china tea service
        and a silver spirit-lamp and tea kettle. Alexey Alexandrovitch looked
        idly about at the endless familiar portraits which adorned the room, and
        sitting down to the table, he opened a New Testament lying upon it. The
        rustle of the countess&rsquo;s silk skirt drew his attention off.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well now, we can sit quietly,&rdquo; said Countess Lidia
        Ivanovna, slipping hurriedly with an agitated smile between the table
        and the sofa, &ldquo;and talk over our tea.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        After some words of preparation, Countess Lidia Ivanovna, breathing hard
        and flushing crimson, gave into Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s hands the
        letter she had received.
      </p>

      <p>
        After reading the letter, he sat a long while in silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have the right to refuse her,&rdquo; he
        said, timidly lifting his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dear friend, you never see evil in anyone!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;On the contrary, I see that all is evil. But whether it is
        just....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        His face showed irresolution, and a seeking for counsel, support, and
        guidance in a matter he did not understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Countess Lidia Ivanovna interrupted him; &ldquo;there
        are limits to everything. I can understand immorality,&rdquo; she said,
        not quite truthfully, since she never could understand that which leads
        women to immorality; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t understand cruelty: to
        whom? to you! How can she stay in the town where you are? No, the longer
        one lives the more one learns. And I&rsquo;m learning to understand your
        loftiness and her baseness.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who is to throw a stone?&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch,
        unmistakably pleased with the part he had to play. &ldquo;I have
        forgiven all, and so I cannot deprive her of what is exacted by love in
        her&mdash;by her love for her son....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But is that love, my friend? Is it sincere? Admitting that you
        have forgiven&mdash;that you forgive&mdash;have we the right to work on
        the feelings of that angel? He looks on her as dead. He prays for her,
        and beseeches God to have mercy on her sins. And it is better so. But
        now what will he think?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I had not thought of that,&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch,
        evidently agreeing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Countess Lidia Ivanovna hid her face in her hands and was silent. She
        was praying.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you ask my advice,&rdquo; she said, having finished her prayer
        and uncovered her face, &ldquo;I do not advise you to do this. Do you
        suppose I don&rsquo;t see how you are suffering, how this has torn open
        your wounds? But supposing that, as always, you don&rsquo;t think of
        yourself, what can it lead to?&mdash;to fresh suffering for you, to
        torture for the child. If there were a trace of humanity left in her,
        she ought not to wish for it herself. No, I have no hesitation in saying
        I advise not, and if you will intrust it to me, I will write to
        her.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Alexey Alexandrovitch consented, and Countess Lidia Ivanovna sent
        the following letter in French:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <div>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Dear Madame,
          </p>

          <p>
            &ldquo;To be reminded of you might have results for your son in
            leading to questions on his part which could not be answered without
            implanting in the child&rsquo;s soul a spirit of censure towards
            what should be for him sacred, and therefore I beg you to interpret
            your husband&rsquo;s refusal in the spirit of Christian love. I pray
            to Almighty God to have mercy on you.
          </p>

          <p class="right">
            &ldquo;Countess Lidia.&rdquo;
          </p>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This letter attained the secret object which Countess Lidia Ivanovna had
        concealed from herself. It wounded Anna to the quick.
      </p>

      <p>
        For his part, Alexey Alexandrovitch, on returning home from Lidia
        Ivanovna&rsquo;s, could not all that day concentrate himself on his
        usual pursuits, and find that spiritual peace of one saved and believing
        which he had felt of late.
      </p>

      <p>
        The thought of his wife, who had so greatly sinned against him, and
        towards whom he had been so saintly, as Countess Lidia Ivanovna had so
        justly told him, ought not to have troubled him; but he was not easy; he
        could not understand the book he was reading; he could not drive away
        harassing recollections of his relations with her, of the mistake which,
        as it now seemed, he had made in regard to her. The memory of how he had
        received her confession of infidelity on their way home from the races
        (especially that he had insisted only on the observance of external
        decorum, and had not sent a challenge) tortured him like a remorse. He
        was tortured too by the thought of the letter he had written her; and
        most of all, his forgiveness, which nobody wanted, and his care of the
        other man&rsquo;s child made his heart burn with shame and remorse.
      </p>

      <p>
        And just the same feeling of shame and regret he felt now, as he
        reviewed all his past with her, recalling the awkward words in which,
        after long wavering, he had made her an offer.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But how have I been to blame?&rdquo; he said to himself. And this
        question always excited another question in him&mdash;whether they felt
        differently, did their loving and marrying differently, these Vronskys
        and Oblonskys ... these gentlemen of the bedchamber, with their fine
        calves. And there passed before his mind a whole series of these
        mettlesome, vigorous, self-confident men, who always and everywhere drew
        his inquisitive attention in spite of himself. He tried to dispel these
        thoughts, he tried to persuade himself that he was not living for this
        transient life, but for the life of eternity, and that there was peace
        and love in his heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the fact that he had in this transient, trivial life made, as it
        seemed to him, a few trivial mistakes tortured him as though the eternal
        salvation in which he believed had no existence. But this temptation did
        not last long, and soon there was reestablished once more in Alexey
        Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s soul the peace and the elevation by virtue of
        which he could forget what he did not want to remember.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 26</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, Kapitonitch?&rdquo; said Seryozha, coming back rosy and
        good-humored from his walk the day before his birthday, and giving his
        overcoat to the tall old hall-porter, who smiled down at the little
        person from the height of his long figure. &ldquo;Well, has the bandaged
        clerk been here today? Did papa see him?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He saw him. The minute the chief secretary came out, I announced
        him,&rdquo; said the hall-porter with a good-humored wink. &ldquo;Here,
        I&rsquo;ll take it off.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Seryozha!&rdquo; said the tutor, stopping in the doorway leading
        to the inner rooms. &ldquo;Take it off yourself.&rdquo; But Seryozha,
        though he heard his tutor&rsquo;s feeble voice, did not pay attention to
        it. He stood keeping hold of the hall-porter&rsquo;s belt, and gazing
        into his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and did papa do what he wanted for him?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The hall-porter nodded his head affirmatively. The clerk with his face
        tied up, who had already been seven times to ask some favor of Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, interested both Seryozha and the hall-porter. Seryozha
        had come upon him in the hall, and had heard him plaintively beg the
        hall-porter to announce him, saying that he and his children had death
        staring them in the face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since then Seryozha, having met him a second time in the hall, took
        great interest in him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, was he very glad?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Glad? I should think so! Almost dancing as he walked away.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And has anything been left?&rdquo; asked Seryozha, after a pause.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, sir,&rdquo; said the hall-porter; then with a shake of his
        head he whispered, &ldquo;Something from the countess.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Seryozha understood at once that what the hall-porter was speaking of
        was a present from Countess Lidia Ivanovna for his birthday.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you say? Where?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Korney took it to your papa. A fine plaything it must be
        too!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How big? Like this?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Rather small, but a fine thing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A book.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, a thing. Run along, run along, Vassily Lukitch is calling
        you,&rdquo; said the porter, hearing the tutor&rsquo;s steps
        approaching, and carefully taking away from his belt the little hand in
        the glove half pulled off, he signed with his head towards the tutor.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Vassily Lukitch, in a tiny minute!&rdquo; answered Seryozha with
        that gay and loving smile which always won over the conscientious
        Vassily Lukitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seryozha was too happy, everything was too delightful for him to be able
        to help sharing with his friend the porter the family good fortune of
        which he had heard during his walk in the public gardens from Lidia
        Ivanovna&rsquo;s niece. This piece of good news seemed to him
        particularly important from its coming at the same time with the
        gladness of the bandaged clerk and his own gladness at toys having come
        for him. It seemed to Seryozha that this was a day on which everyone
        ought to be glad and happy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You know papa&rsquo;s received the Alexander Nevsky today?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To be sure I do! People have been already to congratulate
        him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And is he glad?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Glad at the Tsar&rsquo;s gracious favor! I should think so!
        It&rsquo;s a proof he&rsquo;s deserved it,&rdquo; said the porter
        severely and seriously.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seryozha fell to dreaming, gazing up at the face of the porter, which he
        had thoroughly studied in every detail, especially the chin that hung
        down between the gray whiskers, never seen by anyone but Seryozha, who
        saw him only from below.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and has your daughter been to see you lately?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The porter&rsquo;s daughter was a ballet dancer.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;When is she to come on week-days? They&rsquo;ve their lessons to
        learn too. And you&rsquo;ve your lesson, sir; run along.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        On coming into the room, Seryozha, instead of sitting down to his
        lessons, told his tutor of his supposition that what had been brought
        him must be a machine. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; he inquired.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Vassily Lukitch was thinking of nothing but the necessity of
        learning the grammar lesson for the teacher, who was coming at two.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, do just tell me, Vassily Lukitch,&rdquo; he asked suddenly,
        when he was seated at their work table with the book in his hands,
        &ldquo;what is greater than the Alexander Nevsky? You know papa&rsquo;s
        received the Alexander Nevsky?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vassily Lukitch replied that the Vladimir was greater than the Alexander
        Nevsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And higher still?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, highest of all is the Andrey Pervozvanny.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And higher than the Andrey?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What, you don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; and Seryozha, leaning on his
        elbows, sank into deep meditation.
      </p>

      <p>
        His meditations were of the most complex and diverse character. He
        imagined his father&rsquo;s having suddenly been presented with both the
        Vladimir and the Andrey today, and in consequence being much better
        tempered at his lesson, and dreamed how, when he was grown up, he would
        himself receive all the orders, and what they might invent higher than
        the Andrey. Directly any higher order were invented, he would win it.
        They would make a higher one still, and he would immediately win that
        too.
      </p>

      <p>
        The time passed in such meditations, and when the teacher came, the
        lesson about the adverbs of place and time and manner of action was not
        ready, and the teacher was not only displeased, but hurt. This touched
        Seryozha. He felt he was not to blame for not having learned the lesson;
        however much he tried, he was utterly unable to do that. As long as the
        teacher was explaining to him, he believed him and seemed to comprehend,
        but as soon as he was left alone, he was positively unable to recollect
        and to understand that the short and familiar word
        &ldquo;suddenly&rdquo; is an adverb of manner of action. Still he was
        sorry that he had disappointed the teacher.
      </p>

      <p>
        He chose a moment when the teacher was looking in silence at the book.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mihail Ivanitch, when is your birthday?&rdquo; he asked all, of a
        sudden.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;d much better be thinking about your work. Birthdays
        are of no importance to a rational being. It&rsquo;s a day like any
        other on which one has to do one&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Seryozha looked intently at the teacher, at his scanty beard, at his
        spectacles, which had slipped down below the ridge on his nose, and fell
        into so deep a reverie that he heard nothing of what the teacher was
        explaining to him. He knew that the teacher did not think what he said;
        he felt it from the tone in which it was said. &ldquo;But why have they
        all agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and
        most useless stuff? Why does he keep me off; why doesn&rsquo;t he love
        me?&rdquo; he asked himself mournfully, and could not think of an
        answer.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 27</h3>

      <p>
        After the lesson with the grammar teacher came his father&rsquo;s
        lesson. While waiting for his father, Seryozha sat at the table playing
        with a penknife, and fell to dreaming. Among Seryozha&rsquo;s favorite
        occupations was searching for his mother during his walks. He did not
        believe in death generally, and in her death in particular, in spite of
        what Lidia Ivanovna had told him and his father had confirmed, and it
        was just because of that, and after he had been told she was dead, that
        he had begun looking for her when out for a walk. Every woman of full,
        graceful figure with dark hair was his mother. At the sight of such a
        woman such a feeling of tenderness was stirred within him that his
        breath failed him, and tears came into his eyes. And he was on the
        tiptoe of expectation that she would come up to him, would lift her
        veil. All her face would be visible, she would smile, she would hug him,
        he would sniff her fragrance, feel the softness of her arms, and cry
        with happiness, just as he had one evening lain on her lap while she
        tickled him, and he laughed and bit her white, ring-covered fingers.
        Later, when he accidentally learned from his old nurse that his mother
        was not dead, and his father and Lidia Ivanovna had explained to him
        that she was dead to him because she was wicked (which he could not
        possibly believe, because he loved her), he went on seeking her and
        expecting her in the same way. That day in the public gardens there had
        been a lady in a lilac veil, whom he had watched with a throbbing heart,
        believing it to be she as she came towards them along the path. The lady
        had not come up to them, but had disappeared somewhere. That day, more
        intensely than ever, Seryozha felt a rush of love for her, and now,
        waiting for his father, he forgot everything, and cut all round the edge
        of the table with his penknife, staring straight before him with
        sparkling eyes and dreaming of her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here is your papa!&rdquo; said Vassily Lukitch, rousing him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seryozha jumped up and went up to his father, and kissing his hand,
        looked at him intently, trying to discover signs of his joy at receiving
        the Alexander Nevsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you have a nice walk?&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch,
        sitting down in his easy chair, pulling the volume of the Old Testament
        to him and opening it. Although Alexey Alexandrovitch had more than once
        told Seryozha that every Christian ought to know Scripture history
        thoroughly, he often referred to the Bible himself during the lesson,
        and Seryozha observed this.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it was very nice indeed, papa,&rdquo; said Seryozha, sitting
        sideways on his chair and rocking it, which was forbidden. &ldquo;I saw
        Nadinka&rdquo; (Nadinka was a niece of Lidia Ivanovna&rsquo;s who was
        being brought up in her house). &ldquo;She told me you&rsquo;d been
        given a new star. Are you glad, papa?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;First of all, don&rsquo;t rock your chair, please,&rdquo; said
        Alexey Alexandrovitch. &ldquo;And secondly, it&rsquo;s not the reward
        that&rsquo;s precious, but the work itself. And I could have wished you
        understood that. If you now are going to work, to study in order to win
        a reward, then the work will seem hard to you; but when you work&rdquo;
        (Alexey Alexandrovitch, as he spoke, thought of how he had been
        sustained by a sense of duty through the wearisome labor of the morning,
        consisting of signing one hundred and eighty papers), &ldquo;loving your
        work, you will find your reward in it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Seryozha&rsquo;s eyes, that had been shining with gaiety and tenderness,
        grew dull and dropped before his father&rsquo;s gaze. This was the same
        long-familiar tone his father always took with him, and Seryozha had
        learned by now to fall in with it. His father always talked to
        him&mdash;so Seryozha felt&mdash;as though he were addressing some boy
        of his own imagination, one of those boys that exist in books, utterly
        unlike himself. And Seryozha always tried with his father to act being
        the story-book boy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You understand that, I hope?&rdquo; said his father.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, papa,&rdquo; answered Seryozha, acting the part of the
        imaginary boy.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lesson consisted of learning by heart several verses out of the
        Gospel and the repetition of the beginning of the Old Testament. The
        verses from the Gospel Seryozha knew fairly well, but at the moment when
        he was saying them he became so absorbed in watching the sharply
        protruding, bony knobbiness of his father&rsquo;s forehead, that he lost
        the thread, and he transposed the end of one verse and the beginning of
        another. So it was evident to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he did not
        understand what he was saying, and that irritated him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He frowned, and began explaining what Seryozha had heard many times
        before and never could remember, because he understood it too well, just
        as that &ldquo;suddenly&rdquo; is an adverb of manner of action.
        Seryozha looked with scared eyes at his father, and could think of
        nothing but whether his father would make him repeat what he had said,
        as he sometimes did. And this thought so alarmed Seryozha that he now
        understood nothing. But his father did not make him repeat it, and
        passed on to the lesson out of the Old Testament. Seryozha recounted the
        events themselves well enough, but when he had to answer questions as to
        what certain events prefigured, he knew nothing, though he had already
        been punished over this lesson. The passage at which he was utterly
        unable to say anything, and began fidgeting and cutting the table and
        swinging his chair, was where he had to repeat the patriarchs before the
        Flood. He did not know one of them, except Enoch, who had been taken up
        alive to heaven. Last time he had remembered their names, but now he had
        forgotten them utterly, chiefly because Enoch was the personage he liked
        best in the whole of the Old Testament, and Enoch&rsquo;s translation to
        heaven was connected in his mind with a whole long train of thought, in
        which he became absorbed now while he gazed with fascinated eyes at his
        father&rsquo;s watch-chain and a half-unbuttoned button on his
        waistcoat.
      </p>

      <p>
        In death, of which they talked to him so often, Seryozha disbelieved
        entirely. He did not believe that those he loved could die, above all
        that he himself would die. That was to him something utterly
        inconceivable and impossible. But he had been told that all men die; he
        had asked people, indeed, whom he trusted, and they too, had confirmed
        it; his old nurse, too, said the same, though reluctantly. But Enoch had
        not died, and so it followed that everyone did not die. &ldquo;And why
        cannot anyone else so serve God and be taken alive to heaven?&rdquo;
        thought Seryozha. Bad people, that is those Seryozha did not like, they
        might die, but the good might all be like Enoch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what are the names of the patriarchs?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Enoch, Enos&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you have said that already. This is bad, Seryozha, very bad.
        If you don&rsquo;t try to learn what is more necessary than anything for
        a Christian,&rdquo; said his father, getting up, &ldquo;whatever can
        interest you? I am displeased with you, and Piotr Ignatitch&rdquo; (this
        was the most important of his teachers) &ldquo;is displeased with
        you.... I shall have to punish you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        His father and his teacher were both displeased with Seryozha, and he
        certainly did learn his lessons very badly. But still it could not be
        said he was a stupid boy. On the contrary, he was far cleverer than the
        boys his teacher held up as examples to Seryozha. In his father&rsquo;s
        opinion, he did not want to learn what he was taught. In reality he
        could not learn that. He could not, because the claims of his own soul
        were more binding on him than those claims his father and his teacher
        made upon him. Those claims were in opposition, and he was in direct
        conflict with his education. He was nine years old; he was a child; but
        he knew his own soul, it was precious to him, he guarded it as the
        eyelid guards the eye, and without the key of love he let no one into
        his soul. His teachers complained that he would not learn, while his
        soul was brimming over with thirst for knowledge. And he learned from
        Kapitonitch, from his nurse, from Nadinka, from Vassily Lukitch, but not
        from his teachers. The spring his father and his teachers reckoned upon
        to turn their mill-wheels had long dried up at the source, but its
        waters did their work in another channel.
      </p>

      <p>
        His father punished Seryozha by not letting him go to see Nadinka, Lidia
        Ivanovna&rsquo;s niece; but this punishment turned out happily for
        Seryozha. Vassily Lukitch was in a good humor, and showed him how to
        make windmills. The whole evening passed over this work and in dreaming
        how to make a windmill on which he could turn himself&mdash;clutching at
        the sails or tying himself on and whirling round. Of his mother Seryozha
        did not think all the evening, but when he had gone to bed, he suddenly
        remembered her, and prayed in his own words that his mother tomorrow for
        his birthday might leave off hiding herself and come to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Vassily Lukitch, do you know what I prayed for tonight extra
        besides the regular things?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That you might learn your lessons better?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Toys?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No. You&rsquo;ll never guess. A splendid thing; but it&rsquo;s a
        secret! When it comes to pass I&rsquo;ll tell you. Can&rsquo;t you
        guess!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t guess. You tell me,&rdquo; said Vassily Lukitch
        with a smile, which was rare with him. &ldquo;Come, lie down, I&rsquo;m
        putting out the candle.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Without the candle I can see better what I see and what I prayed
        for. There! I was almost telling the secret!&rdquo; said Seryozha,
        laughing gaily.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the candle was taken away, Seryozha heard and felt his mother. She
        stood over him, and with loving eyes caressed him. But then came
        windmills, a knife, everything began to be mixed up, and he fell asleep.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 28</h3>

      <p>
        On arriving in Petersburg, Vronsky and Anna stayed at one of the best
        hotels; Vronsky apart in a lower story, Anna above with her child, its
        nurse, and her maid, in a large suite of four rooms.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the day of his arrival Vronsky went to his brother&rsquo;s. There he
        found his mother, who had come from Moscow on business. His mother and
        sister-in-law greeted him as usual: they asked him about his stay
        abroad, and talked of their common acquaintances, but did not let drop a
        single word in allusion to his connection with Anna. His brother came
        the next morning to see Vronsky, and of his own accord asked him about
        her, and Alexey Vronsky told him directly that he looked upon his
        connection with Madame Karenina as marriage; that he hoped to arrange a
        divorce, and then to marry her, and until then he considered her as much
        a wife as any other wife, and he begged him to tell their mother and his
        wife so.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If the world disapproves, I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said
        Vronsky; &ldquo;but if my relations want to be on terms of relationship
        with me, they will have to be on the same terms with my wife.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The elder brother, who had always a respect for his younger
        brother&rsquo;s judgment, could not well tell whether he was right or
        not till the world had decided the question; for his part he had nothing
        against it, and with Alexey he went up to see Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before his brother, as before everyone, Vronsky addressed Anna with a
        certain formality, treating her as he might a very intimate friend, but
        it was understood that his brother knew their real relations, and they
        talked about Anna&rsquo;s going to Vronsky&rsquo;s estate.
      </p>

      <p>
        In spite of all his social experience Vronsky was, in consequence of the
        new position in which he was placed, laboring under a strange
        misapprehension. One would have thought he must have understood that
        society was closed for him and Anna; but now some vague ideas had sprung
        up in his brain that this was only the case in old-fashioned days, and
        that now with the rapidity of modern progress (he had unconsciously
        become by now a partisan of every sort of progress) the views of society
        had changed, and that the question whether they would be received in
        society was not a foregone conclusion. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he
        thought, &ldquo;she would not be received at court, but intimate friends
        can and must look at it in the proper light.&rdquo; One may sit for
        several hours at a stretch with one&rsquo;s legs crossed in the same
        position, if one knows that there&rsquo;s nothing to prevent one&rsquo;s
        changing one&rsquo;s position; but if a man knows that he must remain
        sitting so with crossed legs, then cramps come on, the legs begin to
        twitch and to strain towards the spot to which one would like to draw
        them. This was what Vronsky was experiencing in regard to the world.
        Though at the bottom of his heart he knew that the world was shut on
        them, he put it to the test whether the world had not changed by now and
        would not receive them. But he very quickly perceived that though the
        world was open for him personally, it was closed for Anna. Just as in
        the game of cat and mouse, the hands raised for him were dropped to bar
        the way for Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the first ladies of Petersburg society whom Vronsky saw was his
        cousin Betsy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; she greeted him joyfully. &ldquo;And Anna? How
        glad I am! Where are you stopping? I can fancy after your delightful
        travels you must find our poor Petersburg horrid. I can fancy your
        honeymoon in Rome. How about the divorce? Is that all over?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky noticed that Betsy&rsquo;s enthusiasm waned when she learned
        that no divorce had as yet taken place.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;People will throw stones at me, I know,&rdquo; she said,
        &ldquo;but I shall come and see Anna; yes, I shall certainly come. You
        won&rsquo;t be here long, I suppose?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And she did certainly come to see Anna the same day, but her tone was
        not at all the same as in former days. She unmistakably prided herself
        on her courage, and wished Anna to appreciate the fidelity of her
        friendship. She only stayed ten minutes, talking of society gossip, and
        on leaving she said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never told me when the divorce is to be? Supposing
        I&rsquo;m ready to fling my cap over the mill, other starchy people will
        give you the cold shoulder until you&rsquo;re married. And that&rsquo;s
        so simple nowadays. <i>Ça se fait</i>. So you&rsquo;re going on Friday?
        Sorry we shan&rsquo;t see each other again.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        From Betsy&rsquo;s tone Vronsky might have grasped what he had to expect
        from the world; but he made another effort in his own family. His mother
        he did not reckon upon. He knew that his mother, who had been so
        enthusiastic over Anna at their first acquaintance, would have no mercy
        on her now for having ruined her son&rsquo;s career. But he had more
        hope of Varya, his brother&rsquo;s wife. He fancied she would not throw
        stones, and would go simply and directly to see Anna, and would receive
        her in her own house.
      </p>

      <p>
        The day after his arrival Vronsky went to her, and finding her alone,
        expressed his wishes directly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You know, Alexey,&rdquo; she said after hearing him, &ldquo;how
        fond I am of you, and how ready I am to do anything for you; but I have
        not spoken, because I knew I could be of no use to you and to Anna
        Arkadyevna,&rdquo; she said, articulating the name &ldquo;Anna
        Arkadyevna&rdquo; with particular care. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose,
        please, that I judge her. Never; perhaps in her place I should have done
        the same. I don&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t enter into that,&rdquo; she
        said, glancing timidly at his gloomy face. &ldquo;But one must call
        things by their names. You want me to go and see her, to ask her here,
        and to rehabilitate her in society; but do understand that
        <i>I cannot</i> do so. I have daughters growing up, and I must live in
        the world for my husband&rsquo;s sake. Well, I&rsquo;m ready to come and
        see Anna Arkadyevna: she will understand that I can&rsquo;t ask her
        here, or I should have to do so in such a way that she would not meet
        people who look at things differently; that would offend her. I
        can&rsquo;t raise her....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t regard her as fallen more than hundreds of
        women you do receive!&rdquo; Vronsky interrupted her still more
        gloomily, and he got up in silence, understanding that his
        sister-in-law&rsquo;s decision was not to be shaken.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey! don&rsquo;t be angry with me. Please understand that
        I&rsquo;m not to blame,&rdquo; began Varya, looking at him with a timid
        smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not angry with you,&rdquo; he said still as gloomily;
        &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sorry in two ways. I&rsquo;m sorry, too, that this
        means breaking up our friendship&mdash;if not breaking up, at least
        weakening it. You will understand that for me, too, it cannot be
        otherwise.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And with that he left her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky knew that further efforts were useless, and that he had to spend
        these few days in Petersburg as though in a strange town, avoiding every
        sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to be exposed to
        the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable to him. One of
        the most unpleasant features of his position in Petersburg was that
        Alexey Alexandrovitch and his name seemed to meet him everywhere. He
        could not begin to talk of anything without the conversation turning on
        Alexey Alexandrovitch; he could not go anywhere without risk of meeting
        him. So at least it seemed to Vronsky, just as it seems to a man with a
        sore finger that he is continually, as though on purpose, grazing his
        sore finger on everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their stay in Petersburg was the more painful to Vronsky that he
        perceived all the time a sort of new mood that he could not understand
        in Anna. At one time she would seem in love with him, and then she would
        become cold, irritable, and impenetrable. She was worrying over
        something, and keeping something back from him, and did not seem to
        notice the humiliations which poisoned his existence, and for her, with
        her delicate intuition, must have been still more unbearable.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 29</h3>

      <p>
        One of Anna&rsquo;s objects in coming back to Russia had been to see her
        son. From the day she left Italy the thought of it had never ceased to
        agitate her. And as she got nearer to Petersburg, the delight and
        importance of this meeting grew ever greater in her imagination. She did
        not even put to herself the question how to arrange it. It seemed to her
        natural and simple to see her son when she should be in the same town
        with him. But on her arrival in Petersburg she was suddenly made
        distinctly aware of her present position in society, and she grasped the
        fact that to arrange this meeting was no easy matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        She had now been two days in Petersburg. The thought of her son never
        left her for a single instant, but she had not yet seen him. To go
        straight to the house, where she might meet Alexey Alexandrovitch, that
        she felt she had no right to do. She might be refused admittance and
        insulted. To write and so enter into relations with her
        husband&mdash;that it made her miserable to think of doing; she could
        only be at peace when she did not think of her husband. To get a glimpse
        of her son out walking, finding out where and when he went out, was not
        enough for her; she had so looked forward to this meeting, she had so
        much she must say to him, she so longed to embrace him, to kiss him.
        Seryozha&rsquo;s old nurse might be a help to her and show her what to
        do. But the nurse was not now living in Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s
        house. In this uncertainty, and in efforts to find the nurse, two days
        had slipped by.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hearing of the close intimacy between Alexey Alexandrovitch and Countess
        Lidia Ivanovna, Anna decided on the third day to write to her a letter,
        which cost her great pains, and in which she intentionally said that
        permission to see her son must depend on her husband&rsquo;s generosity.
        She knew that if the letter were shown to her husband, he would keep up
        his character of magnanimity, and would not refuse her request.
      </p>

      <p>
        The commissionaire who took the letter had brought her back the most
        cruel and unexpected answer, that there was no answer. She had never
        felt so humiliated as at the moment when, sending for the
        commissionaire, she heard from him the exact account of how he had
        waited, and how afterwards he had been told there was no answer. Anna
        felt humiliated, insulted, but she saw that from her point of view
        Countess Lidia Ivanovna was right. Her suffering was the more poignant
        that she had to bear it in solitude. She could not and would not share
        it with Vronsky. She knew that to him, although he was the primary cause
        of her distress, the question of her seeing her son would seem a matter
        of very little consequence. She knew that he would never be capable of
        understanding all the depth of her suffering, that for his cool tone at
        any allusion to it she would begin to hate him. And she dreaded that
        more than anything in the world, and so she hid from him everything that
        related to her son. Spending the whole day at home she considered ways
        of seeing her son, and had reached a decision to write to her husband.
        She was just composing this letter when she was handed the letter from
        Lidia Ivanovna. The countess&rsquo;s silence had subdued and depressed
        her, but the letter, all that she read between the lines in it, so
        exasperated her, this malice was so revolting beside her passionate,
        legitimate tenderness for her son, that she turned against other people
        and left off blaming herself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This coldness&mdash;this pretense of feeling!&rdquo; she said to
        herself. &ldquo;They must needs insult me and torture the child, and I
        am to submit to it! Not on any consideration! She is worse than I am. I
        don&rsquo;t lie, anyway.&rdquo; And she decided on the spot that next
        day, Seryozha&rsquo;s birthday, she would go straight to her
        husband&rsquo;s house, bribe or deceive the servants, but at any cost
        see her son and overturn the hideous deception with which they were
        encompassing the unhappy child.
      </p>

      <p>
        She went to a toy shop, bought toys and thought over a plan of action.
        She would go early in the morning at eight o&rsquo;clock, when Alexey
        Alexandrovitch would be certain not to be up. She would have money in
        her hand to give the hall-porter and the footman, so that they should
        let her in, and not raising her veil, she would say that she had come
        from Seryozha&rsquo;s godfather to congratulate him, and that she had
        been charged to leave the toys at his bedside. She had prepared
        everything but the words she should say to her son. Often as she had
        dreamed of it, she could never think of anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next day, at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Anna got out of a
        hired sledge and rang at the front entrance of her former home.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Run and see what&rsquo;s wanted. Some lady,&rdquo; said
        Kapitonitch, who, not yet dressed, in his overcoat and galoshes, had
        peeped out of the window and seen a lady in a veil standing close up to
        the door. His assistant, a lad Anna did not know, had no sooner opened
        the door to her than she came in, and pulling a three-rouble note out of
        her muff put it hurriedly into his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Seryozha&mdash;Sergey Alexeitch,&rdquo; she said, and was going
        on. Scrutinizing the note, the porter&rsquo;s assistant stopped her at
        the second glass door.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Whom do you want?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        She did not hear his words and made no answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Noticing the embarrassment of the unknown lady, Kapitonitch went out to
        her, opened the second door for her, and asked her what she was pleased
        to want.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;From Prince Skorodumov for Sergey Alexeitch,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;His honor&rsquo;s not up yet,&rdquo; said the porter, looking at
        her attentively.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna had not anticipated that the absolutely unchanged hall of the house
        where she had lived for nine years would so greatly affect her. Memories
        sweet and painful rose one after another in her heart, and for a moment
        she forgot what she was here for.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Would you kindly wait?&rdquo; said Kapitonitch, taking off her
        fur cloak.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he took off the cloak, Kapitonitch glanced at her face, recognized
        her, and made her a low bow in silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Please walk in, your excellency,&rdquo; he said to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        She tried to say something, but her voice refused to utter any sound;
        with a guilty and imploring glance at the old man she went with light,
        swift steps up the stairs. Bent double, and his galoshes catching in the
        steps, Kapitonitch ran after her, trying to overtake her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The tutor&rsquo;s there; maybe he&rsquo;s not dressed. I&rsquo;ll
        let him know.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna still mounted the familiar staircase, not understanding what the
        old man was saying.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This way, to the left, if you please. Excuse its not being tidy.
        His honor&rsquo;s in the old parlor now,&rdquo; the hall-porter said,
        panting. &ldquo;Excuse me, wait a little, your excellency; I&rsquo;ll
        just see,&rdquo; he said, and overtaking her, he opened the high door
        and disappeared behind it. Anna stood still waiting. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
        only just awake,&rdquo; said the hall-porter, coming out. And at the
        very instant the porter said this, Anna caught the sound of a childish
        yawn. From the sound of this yawn alone she knew her son and seemed to
        see him living before her eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let me in; go away!&rdquo; she said, and went in through the high
        doorway. On the right of the door stood a bed, and sitting up in the bed
        was the boy. His little body bent forward with his nightshirt
        unbuttoned, he was stretching and still yawning. The instant his lips
        came together they curved into a blissfully sleepy smile, and with that
        smile he slowly and deliciously rolled back again.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Seryozha!&rdquo; she whispered, going noiselessly up to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she was parted from him, and all this latter time when she had been
        feeling a fresh rush of love for him, she had pictured him as he was at
        four years old, when she had loved him most of all. Now he was not even
        the same as when she had left him; he was still further from the
        four-year-old baby, more grown and thinner. How thin his face was, how
        short his hair was! What long hands! How he had changed since she left
        him! But it was he with his head, his lips, his soft neck and broad
        little shoulders.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Seryozha!&rdquo; she repeated just in the child&rsquo;s ear.
      </p>

      <p>
        He raised himself again on his elbow, turned his tangled head from side
        to side as though looking for something, and opened his eyes. Slowly and
        inquiringly he looked for several seconds at his mother standing
        motionless before him, then all at once he smiled a blissful smile, and
        shutting his eyes, rolled not backwards but towards her into her arms.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Seryozha! my darling boy!&rdquo; she said, breathing hard and
        putting her arms round his plump little body. &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; he
        said, wriggling about in her arms so as to touch her hands with
        different parts of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Smiling sleepily still with closed eyes, he flung fat little arms round
        her shoulders, rolled towards her, with the delicious sleepy warmth and
        fragrance that is only found in children, and began rubbing his face
        against her neck and shoulders.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, opening his eyes; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s my
        birthday today. I knew you&rsquo;d come. I&rsquo;ll get up
        directly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And saying that he dropped asleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna looked at him hungrily; she saw how he had grown and changed in her
        absence. She knew, and did not know, the bare legs so long now, that
        were thrust out below the quilt, those short-cropped curls on his neck
        in which she had so often kissed him. She touched all this and could say
        nothing; tears choked her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What are you crying for, mother?&rdquo; he said, waking
        completely up. &ldquo;Mother, what are you crying for?&rdquo; he cried
        in a tearful voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t cry ... I&rsquo;m crying for joy. It&rsquo;s so
        long since I&rsquo;ve seen you. I won&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she
        said, gulping down her tears and turning away. &ldquo;Come, it&rsquo;s
        time for you to dress now,&rdquo; she added, after a pause, and, never
        letting go his hands, she sat down by his bedside on the chair, where
        his clothes were put ready for him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you dress without me? How....&rdquo; she tried to begin
        talking simply and cheerfully, but she could not, and again she turned
        away.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a cold bath, papa didn&rsquo;t order it. And
        you&rsquo;ve not seen Vassily Lukitch? He&rsquo;ll come in soon. Why,
        you&rsquo;re sitting on my clothes!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Seryozha went off into a peal of laughter. She looked at him and
        smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mother, darling, sweet one!&rdquo; he shouted, flinging himself
        on her again and hugging her. It was as though only now, on seeing her
        smile, he fully grasped what had happened.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want that on,&rdquo; he said, taking off her hat.
        And as it were, seeing her afresh without her hat, he fell to kissing
        her again.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what did you think about me? You didn&rsquo;t think I was
        dead?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I never believed it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t believe it, my sweet?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I knew, I knew!&rdquo; he repeated his favorite phrase, and
        snatching the hand that was stroking his hair, he pressed the open palm
        to his mouth and kissed it.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 30</h3>

      <p>
        Meanwhile Vassily Lukitch had not at first understood who this lady was,
        and had learned from their conversation that it was no other person than
        the mother who had left her husband, and whom he had not seen, as he had
        entered the house after her departure. He was in doubt whether to go in
        or not, or whether to communicate with Alexey Alexandrovitch. Reflecting
        finally that his duty was to get Seryozha up at the hour fixed, and that
        it was therefore not his business to consider who was there, the mother
        or anyone else, but simply to do his duty, he finished dressing, went to
        the door and opened it.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the embraces of the mother and child, the sound of their voices, and
        what they were saying, made him change his mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        He shook his head, and with a sigh he closed the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
        wait another ten minutes,&rdquo; he said to himself, clearing his throat
        and wiping away tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        Among the servants of the household there was intense excitement all
        this time. All had heard that their mistress had come, and that
        Kapitonitch had let her in, and that she was even now in the nursery,
        and that their master always went in person to the nursery at nine
        o&rsquo;clock, and everyone fully comprehended that it was impossible
        for the husband and wife to meet, and that they must prevent it. Korney,
        the valet, going down to the hall-porter&rsquo;s room, asked who had let
        her in, and how it was he had done so, and ascertaining that Kapitonitch
        had admitted her and shown her up, he gave the old man a talking-to. The
        hall-porter was doggedly silent, but when Korney told him he ought to be
        sent away, Kapitonitch darted up to him, and waving his hands in
        Korney&rsquo;s face, began:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh yes, to be sure you&rsquo;d not have let her in! After ten
        years&rsquo; service, and never a word but of kindness, and there
        you&rsquo;d up and say, &lsquo;Be off, go along, get away with
        you!&rsquo; Oh yes, you&rsquo;re a shrewd one at politics, I dare say!
        You don&rsquo;t need to be taught how to swindle the master, and to
        filch fur coats!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Soldier!&rdquo; said Korney contemptuously, and he turned to the
        nurse who was coming in. &ldquo;Here, what do you think, Marya Efimovna:
        he let her in without a word to anyone,&rdquo; Korney said addressing
        her. &ldquo;Alexey Alexandrovitch will be down immediately&mdash;and go
        into the nursery!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A pretty business, a pretty business!&rdquo; said the nurse.
        &ldquo;You, Korney Vassilievitch, you&rsquo;d best keep him some way or
        other, the master, while I&rsquo;ll run and get her away somehow. A
        pretty business!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        When the nurse went into the nursery, Seryozha was telling his mother
        how he and Nadinka had had a fall in sledging downhill, and had turned
        over three times. She was listening to the sound of his voice, watching
        his face and the play of expression on it, touching his hand, but she
        did not follow what he was saying. She must go, she must leave
        him,&mdash;this was the only thing she was thinking and feeling. She
        heard the steps of Vassily Lukitch coming up to the door and coughing;
        she heard, too, the steps of the nurse as she came near; but she sat
        like one turned to stone, incapable of beginning to speak or to get up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mistress, darling!&rdquo; began the nurse, going up to Anna and
        kissing her hands and shoulders. &ldquo;God has brought joy indeed to
        our boy on his birthday. You aren&rsquo;t changed one bit.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, nurse dear, I didn&rsquo;t know you were in the house,&rdquo;
        said Anna, rousing herself for a moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not living here, I&rsquo;m living with my daughter. I
        came for the birthday, Anna Arkadyevna, darling!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The nurse suddenly burst into tears, and began kissing her hand again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seryozha, with radiant eyes and smiles, holding his mother by one hand
        and his nurse by the other, pattered on the rug with his fat little bare
        feet. The tenderness shown by his beloved nurse to his mother threw him
        into an ecstasy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mother! She often comes to see me, and when she comes....&rdquo;
        he was beginning, but he stopped, noticing that the nurse was saying
        something in a whisper to his mother, and that in his mother&rsquo;s
        face there was a look of dread and something like shame, which was so
        strangely unbecoming to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        She went up to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My sweet!&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        She could not say <i>good-bye</i>, but the expression on her face said
        it, and he understood. &ldquo;Darling, darling Kootik!&rdquo; she used
        the name by which she had called him when he was little, &ldquo;you
        won&rsquo;t forget me? You....&rdquo; but she could not say more.
      </p>

      <p>
        How often afterwards she thought of words she might have said. But now
        she did not know how to say it, and could say nothing. But Seryozha knew
        all she wanted to say to him. He understood that she was unhappy and
        loved him. He understood even what the nurse had whispered. He had
        caught the words &ldquo;always at nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; and he knew
        that this was said of his father, and that his father and mother could
        not meet. That he understood, but one thing he could not
        understand&mdash;why there should be a look of dread and shame in her
        face?... She was not in fault, but she was afraid of him and ashamed of
        something. He would have liked to put a question that would have set at
        rest this doubt, but he did not dare; he saw that she was miserable, and
        he felt for her. Silently he pressed close to her and whispered,
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go yet. He won&rsquo;t come just yet.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The mother held him away from her to see what he was thinking, what to
        say to him, and in his frightened face she read not only that he was
        speaking of his father, but, as it were, asking her what he ought to
        think about his father.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Seryozha, my darling,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;love him;
        he&rsquo;s better and kinder than I am, and I have done him wrong. When
        you grow up you will judge.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one better than you!...&rdquo; he cried in
        despair through his tears, and, clutching her by the shoulders, he began
        squeezing her with all his force to him, his arms trembling with the
        strain.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My sweet, my little one!&rdquo; said Anna, and she cried as
        weakly and childishly as he.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment the door opened. Vassily Lukitch came in.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the other door there was the sound of steps, and the nurse in a
        scared whisper said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; and gave Anna her
        hat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seryozha sank onto the bed and sobbed, hiding his face in his hands.
        Anna removed his hands, once more kissed his wet face, and with rapid
        steps went to the door. Alexey Alexandrovitch walked in, meeting her.
        Seeing her, he stopped short and bowed his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although she had just said he was better and kinder than she, in the
        rapid glance she flung at him, taking in his whole figure in all its
        details, feelings of repulsion and hatred for him and jealousy over her
        son took possession of her. With a swift gesture she put down her veil,
        and, quickening her pace, almost ran out of the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        She had not time to undo, and so carried back with her, the parcel of
        toys she had chosen the day before in a toy shop with such love and
        sorrow.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 31</h3>

      <p>
        As intensely as Anna had longed to see her son, and long as she had been
        thinking of it and preparing herself for it, she had not in the least
        expected that seeing him would affect her so deeply. On getting back to
        her lonely rooms in the hotel she could not for a long while understand
        why she was there. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all over, and I am again
        alone,&rdquo; she said to herself, and without taking off her hat she
        sat down in a low chair by the hearth. Fixing her eyes on a bronze clock
        standing on a table between the windows, she tried to think.
      </p>

      <p>
        The French maid brought from abroad came in to suggest she should dress.
        She gazed at her wonderingly and said, &ldquo;Presently.&rdquo; A
        footman offered her coffee. &ldquo;Later on,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Italian nurse, after having taken the baby out in her best, came in
        with her, and brought her to Anna. The plump, well-fed little baby, on
        seeing her mother, as she always did, held out her fat little hands, and
        with a smile on her toothless mouth, began, like a fish with a float,
        bobbing her fingers up and down the starched folds of her embroidered
        skirt, making them rustle. It was impossible not to smile, not to kiss
        the baby, impossible not to hold out a finger for her to clutch, crowing
        and prancing all over; impossible not to offer her a lip which she
        sucked into her little mouth by way of a kiss. And all this Anna did,
        and took her in her arms and made her dance, and kissed her fresh little
        cheek and bare little elbows; but at the sight of this child it was
        plainer than ever to her that the feeling she had for her could not be
        called love in comparison with what she felt for Seryozha. Everything in
        this baby was charming, but for some reason all this did not go deep to
        her heart. On her first child, though the child of an unloved father,
        had been concentrated all the love that had never found satisfaction.
        Her baby girl had been born in the most painful circumstances and had
        not had a hundredth part of the care and thought which had been
        concentrated on her first child. Besides, in the little girl everything
        was still in the future, while Seryozha was by now almost a personality,
        and a personality dearly loved. In him there was a conflict of thought
        and feeling; he understood her, he loved her, he judged her, she
        thought, recalling his words and his eyes. And she was forever&mdash;not
        physically only but spiritually&mdash;divided from him, and it was
        impossible to set this right.
      </p>

      <p>
        She gave the baby back to the nurse, let her go, and opened the locket
        in which there was Seryozha&rsquo;s portrait when he was almost of the
        same age as the girl. She got up, and, taking off her hat, took up from
        a little table an album in which there were photographs of her son at
        different ages. She wanted to compare them, and began taking them out of
        the album. She took them all out except one, the latest and best
        photograph. In it he was in a white smock, sitting astride a chair, with
        frowning eyes and smiling lips. It was his best, most characteristic
        expression. With her little supple hands, her white, delicate fingers,
        that moved with a peculiar intensity today, she pulled at a corner of
        the photograph, but the photograph had caught somewhere, and she could
        not get it out. There was no paper-knife on the table, and so, pulling
        out the photograph that was next to her son&rsquo;s (it was a photograph
        of Vronsky taken at Rome in a round hat and with long hair), she used it
        to push out her son&rsquo;s photograph. &ldquo;Oh, here is he!&rdquo;
        she said, glancing at the portrait of Vronsky, and she suddenly recalled
        that he was the cause of her present misery. She had not once thought of
        him all the morning. But now, coming all at once upon that manly, noble
        face, so familiar and so dear to her, she felt a sudden rush of love for
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But where is he? How is it he leaves me alone in my
        misery?&rdquo; she thought all at once with a feeling of reproach,
        forgetting she had herself kept from him everything concerning her son.
        She sent to ask him to come to her immediately; with a throbbing heart
        she awaited him, rehearsing to herself the words in which she would tell
        him all, and the expressions of love with which he would console her.
        The messenger returned with the answer that he had a visitor with him,
        but that he would come immediately, and that he asked whether she would
        let him bring with him Prince Yashvin, who had just arrived in
        Petersburg. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not coming alone, and since dinner
        yesterday he has not seen me,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not
        coming so that I could tell him everything, but coming with
        Yashvin.&rdquo; And all at once a strange idea came to her: what if he
        had ceased to love her?
      </p>

      <p>
        And going over the events of the last few days, it seemed to her that
        she saw in everything a confirmation of this terrible idea. The fact
        that he had not dined at home yesterday, and the fact that he had
        insisted on their taking separate sets of rooms in Petersburg, and that
        even now he was not coming to her alone, as though he were trying to
        avoid meeting her face to face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But he ought to tell me so. I must know that it is so. If I knew
        it, then I know what I should do,&rdquo; she said to herself, utterly
        unable to picture to herself the position she would be in if she were
        convinced of his not caring for her. She thought he had ceased to love
        her, she felt close upon despair, and consequently she felt
        exceptionally alert. She rang for her maid and went to her
        dressing-room. As she dressed, she took more care over her appearance
        than she had done all those days, as though he might, if he had grown
        cold to her, fall in love with her again because she had dressed and
        arranged her hair in the way most becoming to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        She heard the bell ring before she was ready. When she went into the
        drawing-room it was not he, but Yashvin, who met her eyes. Vronsky was
        looking through the photographs of her son, which she had forgotten on
        the table, and he made no haste to look round at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We have met already,&rdquo; she said, putting her little hand
        into the huge hand of Yashvin, whose bashfulness was so queerly out of
        keeping with his immense frame and coarse face. &ldquo;We met last year
        at the races. Give them to me,&rdquo; she said, with a rapid movement
        snatching from Vronsky the photographs of her son, and glancing
        significantly at him with flashing eyes. &ldquo;Were the races good this
        year? Instead of them I saw the races in the Corso in Rome. But you
        don&rsquo;t care for life abroad,&rdquo; she said with a cordial smile.
        &ldquo;I know you and all your tastes, though I have seen so little of
        you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry for that, for my tastes are mostly
        bad,&rdquo; said Yashvin, gnawing at his left mustache.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having talked a little while, and noticing that Vronsky glanced at the
        clock, Yashvin asked her whether she would be staying much longer in
        Petersburg, and unbending his huge figure reached after his cap.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not long, I think,&rdquo; she said hesitatingly, glancing at
        Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So then we shan&rsquo;t meet again?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come and dine with me,&rdquo; said Anna resolutely, angry it
        seemed with herself for her embarrassment, but flushing as she always
        did when she defined her position before a fresh person. &ldquo;The
        dinner here is not good, but at least you will see him. There is no one
        of his old friends in the regiment Alexey cares for as he does for
        you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; said Yashvin with a smile, from which Vronsky
        could see that he liked Anna very much.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yashvin said good-bye and went away; Vronsky stayed behind.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you going too?&rdquo; she said to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m late already,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Run along!
        I&rsquo;ll catch you up in a moment,&rdquo; he called to Yashvin.
      </p>

      <p>
        She took him by the hand, and without taking her eyes off him, gazed at
        him while she ransacked her mind for the words to say that would keep
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Wait a minute, there&rsquo;s something I want to say to
        you,&rdquo; and taking his broad hand she pressed it on her neck.
        &ldquo;Oh, was it right my asking him to dinner?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You did quite right,&rdquo; he said with a serene smile that
        showed his even teeth, and he kissed her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey, you have not changed to me?&rdquo; she said, pressing his
        hand in both of hers. &ldquo;Alexey, I am miserable here. When are we
        going away?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Soon, soon. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how disagreeable our way
        of living here is to me too,&rdquo; he said, and he drew away his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, go, go!&rdquo; she said in a tone of offense, and she
        walked quickly away from him.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 32</h3>

      <p>
        When Vronsky returned home, Anna was not yet home. Soon after he had
        left, some lady, so they told him, had come to see her, and she had gone
        out with her. That she had gone out without leaving word where she was
        going, that she had not yet come back, and that all the morning she had
        been going about somewhere without a word to him&mdash;all this,
        together with the strange look of excitement in her face in the morning,
        and the recollection of the hostile tone with which she had before
        Yashvin almost snatched her son&rsquo;s photographs out of his hands,
        made him serious. He decided he absolutely must speak openly with her.
        And he waited for her in her drawing-room. But Anna did not return
        alone, but brought with her her old unmarried aunt, Princess Oblonskaya.
        This was the lady who had come in the morning, and with whom Anna had
        gone out shopping. Anna appeared not to notice Vronsky&rsquo;s worried
        and inquiring expression, and began a lively account of her
        morning&rsquo;s shopping. He saw that there was something working within
        her; in her flashing eyes, when they rested for a moment on him, there
        was an intense concentration, and in her words and movements there was
        that nervous rapidity and grace which, during the early period of their
        intimacy, had so fascinated him, but which now so disturbed and alarmed
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dinner was laid for four. All were gathered together and about to go
        into the little dining-room when Tushkevitch made his appearance with a
        message from Princess Betsy. Princess Betsy begged her to excuse her not
        having come to say good-bye; she had been indisposed, but begged Anna to
        come to her between half-past six and nine o&rsquo;clock. Vronsky
        glanced at Anna at the precise limit of time, so suggestive of steps
        having been taken that she should meet no one; but Anna appeared not to
        notice it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very sorry that I can&rsquo;t come just between half-past six and
        nine,&rdquo; she said with a faint smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The princess will be very sorry.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And so am I.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going, no doubt, to hear Patti?&rdquo; said
        Tushkevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Patti? You suggest the idea to me. I would go if it were possible
        to get a box.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can get one,&rdquo; Tushkevitch offered his services.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I should be very, very grateful to you,&rdquo; said Anna.
        &ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you dine with us?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky gave a hardly perceptible shrug. He was at a complete loss to
        understand what Anna was about. What had she brought the old Princess
        Oblonskaya home for, what had she made Tushkevitch stay to dinner for,
        and, most amazing of all, why was she sending him for a box? Could she
        possibly think in her position of going to Patti&rsquo;s benefit, where
        all the circle of her acquaintances would be? He looked at her with
        serious eyes, but she responded with that defiant, half-mirthful,
        half-desperate look, the meaning of which he could not comprehend. At
        dinner Anna was in aggressively high spirits&mdash;she almost flirted
        both with Tushkevitch and with Yashvin. When they got up from dinner and
        Tushkevitch had gone to get a box at the opera, Yashvin went to smoke,
        and Vronsky went down with him to his own rooms. After sitting there for
        some time he ran upstairs. Anna was already dressed in a low-necked gown
        of light silk and velvet that she had had made in Paris, and with costly
        white lace on her head, framing her face, and particularly becoming,
        showing up her dazzling beauty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you really going to the theater?&rdquo; he said, trying not
        to look at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why do you ask with such alarm?&rdquo; she said, wounded again at
        his not looking at her. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I go?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She appeared not to understand the motive of his words.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, of course, there&rsquo;s no reason whatever,&rdquo; he said,
        frowning.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I say,&rdquo; she said, willfully refusing
        to see the irony of his tone, and quietly turning back her long,
        perfumed glove.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna, for God&rsquo;s sake! what is the matter with you?&rdquo;
        he said, appealing to her exactly as once her husband had done.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you are asking.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You know that it&rsquo;s out of the question to go.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so? I&rsquo;m not going alone. Princess Varvara has gone to
        dress, she is going with me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity and despair.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But do you mean to say you don&rsquo;t know?...&rdquo; he began.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t care to know!&rdquo; she almost shrieked.
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to. Do I regret what I have done? No, no, no!
        If it were all to do again from the beginning, it would be the same. For
        us, for you and for me, there is only one thing that matters, whether we
        love each other. Other people we need not consider. Why are we living
        here apart and not seeing each other? Why can&rsquo;t I go? I love you,
        and I don&rsquo;t care for anything,&rdquo; she said in Russian,
        glancing at him with a peculiar gleam in her eyes that he could not
        understand. &ldquo;If you have not changed to me, why don&rsquo;t you
        look at me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked at her. He saw all the beauty of her face and full dress,
        always so becoming to her. But now her beauty and elegance were just
        what irritated him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My feeling cannot change, you know, but I beg you, I entreat
        you,&rdquo; he said again in French, with a note of tender supplication
        in his voice, but with coldness in his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        She did not hear his words, but she saw the coldness of his eyes, and
        answered with irritation:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And I beg you to explain why I should not go.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Because it might cause you....&rdquo; he hesitated.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. Yashvin
        <i>n&rsquo;est pas compromettant</i>, and Princess Varvara is no worse
        than others. Oh, here she is!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 33</h3>

      <p>
        Vronsky for the first time experienced a feeling of anger against Anna,
        almost a hatred for her willfully refusing to understand her own
        position. This feeling was aggravated by his being unable to tell her
        plainly the cause of his anger. If he had told her directly what he was
        thinking, he would have said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In that dress, with a princess only too well known to everyone,
        to show yourself at the theater is equivalent not merely to
        acknowledging your position as a fallen woman, but is flinging down a
        challenge to society, that is to say, cutting yourself off from it
        forever.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He could not say that to her. &ldquo;But how can she fail to see it, and
        what is going on in her?&rdquo; he said to himself. He felt at the same
        time that his respect for her was diminished while his sense of her
        beauty was intensified.
      </p>

      <p>
        He went back scowling to his rooms, and sitting down beside Yashvin,
        who, with his long legs stretched out on a chair, was drinking brandy
        and seltzer water, he ordered a glass of the same for himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You were talking of Lankovsky&rsquo;s Powerful. That&rsquo;s a
        fine horse, and I would advise you to buy him,&rdquo; said Yashvin,
        glancing at his comrade&rsquo;s gloomy face. &ldquo;His hind-quarters
        aren&rsquo;t quite first-rate, but the legs and head&mdash;one
        couldn&rsquo;t wish for anything better.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think I will take him,&rdquo; answered Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their conversation about horses interested him, but he did not for an
        instant forget Anna, and could not help listening to the sound of steps
        in the corridor and looking at the clock on the chimney piece.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna Arkadyevna gave orders to announce that she has gone to the
        theater.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Yashvin, tipping another glass of brandy into the bubbling water, drank
        it and got up, buttoning his coat.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; he said, faintly smiling under his
        mustache, and showing by this smile that he knew the cause of
        Vronsky&rsquo;s gloominess, and did not attach any significance to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going,&rdquo; Vronsky answered gloomily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I must, I promised to. Good-bye, then. If you do, come to
        the stalls; you can take Kruzin&rsquo;s stall,&rdquo; added Yashvin as
        he went out.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A wife is a care, but it&rsquo;s worse when she&rsquo;s not a
        wife,&rdquo; thought Yashvin, as he walked out of the hotel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky, left alone, got up from his chair and began pacing up and down
        the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s today? The fourth night.... Yegor and his wife
        are there, and my mother, most likely. Of course all Petersburg&rsquo;s
        there. Now she&rsquo;s gone in, taken off her cloak and come into the
        light. Tushkevitch, Yashvin, Princess Varvara,&rdquo; he pictured them
        to himself.... &ldquo;What about me? Either that I&rsquo;m frightened or
        have given up to Tushkevitch the right to protect her? From every point
        of view&mdash;stupid, stupid!... And why is she putting me in such a
        position?&rdquo; he said with a gesture of despair.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that gesture he knocked against the table, on which there was
        standing the seltzer water and the decanter of brandy, and almost upset
        it. He tried to catch it, let it slip, and angrily kicked the table over
        and rang.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you care to be in my service,&rdquo; he said to the valet who
        came in, &ldquo;you had better remember your duties. This
        shouldn&rsquo;t be here. You ought to have cleared away.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The valet, conscious of his own innocence, would have defended himself,
        but glancing at his master, he saw from his face that the only thing to
        do was to be silent, and hurriedly threading his way in and out, dropped
        down on the carpet and began gathering up the whole and broken glasses
        and bottles.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not your duty; send the waiter to clear away, and
        get my dress coat out.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky went into the theater at half-past eight. The performance was in
        full swing. The little old box-keeper, recognizing Vronsky as he helped
        him off with his fur coat, called him &ldquo;Your Excellency,&rdquo; and
        suggested he should not take a number but should simply call Fyodor. In
        the brightly lighted corridor there was no one but the box-opener and
        two attendants with fur cloaks on their arms listening at the doors.
        Through the closed doors came the sounds of the discreet
        <i>staccato</i> accompaniment of the orchestra, and a single female
        voice rendering distinctly a musical phrase. The door opened to let the
        box-opener slip through, and the phrase drawing to the end reached
        Vronsky&rsquo;s hearing clearly. But the doors were closed again at
        once, and Vronsky did not hear the end of the phrase and the cadence of
        the accompaniment, though he knew from the thunder of applause that it
        was over. When he entered the hall, brilliantly lighted with chandeliers
        and gas jets, the noise was still going on. On the stage the singer,
        bowing and smiling, with bare shoulders flashing with diamonds, was,
        with the help of the tenor who had given her his arm, gathering up the
        bouquets that were flying awkwardly over the footlights. Then she went
        up to a gentleman with glossy pomaded hair parted down the center, who
        was stretching across the footlights holding out something to her, and
        all the public in the stalls as well as in the boxes was in excitement,
        craning forward, shouting and clapping. The conductor in his high chair
        assisted in passing the offering, and straightened his white tie.
        Vronsky walked into the middle of the stalls, and, standing still, began
        looking about him. That day less than ever was his attention turned upon
        the familiar, habitual surroundings, the stage, the noise, all the
        familiar, uninteresting, particolored herd of spectators in the packed
        theater.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were, as always, the same ladies of some sort with officers of
        some sort in the back of the boxes; the same gaily dressed
        women&mdash;God knows who&mdash;and uniforms and black coats; the same
        dirty crowd in the upper gallery; and among the crowd, in the boxes and
        in the front rows, were some forty of the <i>real</i> people. And to
        those oases Vronsky at once directed his attention, and with them he
        entered at once into relation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The act was over when he went in, and so he did not go straight to his
        brother&rsquo;s box, but going up to the first row of stalls stopped at
        the footlights with Serpuhovskoy, who, standing with one knee raised and
        his heel on the footlights, caught sight of him in the distance and
        beckoned to him, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky had not yet seen Anna. He purposely avoided looking in her
        direction. But he knew by the direction of people&rsquo;s eyes where she
        was. He looked round discreetly, but he was not seeking her; expecting
        the worst, his eyes sought for Alexey Alexandrovitch. To his relief
        Alexey Alexandrovitch was not in the theater that evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How little of the military man there is left in you!&rdquo;
        Serpuhovskoy was saying to him. &ldquo;A diplomat, an artist, something
        of that sort, one would say.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it was like going back home when I put on a black
        coat,&rdquo; answered Vronsky, smiling and slowly taking out his
        opera-glass.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll own I envy you there. When I come back from
        abroad and put on this,&rdquo; he touched his epaulets, &ldquo;I regret
        my freedom.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Serpuhovskoy had long given up all hope of Vronsky&rsquo;s career, but
        he liked him as before, and was now particularly cordial to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a pity you were not in time for the first act!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky, listening with one ear, moved his opera-glass from the stalls
        and scanned the boxes. Near a lady in a turban and a bald old man, who
        seemed to wave angrily in the moving opera-glass, Vronsky suddenly
        caught sight of Anna&rsquo;s head, proud, strikingly beautiful, and
        smiling in the frame of lace. She was in the fifth box, twenty paces
        from him. She was sitting in front, and slightly turning, was saying
        something to Yashvin. The setting of her head on her handsome, broad
        shoulders, and the restrained excitement and brilliance of her eyes and
        her whole face reminded him of her just as he had seen her at the ball
        in Moscow. But he felt utterly different towards her beauty now. In his
        feeling for her now there was no element of mystery, and so her beauty,
        though it attracted him even more intensely than before, gave him now a
        sense of injury. She was not looking in his direction, but Vronsky felt
        that she had seen him already.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Vronsky turned the opera-glass again in that direction, he noticed
        that Princess Varvara was particularly red, and kept laughing
        unnaturally and looking round at the next box. Anna, folding her fan and
        tapping it on the red velvet, was gazing away and did not see, and
        obviously did not wish to see, what was taking place in the next box.
        Yashvin&rsquo;s face wore the expression which was common when he was
        losing at cards. Scowling, he sucked the left end of his mustache
        further and further into his mouth, and cast sidelong glances at the
        next box.
      </p>

      <p>
        In that box on the left were the Kartasovs. Vronsky knew them, and knew
        that Anna was acquainted with them. Madame Kartasova, a thin little
        woman, was standing up in her box, and, her back turned upon Anna, she
        was putting on a mantle that her husband was holding for her. Her face
        was pale and angry, and she was talking excitedly. Kartasov, a fat, bald
        man, was continually looking round at Anna, while he attempted to soothe
        his wife. When the wife had gone out, the husband lingered a long while,
        and tried to catch Anna&rsquo;s eye, obviously anxious to bow to her.
        But Anna, with unmistakable intention, avoided noticing him, and talked
        to Yashvin, whose cropped head was bent down to her. Kartasov went out
        without making his salutation, and the box was left empty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky could not understand exactly what had passed between the
        Kartasovs and Anna, but he saw that something humiliating for Anna had
        happened. He knew this both from what he had seen, and most of all from
        the face of Anna, who, he could see, was taxing every nerve to carry
        through the part she had taken up. And in maintaining this attitude of
        external composure she was completely successful. Anyone who did not
        know her and her circle, who had not heard all the utterances of the
        women expressive of commiseration, indignation, and amazement, that she
        should show herself in society, and show herself so conspicuously with
        her lace and her beauty, would have admired the serenity and loveliness
        of this woman without a suspicion that she was undergoing the sensations
        of a man in the stocks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Knowing that something had happened, but not knowing precisely what,
        Vronsky felt a thrill of agonizing anxiety, and hoping to find out
        something, he went towards his brother&rsquo;s box. Purposely choosing
        the way round furthest from Anna&rsquo;s box, he jostled as he came out
        against the colonel of his old regiment talking to two acquaintances.
        Vronsky heard the name of Madame Karenina, and noticed how the colonel
        hastened to address Vronsky loudly by name, with a meaning glance at his
        companions.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, Vronsky! When are you coming to the regiment? We can&rsquo;t
        let you off without a supper. You&rsquo;re one of the old set,&rdquo;
        said the colonel of his regiment.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop, awfully sorry, another time,&rdquo; said
        Vronsky, and he ran upstairs towards his brother&rsquo;s box.
      </p>

      <p>
        The old countess, Vronsky&rsquo;s mother, with her steel-gray curls, was
        in his brother&rsquo;s box. Varya with the young Princess Sorokina met
        him in the corridor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Leaving the Princess Sorokina with her mother, Varya held out her hand
        to her brother-in-law, and began immediately to speak of what interested
        him. She was more excited than he had ever seen her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s mean and hateful, and Madame Kartasova had no
        right to do it. Madame Karenina....&rdquo; she began.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what is it? I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What? you&rsquo;ve not heard?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You know I should be the last person to hear of it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a more spiteful creature than that Madame
        Kartasova!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what did she do?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My husband told me.... She has insulted Madame Karenina. Her
        husband began talking to her across the box, and Madame Kartasova made a
        scene. She said something aloud, he says, something insulting, and went
        away.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Count, your maman is asking for you,&rdquo; said the young
        Princess Sorokina, peeping out of the door of the box.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been expecting you all the while,&rdquo; said his
        mother, smiling sarcastically. &ldquo;You were nowhere to be
        seen.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Her son saw that she could not suppress a smile of delight.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Good evening, maman. I have come to you,&rdquo; he said coldly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you going to
        <i>faire la cour à Madame Karenina?</i>&rdquo; she went on, when
        Princess Sorokina had moved away. &ldquo;<i
          >Elle fait sensation. On oublie la Patti pour elle</i
        >.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Maman, I have asked you not to say anything to me of that,&rdquo;
        he answered, scowling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only saying what everyone&rsquo;s saying.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky made no reply, and saying a few words to Princess Sorokina, he
        went away. At the door he met his brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, Alexey!&rdquo; said his brother. &ldquo;How disgusting! Idiot
        of a woman, nothing else.... I wanted to go straight to her. Let&rsquo;s
        go together.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky did not hear him. With rapid steps he went downstairs; he felt
        that he must do something, but he did not know what. Anger with her for
        having put herself and him in such a false position, together with pity
        for her suffering, filled his heart. He went down, and made straight for
        Anna&rsquo;s box. At her box stood Stremov, talking to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There are no more tenors. <i>Le moule en est brisé!</i>&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky bowed to her and stopped to greet Stremov.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You came in late, I think, and have missed the best song,&rdquo;
        Anna said to Vronsky, glancing ironically, he thought, at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am a poor judge of music,&rdquo; he said, looking sternly at
        her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Like Prince Yashvin,&rdquo; she said smiling, &ldquo;who
        considers that Patti sings too loud.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, her little hand in its long glove
        taking the playbill Vronsky picked up, and suddenly at that instant her
        lovely face quivered. She got up and went into the interior of the box.
      </p>

      <p>
        Noticing in the next act that her box was empty, Vronsky, rousing
        indignant &ldquo;hushes&rdquo; in the silent audience, went out in the
        middle of a solo and drove home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna was already at home. When Vronsky went up to her, she was in the
        same dress as she had worn at the theater. She was sitting in the first
        armchair against the wall, looking straight before her. She looked at
        him, and at once resumed her former position.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You, you are to blame for everything!&rdquo; she cried, with
        tears of despair and hatred in her voice, getting up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I begged, I implored you not to go, I knew it would be
        unpleasant....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Unpleasant!&rdquo; she cried&mdash;&ldquo;hideous! As long as I
        live I shall never forget it. She said it was a disgrace to sit beside
        me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A silly woman&rsquo;s chatter,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;but why
        risk it, why provoke?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I hate your calm. You ought not to have brought me to this. If
        you had loved me....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna! How does the question of my love come in?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, if you loved me, as I love, if you were tortured as I
        am!...&rdquo; she said, looking at him with an expression of terror.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was sorry for her, and angry notwithstanding. He assured her of his
        love because he saw that this was the only means of soothing her, and he
        did not reproach her in words, but in his heart he reproached her.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the asseverations of his love, which seemed to him so vulgar that he
        was ashamed to utter them, she drank in eagerly, and gradually became
        calmer. The next day, completely reconciled, they left for the country.

      <h2>PART SIX</h2>

      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna spent the summer with her children at Pokrovskoe, at
        her sister Kitty Levin&rsquo;s. The house on her own estate was quite in
        ruins, and Levin and his wife had persuaded her to spend the summer with
        them. Stepan Arkadyevitch greatly approved of the arrangement. He said
        he was very sorry his official duties prevented him from spending the
        summer in the country with his family, which would have been the
        greatest happiness for him; and remaining in Moscow, he came down to the
        country from time to time for a day or two. Besides the Oblonskys, with
        all their children and their governess, the old princess too came to
        stay that summer with the Levins, as she considered it her duty to watch
        over her inexperienced daughter in her <i>interesting condition</i>.
        Moreover, Varenka, Kitty&rsquo;s friend abroad, kept her promise to come
        to Kitty when she was married, and stayed with her friend. All of these
        were friends or relations of Levin&rsquo;s wife. And though he liked
        them all, he rather regretted his own Levin world and ways, which was
        smothered by this influx of the &ldquo;Shtcherbatsky element,&rdquo; as
        he called it to himself. Of his own relations there stayed with him only
        Sergey Ivanovitch, but he too was a man of the Koznishev and not the
        Levin stamp, so that the Levin spirit was utterly obliterated.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Levins&rsquo; house, so long deserted, there were now so many
        people that almost all the rooms were occupied, and almost every day it
        happened that the old princess, sitting down to table, counted them all
        over, and put the thirteenth grandson or granddaughter at a separate
        table. And Kitty, with her careful housekeeping, had no little trouble
        to get all the chickens, turkeys, and geese, of which so many were
        needed to satisfy the summer appetites of the visitors and children.
      </p>

      <p>
        The whole family were sitting at dinner. Dolly&rsquo;s children, with
        their governess and Varenka, were making plans for going to look for
        mushrooms. Sergey Ivanovitch, who was looked up to by all the party for
        his intellect and learning, with a respect that almost amounted to awe,
        surprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Take me with you. I am very fond of picking mushrooms,&rdquo; he
        said, looking at Varenka; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a very nice
        occupation.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, we shall be delighted,&rdquo; answered Varenka, coloring a
        little. Kitty exchanged meaningful glances with Dolly. The proposal of
        the learned and intellectual Sergey Ivanovitch to go looking for
        mushrooms with Varenka confirmed certain theories of Kitty&rsquo;s with
        which her mind had been very busy of late. She made haste to address
        some remark to her mother, so that her look should not be noticed. After
        dinner Sergey Ivanovitch sat with his cup of coffee at the drawing-room
        window, and while he took part in a conversation he had begun with his
        brother, he watched the door through which the children would start on
        the mushroom-picking expedition. Levin was sitting in the window near
        his brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty stood beside her husband, evidently awaiting the end of a
        conversation that had no interest for her, in order to tell him
        something.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You have changed in many respects since your marriage, and for
        the better,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling to Kitty, and
        obviously little interested in the conversation, &ldquo;but you have
        remained true to your passion for defending the most paradoxical
        theories.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Katya, it&rsquo;s not good for you to stand,&rdquo; her husband
        said to her, putting a chair for her and looking significantly at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, and there&rsquo;s no time either,&rdquo; added Sergey
        Ivanovitch, seeing the children running out.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the head of them all Tanya galloped sideways, in her tightly-drawn
        stockings, and waving a basket and Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s hat, she
        ran straight up to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Boldly running up to Sergey Ivanovitch with shining eyes, so like her
        father&rsquo;s fine eyes, she handed him his hat and made as though she
        would put it on for him, softening her freedom by a shy and friendly
        smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Varenka&rsquo;s waiting,&rdquo; she said, carefully putting his
        hat on, seeing from Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s smile that she might do
        so.
      </p>

      <p>
        Varenka was standing at the door, dressed in a yellow print gown, with a
        white kerchief on her head.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming, I&rsquo;m coming, Varvara Andreevna,&rdquo;
        said Sergey Ivanovitch, finishing his cup of coffee, and putting into
        their separate pockets his handkerchief and cigar-case.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And how sweet my Varenka is! eh?&rdquo; said Kitty to her
        husband, as soon as Sergey Ivanovitch rose. She spoke so that Sergey
        Ivanovitch could hear, and it was clear that she meant him to do so.
        &ldquo;And how good-looking she is&mdash;such a refined beauty!
        Varenka!&rdquo; Kitty shouted. &ldquo;Shall you be in the mill copse?
        We&rsquo;ll come out to you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You certainly forget your condition, Kitty,&rdquo; said the old
        princess, hurriedly coming out at the door. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t
        shout like that.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Varenka, hearing Kitty&rsquo;s voice and her mother&rsquo;s reprimand,
        went with light, rapid steps up to Kitty. The rapidity of her movement,
        her flushed and eager face, everything betrayed that something out of
        the common was going on in her. Kitty knew what this was, and had been
        watching her intently. She called Varenka at that moment merely in order
        mentally to give her a blessing for the important event which, as Kitty
        fancied, was bound to come to pass that day after dinner in the wood.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Varenka, I should be very happy if a certain something were to
        happen,&rdquo; she whispered as she kissed her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And are you coming with us?&rdquo; Varenka said to Levin in
        confusion, pretending not to have heard what had been said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am coming, but only as far as the threshing-floor, and there I
        shall stop.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, what do you want there?&rdquo; said Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I must go to have a look at the new wagons, and to check the
        invoice,&rdquo; said Levin; &ldquo;and where will you be?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;On the terrace.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

      <p>
        On the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party. They always
        liked sitting there after dinner, and that day they had work to do there
        too. Besides the sewing and knitting of baby clothes, with which all of
        them were busy, that afternoon jam was being made on the terrace by a
        method new to Agafea Mihalovna, without the addition of water. Kitty had
        introduced this new method, which had been in use in her home. Agafea
        Mihalovna, to whom the task of jam-making had always been intrusted,
        considering that what had been done in the Levin household could not be
        amiss, had nevertheless put water with the strawberries, maintaining
        that the jam could not be made without it. She had been caught in the
        act, and was now making jam before everyone, and it was to be proved to
        her conclusively that jam could be very well made without water.
      </p>

      <p>
        Agafea Mihalovna, her face heated and angry, her hair untidy, and her
        thin arms bare to the elbows, was turning the preserving-pan over the
        charcoal stove, looking darkly at the raspberries and devoutly hoping
        they would stick and not cook properly. The princess, conscious that
        Agafea Mihalovna&rsquo;s wrath must be chiefly directed against her, as
        the person responsible for the raspberry jam-making, tried to appear to
        be absorbed in other things and not interested in the jam, talked of
        other matters, but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the stove.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I always buy my maids&rsquo; dresses myself, of some cheap
        material,&rdquo; the princess said, continuing the previous
        conversation. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it time to skim it, my dear?&rdquo; she
        added, addressing Agafea Mihalovna. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not the
        slightest need for you to do it, and it&rsquo;s hot for you,&rdquo; she
        said, stopping Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said Dolly, and getting up, she
        carefully passed the spoon over the frothing sugar, and from time to
        time shook off the clinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate
        that was covered with yellow-red scum and blood-colored syrup.
        &ldquo;How they&rsquo;ll enjoy this at tea-time!&rdquo; she thought of
        her children, remembering how she herself as a child had wondered how it
        was the grown-up people did not eat what was best of all&mdash;the scum
        of the jam.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Stiva says it&rsquo;s much better to give money.&rdquo; Dolly
        took up meanwhile the weighty subject under discussion, what presents
        should be made to servants. &ldquo;But....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Money&rsquo;s out of the question!&rdquo; the princess and Kitty
        exclaimed with one voice. &ldquo;They appreciate a present....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, last year, for instance, I bought our Matrona Semyenovna,
        not a poplin, but something of that sort,&rdquo; said the princess.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I remember she was wearing it on your nameday.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A charming pattern&mdash;so simple and refined,&mdash;I should
        have liked it myself, if she hadn&rsquo;t had it. Something like
        Varenka&rsquo;s. So pretty and inexpensive.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, now I think it&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; said Dolly, dropping
        the syrup from the spoon.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;When it sets as it drops, it&rsquo;s ready. Cook it a little
        longer, Agafea Mihalovna.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The flies!&rdquo; said Agafea Mihalovna angrily.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be just the same,&rdquo; she added.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! how sweet it is! don&rsquo;t frighten it!&rdquo; Kitty said
        suddenly, looking at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was
        pecking at the center of a raspberry.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but you keep a little further from the stove,&rdquo; said
        her mother.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>À propos de Varenka</i>,&rdquo; said Kitty, speaking in
        French, as they had been doing all the while, so that Agafea Mihalovna
        should not understand them, &ldquo;you know, mamma, I somehow expect
        things to be settled today. You know what I mean. How splendid it would
        be!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what a famous matchmaker she is!&rdquo; said Dolly.
        &ldquo;How carefully and cleverly she throws them together!...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; tell me, mamma, what do you think?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, what is one to think? He&rdquo; (<i>he</i> meant Sergey
        Ivanovitch) &ldquo;might at any time have been a match for anyone in
        Russia; now, of course, he&rsquo;s not quite a young man, still I know
        ever so many girls would be glad to marry him even now.... She&rsquo;s a
        very nice girl, but he might....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, mamma, do understand why, for him and for her too,
        nothing better could be imagined. In the first place, she&rsquo;s
        charming!&rdquo; said Kitty, crooking one of her fingers.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He thinks her very attractive, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo;
        assented Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then he occupies such a position in society that he has no need
        to look for either fortune or position in his wife. All he needs is a
        good, sweet wife&mdash;a restful one.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, with her he would certainly be restful,&rdquo; Dolly
        assented.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thirdly, that she should love him. And so it is ... that is, it
        would be so splendid!... I look forward to seeing them coming out of the
        forest&mdash;and everything settled. I shall see at once by their eyes.
        I should be so delighted! What do you think, Dolly?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t excite yourself. It&rsquo;s not at all the thing
        for you to be excited,&rdquo; said her mother.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not excited, mamma. I fancy he will make her an
        offer today.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s so strange, how and when a man makes an
        offer!... There is a sort of barrier, and all at once it&rsquo;s broken
        down,&rdquo; said Dolly, smiling pensively and recalling her past with
        Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mamma, how did papa make you an offer?&rdquo; Kitty asked
        suddenly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There was nothing out of the way, it was very simple,&rdquo;
        answered the princess, but her face beamed all over at the recollection.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, but how was it? You loved him, anyway, before you were
        allowed to speak?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her mother
        on equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a
        woman&rsquo;s life.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course I did; he had come to stay with us in the
        country.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But how was it settled between you, mamma?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new?
        It&rsquo;s always just the same: it was settled by the eyes, by
        smiles....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How nicely you said that, mamma! It&rsquo;s just by the eyes, by
        smiles that it&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; Dolly assented.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what words did he say?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What did Kostya say to you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He wrote it in chalk. It was wonderful.... How long ago it
        seems!&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the three women all fell to musing on the same thing. Kitty was the
        first to break the silence. She remembered all that last winter before
        her marriage, and her passion for Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing ... that old love affair of
        Varenka&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said, a natural chain of ideas bringing her
        to this point. &ldquo;I should have liked to say something to Sergey
        Ivanovitch, to prepare him. They&rsquo;re all&mdash;all men, I
        mean,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;awfully jealous over our past.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not all,&rdquo; said Dolly. &ldquo;You judge by your own husband.
        It makes him miserable even now to remember Vronsky. Eh? that&rsquo;s
        true, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Kitty answered, a pensive smile in her eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the mother put in in
        defense of her motherly care of her daughter, &ldquo;what there was in
        your past that could worry him? That Vronsky paid you
        attentions&mdash;that happens to every girl.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, but we didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; Kitty said,
        flushing a little.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, let me speak,&rdquo; her mother went on, &ldquo;why, you
        yourself would not let me have a talk to Vronsky. Don&rsquo;t you
        remember?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, mamma!&rdquo; said Kitty, with an expression of suffering.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no keeping you young people in check nowadays....
        Your friendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable. I should
        myself have called upon him to explain himself. But, my darling,
        it&rsquo;s not right for you to be agitated. Please remember that, and
        calm yourself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly calm, maman.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How happy it was for Kitty that Anna came then,&rdquo; said
        Dolly, &ldquo;and how unhappy for her. It turned out quite the
        opposite,&rdquo; she said, struck by her own ideas. &ldquo;Then Anna was
        so happy, and Kitty thought herself unhappy. Now it is just the
        opposite. I often think of her.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A nice person to think about! Horrid, repulsive woman&mdash;no
        heart,&rdquo; said her mother, who could not forget that Kitty had
        married not Vronsky, but Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you want to talk of it for?&rdquo; Kitty said with
        annoyance. &ldquo;I never think about it, and I don&rsquo;t want to
        think of it.... And I don&rsquo;t want to think of it,&rdquo; she said,
        catching the sound of her husband&rsquo;s well-known step on the steps
        of the terrace.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you don&rsquo;t want to think about?&rdquo;
        inquired Levin, coming onto the terrace.
      </p>

      <p>
        But no one answered him, and he did not repeat the question.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;ve broken in on your feminine
        parliament,&rdquo; he said, looking round on everyone discontentedly,
        and perceiving that they had been talking of something which they would
        not talk about before him.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a second he felt that he was sharing the feeling of Agafea
        Mihalovna, vexation at their making jam without water, and altogether at
        the outside Shtcherbatsky element. He smiled, however, and went up to
        Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, how are you?&rdquo; he asked her, looking at her with the
        expression with which everyone looked at her now.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; said Kitty, smiling, &ldquo;and how have
        things gone with you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The wagons held three times as much as the old carts did. Well,
        are we going for the children? I&rsquo;ve ordered the horses to be put
        in.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What! you want to take Kitty in the wagonette?&rdquo; her mother
        said reproachfully.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, at a walking pace, princess.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin never called the princess &ldquo;maman&rdquo; as men often do call
        their mothers-in-law, and the princess disliked his not doing so. But
        though he liked and respected the princess, Levin could not call her so
        without a sense of profaning his feeling for his dead mother.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come with us, maman,&rdquo; said Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to see such imprudence.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll walk then, I&rsquo;m so well.&rdquo; Kitty got
        up and went to her husband and took his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You may be well, but everything in moderation,&rdquo; said the
        princess.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, Agafea Mihalovna, is the jam done?&rdquo; said Levin,
        smiling to Agafea Mihalovna, and trying to cheer her up. &ldquo;Is it
        all right in the new way?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s all right. For our notions it&rsquo;s boiled
        too long.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all the better, Agafea Mihalovna, it won&rsquo;t
        mildew, even though our ice has begun to thaw already, so that
        we&rsquo;ve no cool cellar to store it,&rdquo; said Kitty, at once
        divining her husband&rsquo;s motive, and addressing the old housekeeper
        with the same feeling; &ldquo;but your pickle&rsquo;s so good, that
        mamma says she never tasted any like it,&rdquo; she added, smiling, and
        putting her kerchief straight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Agafea Mihalovna looked angrily at Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t try to console me, mistress. I need only to
        look at you with him, and I feel happy,&rdquo; she said, and something
        in the rough familiarity of that <i>with him</i> touched Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come along with us to look for mushrooms, you will show us the
        best places.&rdquo; Agafea Mihalovna smiled and shook her head, as
        though to say: &ldquo;I should like to be angry with you too, but I
        can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do it, please, by my receipt,&rdquo; said the princess;
        &ldquo;put some paper over the jam, and moisten it with a little rum,
        and without even ice, it will never go mildewy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 3</h3>

      <p>
        Kitty was particularly glad of a chance of being alone with her husband,
        for she had noticed the shade of mortification that had passed over his
        face&mdash;always so quick to reflect every feeling&mdash;at the moment
        when he had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of,
        and had got no answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they had set off on foot ahead of the others, and had come out of
        sight of the house onto the beaten dusty road, marked with rusty wheels
        and sprinkled with grains of corn, she clung faster to his arm and
        pressed it closer to her. He had quite forgotten the momentary
        unpleasant impression, and alone with her he felt, now that the thought
        of her approaching motherhood was never for a moment absent from his
        mind, a new and delicious bliss, quite pure from all alloy of sense, in
        the being near to the woman he loved. There was no need of speech, yet
        he longed to hear the sound of her voice, which like her eyes had
        changed since she had been with child. In her voice, as in her eyes,
        there was that softness and gravity which is found in people continually
        concentrated on some cherished pursuit.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not tired? Lean more on me,&rdquo; said he.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m so glad of a chance of being alone with you, and I
        must own, though I&rsquo;m happy with them, I do regret our winter
        evenings alone.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That was good, but this is even better. Both are better,&rdquo;
        he said, squeezing her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know what we were talking about when you came in?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;About jam?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, about jam too; but afterwards, about how men make
        offers.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Levin, listening more to the sound of her voice
        than to the words she was saying, and all the while paying attention to
        the road, which passed now through the forest, and avoiding places where
        she might make a false step.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And about Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka. You&rsquo;ve noticed?...
        I&rsquo;m very anxious for it,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;What do you
        think about it?&rdquo; And she peeped into his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; Levin answered, smiling.
        &ldquo;Sergey seems very strange to me in that way. I told you, you
        know....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that he was in love with that girl who died....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That was when I was a child; I know about it from hearsay and
        tradition. I remember him then. He was wonderfully sweet. But I&rsquo;ve
        watched him since with women; he is friendly, some of them he likes, but
        one feels that to him they&rsquo;re simply people, not women.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but now with Varenka ... I fancy there&rsquo;s
        something....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps there is.... But one has to know him.... He&rsquo;s a
        peculiar, wonderful person. He lives a spiritual life only. He&rsquo;s
        too pure, too exalted a nature.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why? Would this lower him, then?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, but he&rsquo;s so used to a spiritual life that he
        can&rsquo;t reconcile himself with actual fact, and Varenka is after all
        fact.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly, without
        taking the trouble of clothing it in exact language. He knew that his
        wife, in such moments of loving tenderness as now, would understand what
        he meant to say from a hint, and she did understand him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but there&rsquo;s not so much of that actual fact about her
        as about me. I can see that he would never have cared for me. She is
        altogether spiritual.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, he is so fond of you, and I am always so glad when my
        people like you....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s very nice to me; but....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as it was with poor Nikolay ... you really cared
        for each other,&rdquo; Levin finished. &ldquo;Why not speak of
        him?&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I sometimes blame myself for not; it ends
        in one&rsquo;s forgetting. Ah, how terrible and dear he was!... Yes,
        what were we talking about?&rdquo; Levin said, after a pause.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You think he can&rsquo;t fall in love,&rdquo; said Kitty,
        translating into her own language.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so much that he can&rsquo;t fall in love,&rdquo;
        Levin said, smiling, &ldquo;but he has not the weakness necessary....
        I&rsquo;ve always envied him, and even now, when I&rsquo;m so happy, I
        still envy him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You envy him for not being able to fall in love?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I envy him for being better than I,&rdquo; said Levin. &ldquo;He
        does not live for himself. His whole life is subordinated to his duty.
        And that&rsquo;s why he can be calm and contented.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; Kitty asked, with an ironical and loving smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        She could never have explained the chain of thought that made her smile;
        but the last link in it was that her husband, in exalting his brother
        and abasing himself, was not quite sincere. Kitty knew that this
        insincerity came from his love for his brother, from his sense of shame
        at being too happy, and above all from his unflagging craving to be
        better&mdash;she loved it in him, and so she smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And you? What are you dissatisfied with?&rdquo; she asked, with
        the same smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her disbelief in his self-dissatisfaction delighted him, and
        unconsciously he tried to draw her into giving utterance to the grounds
        of her disbelief.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am happy, but dissatisfied with myself....&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are
        happy?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, how shall I say?... In my heart I really care for nothing
        whatever but that you should not stumble&mdash;see? Oh, but really you
        mustn&rsquo;t skip about like that!&rdquo; he cried, breaking off to
        scold her for too agile a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in
        the path. &ldquo;But when I think about myself, and compare myself with
        others, especially with my brother, I feel I&rsquo;m a poor
        creature.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But in what way?&rdquo; Kitty pursued with the same smile.
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you too work for others? What about your co-operative
        settlement, and your work on the estate, and your book?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, but I feel, and particularly just now&mdash;it&rsquo;s your
        fault,&rdquo; he said, pressing her hand&mdash;&ldquo;that all that
        doesn&rsquo;t count. I do it in a way halfheartedly. If I could care for
        all that as I care for you!... Instead of that, I do it in these days
        like a task that is set me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what would you say about papa?&rdquo; asked Kitty.
        &ldquo;Is he a poor creature then, as he does nothing for the public
        good?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He?&mdash;no! But then one must have the simplicity, the
        straightforwardness, the goodness of your father: and I haven&rsquo;t
        got that. I do nothing, and I fret about it. It&rsquo;s all your doing.
        Before there was you&mdash;and <i>this</i> too,&rdquo; he added with a
        glance towards her waist that she understood&mdash;&ldquo;I put all my
        energies into work; now I can&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;m ashamed; I do it
        just as though it were a task set me, I&rsquo;m pretending....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, but would you like to change this minute with Sergey
        Ivanovitch?&rdquo; said Kitty. &ldquo;Would you like to do this work for
        the general good, and to love the task set you, as he does, and nothing
        else?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Levin. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m so happy
        that I don&rsquo;t understand anything. So you think he&rsquo;ll make
        her an offer today?&rdquo; he added after a brief silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think so, and I don&rsquo;t think so. Only, I&rsquo;m awfully
        anxious for it. Here, wait a minute.&rdquo; She stooped down and picked
        a wild camomile at the edge of the path. &ldquo;Come, count: he does
        propose, he doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, giving him the flower.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He does, he doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Levin, tearing off the
        white petals.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Kitty, snatching at his hand, stopped him. She had
        been watching his fingers with interest. &ldquo;You picked off
        two.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, but see, this little one shan&rsquo;t count to make
        up,&rdquo; said Levin, tearing off a little half-grown petal.
        &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the wagonette overtaking us.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you tired, Kitty?&rdquo; called the princess.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you are you can get in, as the horses are quiet and
        walking.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But it was not worth while to get in, they were quite near the place,
        and all walked on together.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 4</h3>

      <p>
        Varenka, with her white kerchief on her black hair, surrounded by the
        children, gaily and good-humoredly looking after them, and at the same
        time visibly excited at the possibility of receiving a declaration from
        the man she cared for, was very attractive. Sergey Ivanovitch walked
        beside her, and never left off admiring her. Looking at her, he recalled
        all the delightful things he had heard from her lips, all the good he
        knew about her, and became more and more conscious that the feeling he
        had for her was something special that he had felt long, long ago, and
        only once, in his early youth. The feeling of happiness in being near
        her continually grew, and at last reached such a point that, as he put a
        huge, slender-stalked agaric fungus in her basket, he looked straight
        into her face, and noticing the flush of glad and alarmed excitement
        that overspread her face, he was confused himself, and smiled to her in
        silence a smile that said too much.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If so,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I ought to think it over
        and make up my mind, and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a
        moment.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to pick by myself apart from all the rest, or
        else my efforts will make no show,&rdquo; he said, and he left the edge
        of the forest where they were walking on low silky grass between old
        birch trees standing far apart, and went more into the heart of the
        wood, where between the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of
        aspen and dark bushes of hazel. Walking some forty paces away, Sergey
        Ivanovitch, knowing he was out of sight, stood still behind a bushy
        spindle-tree in full flower with its rosy red catkins. It was perfectly
        still all round him. Only overhead in the birches under which he stood,
        the flies, like a swarm of bees, buzzed unceasingly, and from time to
        time the children&rsquo;s voices were floated across to him. All at once
        he heard, not far from the edge of the wood, the sound of
        Varenka&rsquo;s contralto voice, calling Grisha, and a smile of delight
        passed over Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s face. Conscious of this smile, he
        shook his head disapprovingly at his own condition, and taking out a
        cigar, he began lighting it. For a long while he could not get a match
        to light against the trunk of a birch tree. The soft scales of the white
        bark rubbed off the phosphorus, and the light went out. At last one of
        the matches burned, and the fragrant cigar smoke, hovering uncertainly
        in flat, wide coils, stretched away forwards and upwards over a bush
        under the overhanging branches of a birch tree. Watching the streak of
        smoke, Sergey Ivanovitch walked gently on, deliberating on his position.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;If it were only a passing
        fancy or a passion, if it were only this attraction&mdash;this mutual
        attraction (I can call it a <i>mutual</i> attraction), but if I felt
        that it was in contradiction with the whole bent of my life&mdash;if I
        felt that in giving way to this attraction I should be false to my
        vocation and my duty ... but it&rsquo;s not so. The only thing I can say
        against it is that, when I lost Marie, I said to myself that I would
        remain faithful to her memory. That&rsquo;s the only thing I can say
        against my feeling.... That&rsquo;s a great thing,&rdquo; Sergey
        Ivanovitch said to himself, feeling at the same time that this
        consideration had not the slightest importance for him personally, but
        would only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of
        others. &ldquo;But apart from that, however much I searched, I should
        never find anything to say against my feeling. If I were choosing by
        considerations of suitability alone, I could not have found anything
        better.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        However many women and girls he thought of whom he knew, he could not
        think of a girl who united to such a degree all, positively all, the
        qualities he would wish to see in his wife. She had all the charm and
        freshness of youth, but she was not a child; and if she loved him, she
        loved him consciously as a woman ought to love; that was one thing.
        Another point: she was not only far from being worldly, but had an
        unmistakable distaste for worldly society, and at the same time she knew
        the world, and had all the ways of a woman of the best society, which
        were absolutely essential to Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s conception of the
        woman who was to share his life. Thirdly: she was religious, and not
        like a child, unconsciously religious and good, as Kitty, for example,
        was, but her life was founded on religious principles. Even in trifling
        matters, Sergey Ivanovitch found in her all that he wanted in his wife:
        she was poor and alone in the world, so she would not bring with her a
        mass of relations and their influence into her husband&rsquo;s house, as
        he saw now in Kitty&rsquo;s case. She would owe everything to her
        husband, which was what he had always desired too for his future family
        life. And this girl, who united all these qualities, loved him. He was a
        modest man, but he could not help seeing it. And he loved her. There was
        one consideration against it&mdash;his age. But he came of a long-lived
        family, he had not a single gray hair, no one would have taken him for
        forty, and he remembered Varenka&rsquo;s saying that it was only in
        Russia that men of fifty thought themselves old, and that in France a
        man of fifty considers himself <i>dans la force de l&rsquo;âge</i>,
        while a man of forty is <i>un jeune homme</i>. But what did the mere
        reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been
        twenty years ago? Was it not youth to feel as he felt now, when coming
        from the other side to the edge of the wood he saw in the glowing light
        of the slanting sunbeams the gracious figure of Varenka in her yellow
        gown with her basket, walking lightly by the trunk of an old birch tree,
        and when this impression of the sight of Varenka blended so harmoniously
        with the beauty of the view, of the yellow oatfield lying bathed in the
        slanting sunshine, and beyond it the distant ancient forest flecked with
        yellow and melting into the blue of the distance? His heart throbbed
        joyously. A softened feeling came over him. He felt that he had made up
        his mind. Varenka, who had just crouched down to pick a mushroom, rose
        with a supple movement and looked round. Flinging away the cigar, Sergey
        Ivanovitch advanced with resolute steps towards her.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 5</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Varvara Andreevna, when I was very young, I set before myself the
        ideal of the woman I loved and should be happy to call my wife. I have
        lived through a long life, and now for the first time I have met what I
        sought&mdash;in you. I love you, and offer you my hand.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch was saying this to himself while he was ten paces from
        Varvara. Kneeling down, with her hands over the mushrooms to guard them
        from Grisha, she was calling little Masha.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come here, little ones! There are so many!&rdquo; she was saying
        in her sweet, deep voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seeing Sergey Ivanovitch approaching, she did not get up and did not
        change her position, but everything told him that she felt his presence
        and was glad of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, did you find some?&rdquo; she asked from under the white
        kerchief, turning her handsome, gently smiling face to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not one,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch. &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She did not answer, busy with the children who thronged about her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That one too, near the twig,&rdquo; she pointed out to little
        Masha a little fungus, split in half across its rosy cap by the dry
        grass from under which it thrust itself. Varenka got up while Masha
        picked the fungus, breaking it into two white halves. &ldquo;This brings
        back my childhood,&rdquo; she added, moving apart from the children
        beside Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        They walked on for some steps in silence. Varenka saw that he wanted to
        speak; she guessed of what, and felt faint with joy and panic. They had
        walked so far away that no one could hear them now, but still he did not
        begin to speak. It would have been better for Varenka to be silent.
        After a silence it would have been easier for them to say what they
        wanted to say than after talking about mushrooms. But against her own
        will, as it were accidentally, Varenka said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you found nothing? In the middle of the wood there are always
        fewer, though.&rdquo; Sergey Ivanovitch sighed and made no answer. He
        was annoyed that she had spoken about the mushrooms. He wanted to bring
        her back to the first words she had uttered about her childhood; but
        after a pause of some length, as though against his own will, he made an
        observation in response to her last words.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have heard that the white edible funguses are found principally
        at the edge of the wood, though I can&rsquo;t tell them apart.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Some minutes more passed, they moved still further away from the
        children, and were quite alone. Varenka&rsquo;s heart throbbed so that
        she heard it beating, and felt that she was turning red and pale and red
        again.
      </p>

      <p>
        To be the wife of a man like Koznishev, after her position with Madame
        Stahl, was to her imagination the height of happiness. Besides, she was
        almost certain that she was in love with him. And this moment it would
        have to be decided. She felt frightened. She dreaded both his speaking
        and his not speaking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now or never it must be said&mdash;that Sergey Ivanovitch felt too.
        Everything in the expression, the flushed cheeks and the downcast eyes
        of Varenka betrayed a painful suspense. Sergey Ivanovitch saw it and
        felt sorry for her. He felt even that to say nothing now would be a
        slight to her. Rapidly in his own mind he ran over all the arguments in
        support of his decision. He even said over to himself the words in which
        he meant to put his offer, but instead of those words, some utterly
        unexpected reflection that occurred to him made him ask:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the difference between the &lsquo;birch&rsquo; mushroom
        and the &lsquo;white&rsquo; mushroom?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Varenka&rsquo;s lips quivered with emotion as she answered:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In the top part there is scarcely any difference, it&rsquo;s in
        the stalk.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And as soon as these words were uttered, both he and she felt that it
        was over, that what was to have been said would not be said; and their
        emotion, which had up to then been continually growing more intense,
        began to subside.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The birch mushroom&rsquo;s stalk suggests a dark man&rsquo;s chin
        after two days without shaving,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch, speaking
        quite calmly now.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; answered Varenka smiling, and
        unconsciously the direction of their walk changed. They began to turn
        towards the children. Varenka felt both sore and ashamed; at the same
        time she had a sense of relief.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he had got home again and went over the whole subject, Sergey
        Ivanovitch thought his previous decision had been a mistaken one. He
        could not be false to the memory of Marie.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Gently, children, gently!&rdquo; Levin shouted quite angrily to
        the children, standing before his wife to protect her when the crowd of
        children flew with shrieks of delight to meet them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Behind the children Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka walked out of the
        wood. Kitty had no need to ask Varenka; she saw from the calm and
        somewhat crestfallen faces of both that her plans had not come off.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; her husband questioned her as they were going home
        again.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t bite,&rdquo; said Kitty, her smile and manner of
        speaking recalling her father, a likeness Levin often noticed with
        pleasure.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How doesn&rsquo;t bite?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; she said, taking her husband&rsquo;s
        hand, lifting it to her mouth, and just faintly brushing it with closed
        lips. &ldquo;Like a kiss on a priest&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Which didn&rsquo;t it bite with?&rdquo; he said, laughing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Both. But it should have been like this....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There are some peasants coming....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, they didn&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 6</h3>

      <p>
        During the time of the children&rsquo;s tea the grown-up people sat in
        the balcony and talked as though nothing had happened, though they all,
        especially Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka, were very well aware that
        there had happened an event which, though negative, was of very great
        importance. They both had the same feeling, rather like that of a
        schoolboy after an examination, which has left him in the same class or
        shut him out of the school forever. Everyone present, feeling too that
        something had happened, talked eagerly about extraneous subjects. Levin
        and Kitty were particularly happy and conscious of their love that
        evening. And their happiness in their love seemed to imply a
        disagreeable slur on those who would have liked to feel the same and
        could not&mdash;and they felt a prick of conscience.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mark my words, Alexander will not come,&rdquo; said the old
        princess.
      </p>

      <p>
        That evening they were expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch to come down by
        train, and the old prince had written that possibly he might come too.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And I know why,&rdquo; the princess went on; &ldquo;he says that
        young people ought to be left alone for a while at first.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But papa has left us alone. We&rsquo;ve never seen him,&rdquo;
        said Kitty. &ldquo;Besides, we&rsquo;re not young
        people!&mdash;we&rsquo;re old, married people by now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Only if he doesn&rsquo;t come, I shall say good-bye to you
        children,&rdquo; said the princess, sighing mournfully.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What nonsense, mamma!&rdquo; both the daughters fell upon her at
        once.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you suppose he is feeling? Why, now....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the princess&rsquo;s
        voice. Her daughters were silent, and looked at one another.
        &ldquo;Maman always finds something to be miserable about,&rdquo; they
        said in that glance. They did not know that happy as the princess was in
        her daughter&rsquo;s house, and useful as she felt herself to be there,
        she had been extremely miserable, both on her own account and her
        husband&rsquo;s, ever since they had married their last and favorite
        daughter, and the old home had been left empty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it, Agafea Mihalovna?&rdquo; Kitty asked suddenly of
        Agafea Mihalovna, who was standing with a mysterious air, and a face
        full of meaning.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;About supper.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Dolly; &ldquo;you go and
        arrange about it, and I&rsquo;ll go and hear Grisha repeat his lesson,
        or else he will have nothing done all day.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my lesson! No, Dolly, I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; said
        Levin, jumping up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grisha, who was by now at a high school, had to go over the lessons of
        the term in the summer holidays. Darya Alexandrovna, who had been
        studying Latin with her son in Moscow before, had made it a rule on
        coming to the Levins&rsquo; to go over with him, at least once a day,
        the most difficult lessons of Latin and arithmetic. Levin had offered to
        take her place, but the mother, having once overheard Levin&rsquo;s
        lesson, and noticing that it was not given exactly as the teacher in
        Moscow had given it, said resolutely, though with much embarrassment and
        anxiety not to mortify Levin, that they must keep strictly to the book
        as the teacher had done, and that she had better undertake it again
        herself. Levin was amazed both at Stepan Arkadyevitch, who, by
        neglecting his duty, threw upon the mother the supervision of studies of
        which she had no comprehension, and at the teachers for teaching the
        children so badly. But he promised his sister-in-law to give the lessons
        exactly as she wished. And he went on teaching Grisha, not in his own
        way, but by the book, and so took little interest in it, and often
        forgot the hour of the lesson. So it had been today.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going, Dolly, you sit still,&rdquo; he said.
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it all properly, like the book. Only when Stiva
        comes, and we go out shooting, then we shall have to miss it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Levin went to Grisha.
      </p>

      <p>
        Varenka was saying the same thing to Kitty. Even in the happy,
        well-ordered household of the Levins Varenka had succeeded in making
        herself useful.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to the supper, you sit still,&rdquo; she said, and
        got up to go to Agafea Mihalovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, most likely they&rsquo;ve not been able to get
        chickens. If so, ours....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Agafea Mihalovna and I will see about it,&rdquo; and Varenka
        vanished with her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a nice girl!&rdquo; said the princess.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not nice, maman; she&rsquo;s an exquisite girl; there&rsquo;s no
        one else like her.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you are expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch today?&rdquo; said
        Sergey Ivanovitch, evidently not disposed to pursue the conversation
        about Varenka. &ldquo;It would be difficult to find two sons-in-law more
        unlike than yours,&rdquo; he said with a subtle smile. &ldquo;One all
        movement, only living in society, like a fish in water; the other our
        Kostya, lively, alert, quick in everything, but as soon as he is in
        society, he either sinks into apathy, or struggles helplessly like a
        fish on land.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s very heedless,&rdquo; said the princess,
        addressing Sergey Ivanovitch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been meaning, indeed, to
        ask you to tell him that it&rsquo;s out of the question for her&rdquo;
        (she indicated Kitty) &ldquo;to stay here; that she positively must come
        to Moscow. He talks of getting a doctor down....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Maman, he&rsquo;ll do everything; he has agreed to
        everything,&rdquo; Kitty said, angry with her mother for appealing to
        Sergey Ivanovitch to judge in such a matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses
        and the sound of wheels on the gravel. Dolly had not time to get up to
        go and meet her husband, when from the window of the room below, where
        Grisha was having his lesson, Levin leaped out and helped Grisha out
        after him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Stiva!&rdquo; Levin shouted from under the balcony.
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve finished, Dolly, don&rsquo;t be afraid!&rdquo; he
        added, and started running like a boy to meet the carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Is ea id, ejus, ejus, ejus!</i>&rdquo; shouted Grisha,
        skipping along the avenue.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And someone else too! Papa, of course!&rdquo; cried Levin,
        stopping at the entrance of the avenue. &ldquo;Kitty, don&rsquo;t come
        down the steep staircase, go round.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But Levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the carriage
        for the old prince. As he got nearer to the carriage he saw beside
        Stepan Arkadyevitch not the prince but a handsome, stout young man in a
        Scotch cap, with long ends of ribbon behind. This was Vassenka
        Veslovsky, a distant cousin of the Shtcherbatskys, a brilliant young
        gentleman in Petersburg and Moscow society. &ldquo;A capital fellow, and
        a keen sportsman,&rdquo; as Stepan Arkadyevitch said, introducing him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his having come in
        place of the old prince, Veslovsky greeted Levin gaily, claiming
        acquaintance with him in the past, and snatching up Grisha into the
        carriage, lifted him over the pointer that Stepan Arkadyevitch had
        brought with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin did not get into the carriage, but walked behind. He was rather
        vexed at the non-arrival of the old prince, whom he liked more and more
        the more he saw of him, and also at the arrival of this Vassenka
        Veslovsky, a quite uncongenial and superfluous person. He seemed to him
        still more uncongenial and superfluous when, on approaching the steps
        where the whole party, children and grown-up, were gathered together in
        much excitement, Levin saw Vassenka Veslovsky, with a particularly warm
        and gallant air, kissing Kitty&rsquo;s hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Your wife and I are cousins and very old friends,&rdquo; said
        Vassenka Veslovsky, once more shaking Levin&rsquo;s hand with great
        warmth.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, are there plenty of birds?&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch said
        to Levin, hardly leaving time for everyone to utter their greetings.
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come with the most savage intentions. Why, maman,
        they&rsquo;ve not been in Moscow since! Look, Tanya, here&rsquo;s
        something for you! Get it, please, it&rsquo;s in the carriage,
        behind!&rdquo; he talked in all directions. &ldquo;How pretty
        you&rsquo;ve grown, Dolly,&rdquo; he said to his wife, once more kissing
        her hand, holding it in one of his, and patting it with the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin, who a minute before had been in the happiest frame of mind, now
        looked darkly at everyone, and everything displeased him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who was it he kissed yesterday with those lips?&rdquo; he
        thought, looking at Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s tender demonstrations to
        his wife. He looked at Dolly, and he did not like her either.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t believe in his love. So what is she so pleased
        about? Revolting!&rdquo; thought Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked at the princess, who had been so dear to him a minute before,
        and he did not like the manner in which she welcomed this Vassenka, with
        his ribbons, just as though she were in her own house.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even Sergey Ivanovitch, who had come out too onto the steps, seemed to
        him unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he met Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, though Levin knew that his brother neither liked nor
        respected Oblonsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        And Varenka, even she seemed hateful, with her air
        <i>sainte nitouche</i>
        making the acquaintance of this gentleman, while all the while she was
        thinking of nothing but getting married.
      </p>

      <p>
        And more hateful than anyone was Kitty for falling in with the tone of
        gaiety with which this gentleman regarded his visit in the country, as
        though it were a holiday for himself and everyone else. And, above all,
        unpleasant was that particular smile with which she responded to his
        smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Noisily talking, they all went into the house; but as soon as they were
        all seated, Levin turned and went out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty saw something was wrong with her husband. She tried to seize a
        moment to speak to him alone, but he made haste to get away from her,
        saying he was wanted at the counting-house. It was long since his own
        work on the estate had seemed to him so important as at that moment.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all holiday for them,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;but
        these are no holiday matters, they won&rsquo;t wait, and there&rsquo;s
        no living without them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 7</h3>

      <p>
        Levin came back to the house only when they sent to summon him to
        supper. On the stairs were standing Kitty and Agafea Mihalovna,
        consulting about wines for supper.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But why are you making all this fuss? Have what we usually
        do.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, Stiva doesn&rsquo;t drink ... Kostya, stop, what&rsquo;s the
        matter?&rdquo; Kitty began, hurrying after him, but he strode ruthlessly
        away to the dining-room without waiting for her, and at once joined in
        the lively general conversation which was being maintained there by
        Vassenka Veslovsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what do you say, are we going shooting tomorrow?&rdquo;
        said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Please, do let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; said Veslovsky, moving to
        another chair, where he sat down sideways, with one fat leg crossed
        under him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall be delighted, we will go. And have you had any shooting
        yet this year?&rdquo; said Levin to Veslovsky, looking intently at his
        leg, but speaking with that forced amiability that Kitty knew so well in
        him, and that was so out of keeping with him. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
        answer for our finding grouse, but there are plenty of snipe. Only we
        ought to start early. You&rsquo;re not tired? Aren&rsquo;t you tired,
        Stiva?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Me tired? I&rsquo;ve never been tired yet. Suppose we stay up all
        night. Let&rsquo;s go for a walk!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, really, let&rsquo;s not go to bed at all! Capital!&rdquo;
        Veslovsky chimed in.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, we all know you can do without sleep, and keep other people
        up too,&rdquo; Dolly said to her husband, with that faint note of irony
        in her voice which she almost always had now with her husband.
        &ldquo;But to my thinking, it&rsquo;s time for bed now.... I&rsquo;m
        going, I don&rsquo;t want supper.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, do stay a little, Dolly,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        going round to her side behind the table where they were having supper.
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve so much still to tell you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing really, I suppose.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know Veslovsky has been at Anna&rsquo;s, and he&rsquo;s
        going to them again? You know they&rsquo;re hardly fifty miles from you,
        and I too must certainly go over there. Veslovsky, come here!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vassenka crossed over to the ladies, and sat down beside Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, do tell me, please; you have stayed with her? How was
        she?&rdquo; Darya Alexandrovna appealed to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin was left at the other end of the table, and though never pausing
        in his conversation with the princess and Varenka, he saw that there was
        an eager and mysterious conversation going on between Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, Dolly, Kitty, and Veslovsky. And that was not all. He saw
        on his wife&rsquo;s face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with
        fixed eyes on the handsome face of Vassenka, who was telling them
        something with great animation.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exceedingly nice at their place,&rdquo; Veslovsky was
        telling them about Vronsky and Anna. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, of course,
        take it upon myself to judge, but in their house you feel the real
        feeling of home.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do they intend doing?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I believe they think of going to Moscow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together!
        When are you going there?&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Vassenka.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m spending July there.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you go?&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch said to his wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wanting to a long while; I shall certainly
        go,&rdquo; said Dolly. &ldquo;I am sorry for her, and I know her.
        She&rsquo;s a splendid woman. I will go alone, when you go back, and
        then I shall be in no one&rsquo;s way. And it will be better indeed
        without you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;And you,
        Kitty?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I? Why should I go?&rdquo; Kitty said, flushing all over, and she
        glanced round at her husband.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know Anna Arkadyevna, then?&rdquo; Veslovsky asked her.
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very fascinating woman.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered Veslovsky, crimsoning still more. She
        got up and walked across to her husband.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you going shooting, then, tomorrow?&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        His jealousy had in these few moments, especially at the flush that had
        overspread her cheeks while she was talking to Veslovsky, gone far
        indeed. Now as he heard her words, he construed them in his own fashion.
        Strange as it was to him afterwards to recall it, it seemed to him at
        the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting, all she
        cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to Vassenka
        Veslovsky, with whom, as he fancied, she was in love.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; he answered her in an unnatural
        voice, disagreeable to himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, better spend the day here tomorrow, or Dolly won&rsquo;t see
        anything of her husband, and set off the day after,&rdquo; said Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        The motive of Kitty&rsquo;s words was interpreted by Levin thus:
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t separate me from <i>him</i>. I don&rsquo;t care about
        <i>your</i> going, but do let me enjoy the society of this delightful
        young man.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, if you wish, we&rsquo;ll stay here tomorrow,&rdquo; Levin
        answered, with peculiar amiability.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vassenka meanwhile, utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence had
        occasioned, got up from the table after Kitty, and watching her with
        smiling and admiring eyes, he followed her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin saw that look. He turned white, and for a minute he could hardly
        breathe. &ldquo;How dare he look at my wife like that!&rdquo; was the
        feeling that boiled within him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Tomorrow, then? Do, please, let us go,&rdquo; said Vassenka,
        sitting down on a chair, and again crossing his leg as his habit was.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin&rsquo;s jealousy went further still. Already he saw himself a
        deceived husband, looked upon by his wife and her lover as simply
        necessary to provide them with the conveniences and pleasures of
        life.... But in spite of that he made polite and hospitable inquiries of
        Vassenka about his shooting, his gun, and his boots, and agreed to go
        shooting next day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Happily for Levin, the old princess cut short his agonies by getting up
        herself and advising Kitty to go to bed. But even at this point Levin
        could not escape another agony. As he said good-night to his hostess,
        Vassenka would again have kissed her hand, but Kitty, reddening, drew
        back her hand and said with a naïve bluntness, for which the old
        princess scolded her afterwards:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like that fashion.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        In Levin&rsquo;s eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations
        to arise, and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that she did
        not like them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, how can one want to go to bed!&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, who, after drinking several glasses of wine at supper, was
        now in his most charming and sentimental humor. &ldquo;Look,
        Kitty,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the moon, which had just risen behind
        the lime trees&mdash;&ldquo;how exquisite! Veslovsky, this is the time
        for a serenade. You know, he has a splendid voice; we practiced songs
        together along the road. He has brought some lovely songs with him, two
        new ones. Varvara Andreevna and he must sing some duets.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        When the party had broken up, Stepan Arkadyevitch walked a long while
        about the avenue with Veslovsky; their voices could be heard singing one
        of the new songs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy-chair in his
        wife&rsquo;s bedroom, and maintained an obstinate silence when she asked
        him what was wrong. But when at last with a timid glance she hazarded
        the question: &ldquo;Was there perhaps something you disliked about
        Veslovsky?&rdquo;&mdash;it all burst out, and he told her all. He was
        humiliated himself at what he was saying, and that exasperated him all
        the more.
      </p>

      <p>
        He stood facing her with his eyes glittering menacingly under his
        scowling brows, and he squeezed his strong arms across his chest, as
        though he were straining every nerve to hold himself in. The expression
        of his face would have been grim, and even cruel, if it had not at the
        same time had a look of suffering which touched her. His jaws were
        twitching, and his voice kept breaking.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You must understand that I&rsquo;m not jealous, that&rsquo;s a
        nasty word. I can&rsquo;t be jealous, and believe that.... I can&rsquo;t
        say what I feel, but this is awful.... I&rsquo;m not jealous, but
        I&rsquo;m wounded, humiliated that anybody dare think, that anybody dare
        look at you with eyes like that.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Eyes like what?&rdquo; said Kitty, trying as conscientiously as
        possible to recall every word and gesture of that evening and every
        shade implied in them.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the very bottom of her heart she did think there had been something
        precisely at the moment when he had crossed over after her to the other
        end of the table; but she dared not own it even to herself, and would
        have been even more unable to bring herself to say so to him, and so
        increase his suffering.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And what can there possibly be attractive about me as I am
        now?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, clutching at his head, &ldquo;you
        shouldn&rsquo;t say that!... If you had been attractive then....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, Kostya, oh, wait a minute, oh, do listen!&rdquo; she
        said, looking at him with an expression of pained commiseration.
        &ldquo;Why, what can you be thinking about! When for me there&rsquo;s no
        one in the world, no one, no one!... Would you like me never to see
        anyone?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        For the first minute she had been offended at his jealousy; she was
        angry that the slightest amusement, even the most innocent, should be
        forbidden her; but now she would readily have sacrificed, not merely
        such trifles, but everything, for his peace of mind, to save him from
        the agony he was suffering.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You must understand the horror and comedy of my position,&rdquo;
        he went on in a desperate whisper; &ldquo;that he&rsquo;s in my house,
        that he&rsquo;s done nothing improper positively except his free and
        easy airs and the way he sits on his legs. He thinks it&rsquo;s the best
        possible form, and so I&rsquo;m obliged to be civil to him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But, Kostya, you&rsquo;re exaggerating,&rdquo; said Kitty, at the
        bottom of her heart rejoicing at the depth of his love for her, shown
        now in his jealousy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The most awful part of it all is that you&rsquo;re just as you
        always are, and especially now when to me you&rsquo;re something sacred,
        and we&rsquo;re so happy, so particularly happy&mdash;and all of a
        sudden a little wretch.... He&rsquo;s not a little wretch; why should I
        abuse him? I have nothing to do with him. But why should my, and your,
        happiness....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know, I understand now what it&rsquo;s all come
        from,&rdquo; Kitty was beginning.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what? what?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I saw how you looked while we were talking at supper.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; Levin said in dismay.
      </p>

      <p>
        She told him what they had been talking about. And as she told him, she
        was breathless with emotion. Levin was silent for a space, then he
        scanned her pale and distressed face, and suddenly he clutched at his
        head.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Katya, I&rsquo;ve been worrying you! Darling, forgive me!
        It&rsquo;s madness! Katya, I&rsquo;m a criminal. And how could you be so
        distressed at such idiocy?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I was sorry for you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For me? for me? How mad I am!... But why make you miserable?
        It&rsquo;s awful to think that any outsider can shatter our
        happiness.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s humiliating too, of course.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, then I&rsquo;ll keep him here all the summer, and will
        overwhelm him with civility,&rdquo; said Levin, kissing her hands.
        &ldquo;You shall see. Tomorrow.... Oh, yes, we are going
        tomorrow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 8</h3>

      <p>
        Next day, before the ladies were up, the wagonette and a trap for the
        shooting party were at the door, and Laska, aware since early morning
        that they were going shooting, after much whining and darting to and
        fro, had sat herself down in the wagonette beside the coachman, and,
        disapproving of the delay, was excitedly watching the door from which
        the sportsmen still did not come out. The first to come out was Vassenka
        Veslovsky, in new high boots that reached half-way up his thick thighs,
        in a green blouse, with a new Russian leather cartridge-belt, and in his
        Scotch cap with ribbons, with a brand-new English gun without a sling.
        Laska flew up to him, welcomed him, and jumping up, asked him in her own
        way whether the others were coming soon, but getting no answer from him,
        she returned to her post of observation and sank into repose again, her
        head on one side, and one ear pricked up to listen. At last the door
        opened with a creak, and Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s spot-and-tan
        pointer Krak flew out, running round and round and turning over in the
        air. Stepan Arkadyevitch himself followed with a gun in his hand and a
        cigar in his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Good dog, good dog, Krak!&rdquo; he cried encouragingly to the
        dog, who put his paws up on his chest, catching at his game bag. Stepan
        Arkadyevitch was dressed in rough leggings and spats, in torn trousers
        and a short coat. On his head there was a wreck of a hat of indefinite
        form, but his gun of a new patent was a perfect gem, and his game bag
        and cartridge belt, though worn, were of the very best quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vassenka Veslovsky had had no notion before that it was truly
        <i>chic</i> for a sportsman to be in tatters, but to have his shooting
        outfit of the best quality. He saw it now as he looked at Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, radiant in his rags, graceful, well-fed, and joyous, a
        typical Russian nobleman. And he made up his mind that next time he went
        shooting he would certainly adopt the same get-up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and what about our host?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A young wife,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, and such a charming one!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He came down dressed. No doubt he&rsquo;s run up to her
        again.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch guessed right. Levin had run up again to his wife to
        ask her once more if she forgave him for his idiocy yesterday, and,
        moreover, to beg her for Christ&rsquo;s sake to be more careful. The
        great thing was for her to keep away from the children&mdash;they might
        any minute push against her. Then he had once more to hear her declare
        that she was not angry with him for going away for two days, and to beg
        her to be sure to send him a note next morning by a servant on
        horseback, to write him, if it were but two words only, to let him know
        that all was well with her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty was distressed, as she always was, at parting for a couple of days
        from her husband, but when she saw his eager figure, looking big and
        strong in his shooting-boots and his white blouse, and a sort of
        sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her, she forgot her
        own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure, and said good-bye to him
        cheerfully.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Pardon, gentlemen!&rdquo; he said, running out onto the steps.
        &ldquo;Have you put the lunch in? Why is the chestnut on the right?
        Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Laska, down; go and lie down!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Put it with the herd of oxen,&rdquo; he said to the herdsman, who
        was waiting for him at the steps with some question. &ldquo;Excuse me,
        here comes another villain.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin jumped out of the wagonette, in which he had already taken his
        seat, to meet the carpenter, who came towards the steps with a rule in
        his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t come to the counting house yesterday, and now
        you&rsquo;re detaining me. Well, what is it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Would your honor let me make another turning? It&rsquo;s only
        three steps to add. And we make it just fit at the same time. It will be
        much more convenient.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You should have listened to me,&rdquo; Levin answered with
        annoyance. &ldquo;I said: Put the lines and then fit in the steps. Now
        there&rsquo;s no setting it right. Do as I told you, and make a new
        staircase.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The point was that in the lodge that was being built the carpenter had
        spoiled the staircase, fitting it together without calculating the space
        it was to fill, so that the steps were all sloping when it was put in
        place. Now the carpenter wanted, keeping the same staircase, to add
        three steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It will be much better.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But where&rsquo;s your staircase coming out with its three
        steps?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, upon my word, sir,&rdquo; the carpenter said with a
        contemptuous smile. &ldquo;It comes out right at the very spot. It
        starts, so to speak,&rdquo; he said, with a persuasive gesture;
        &ldquo;it comes down, and comes down, and comes out.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But three steps will add to the length too ... where is it to
        come out?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, to be sure, it&rsquo;ll start from the bottom and go up and
        go up, and come out so,&rdquo; the carpenter said obstinately and
        convincingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll reach the ceiling and the wall.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Upon my word! Why, it&rsquo;ll go up, and up, and come out like
        this.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin took out a ramrod and began sketching him the staircase in the
        dust.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There, do you see?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;As your honor likes,&rdquo; said the carpenter, with a sudden
        gleam in his eyes, obviously understanding the thing at last. &ldquo;It
        seems it&rsquo;ll be best to make a new one.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, do it as you&rsquo;re told,&rdquo; Levin shouted,
        seating himself in the wagonette. &ldquo;Down! Hold the dogs,
        Philip!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin felt now at leaving behind all his family and household cares such
        an eager sense of joy in life and expectation that he was not disposed
        to talk. Besides that, he had that feeling of concentrated excitement
        that every sportsman experiences as he approaches the scene of action.
        If he had anything on his mind at that moment, it was only the doubt
        whether they would start anything in the Kolpensky marsh, whether Laska
        would show to advantage in comparison with Krak, and whether he would
        shoot well that day himself. Not to disgrace himself before a new
        spectator&mdash;not to be outdone by Oblonsky&mdash;that too was a
        thought that crossed his brain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oblonsky was feeling the same, and he too was not talkative. Vassenka
        Veslovsky kept up alone a ceaseless flow of cheerful chatter. As he
        listened to him now, Levin felt ashamed to think how unfair he had been
        to him the day before. Vassenka was really a nice fellow, simple,
        good-hearted, and very good-humored. If Levin had met him before he was
        married, he would have made friends with him. Levin rather disliked his
        holiday attitude to life and a sort of free and easy assumption of
        elegance. It was as though he assumed a high degree of importance in
        himself that could not be disputed, because he had long nails and a
        stylish cap, and everything else to correspond; but this could be
        forgiven for the sake of his good nature and good breeding. Levin liked
        him for his good education, for speaking French and English with such an
        excellent accent, and for being a man of his world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vassenka was extremely delighted with the left horse, a horse of the Don
        Steppes. He kept praising him enthusiastically. &ldquo;How fine it must
        be galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse! Eh? isn&rsquo;t
        it?&rdquo; he said. He had imagined riding on a steppe horse as
        something wild and romantic, and it turned out nothing of the sort. But
        his simplicity, particularly in conjunction with his good looks, his
        amiable smile, and the grace of his movements, was very attractive.
        Either because his nature was sympathetic to Levin, or because Levin was
        trying to atone for his sins of the previous evening by seeing nothing
        but what was good in him, anyway he liked his society.
      </p>

      <p>
        After they had driven over two miles from home, Veslovsky all at once
        felt for a cigar and his pocketbook, and did not know whether he had
        lost them or left them on the table. In the pocketbook there were
        thirty-seven pounds, and so the matter could not be left in uncertainty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know what, Levin, I&rsquo;ll gallop home on that left
        trace-horse. That will be splendid. Eh?&rdquo; he said, preparing to get
        out.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, why should you?&rdquo; answered Levin, calculating that
        Vassenka could hardly weigh less than seventeen stone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
        send the coachman.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The coachman rode back on the trace-horse, and Levin himself drove the
        remaining pair.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 9</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, now what&rsquo;s our plan of campaign? Tell us all about
        it,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Our plan is this. Now we&rsquo;re driving to Gvozdyov. In
        Gvozdyov there&rsquo;s a grouse marsh on this side, and beyond Gvozdyov
        come some magnificent snipe marshes where there are grouse too.
        It&rsquo;s hot now, and we&rsquo;ll get there&mdash;it&rsquo;s fifteen
        miles or so&mdash;towards evening and have some evening shooting;
        we&rsquo;ll spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the bigger
        moors.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And is there nothing on the way?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but we&rsquo;ll reserve ourselves; besides it&rsquo;s hot.
        There are two nice little places, but I doubt there being anything to
        shoot.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin would himself have liked to go into these little places, but they
        were near home; he could shoot them over any time, and they were only
        little places&mdash;there would hardly be room for three to shoot. And
        so, with some insincerity, he said that he doubted there being anything
        to shoot. When they reached a little marsh Levin would have driven by,
        but Stepan Arkadyevitch, with the experienced eye of a sportsman, at
        once detected reeds visible from the road.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t we try that?&rdquo; he said, pointing to the little
        marsh.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Levin, do, please! how delightful!&rdquo; Vassenka Veslovsky
        began begging, and Levin could but consent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before they had time to stop, the dogs had flown one before the other
        into the marsh.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Krak! Laska!...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The dogs came back.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be room for three. I&rsquo;ll stay here,&rdquo;
        said Levin, hoping they would find nothing but peewits, who had been
        startled by the dogs, and turning over in their flight, were plaintively
        wailing over the marsh.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No! Come along, Levin, let&rsquo;s go together!&rdquo; Veslovsky
        called.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Really, there&rsquo;s not room. Laska, back, Laska! You
        won&rsquo;t want another dog, will you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin remained with the wagonette, and looked enviously at the
        sportsmen. They walked right across the marsh. Except little birds and
        peewits, of which Vassenka killed one, there was nothing in the marsh.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, you see now that it was not that I grudged the
        marsh,&rdquo; said Levin, &ldquo;only it&rsquo;s wasting time.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, it was jolly all the same. Did you see us?&rdquo; said
        Vassenka Veslovsky, clambering awkwardly into the wagonette with his gun
        and his peewit in his hands. &ldquo;How splendidly I shot this bird!
        Didn&rsquo;t I? Well, shall we soon be getting to the real place?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The horses started off suddenly, Levin knocked his head against the
        stock of someone&rsquo;s gun, and there was the report of a shot. The
        gun did actually go off first, but that was how it seemed to Levin. It
        appeared that Vassenka Veslovsky had pulled only one trigger, and had
        left the other hammer still cocked. The charge flew into the ground
        without doing harm to anyone. Stepan Arkadyevitch shook his head and
        laughed reprovingly at Veslovsky. But Levin had not the heart to reprove
        him. In the first place, any reproach would have seemed to be called
        forth by the danger he had incurred and the bump that had come up on
        Levin&rsquo;s forehead. And besides, Veslovsky was at first so naïvely
        distressed, and then laughed so good-humoredly and infectiously at their
        general dismay, that one could not but laugh with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they reached the second marsh, which was fairly large, and would
        inevitably take some time to shoot over, Levin tried to persuade them to
        pass it by. But Veslovsky again overpersuaded him. Again, as the marsh
        was narrow, Levin, like a good host, remained with the carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Krak made straight for some clumps of sedge. Vassenka Veslovsky was the
        first to run after the dog. Before Stepan Arkadyevitch had time to come
        up, a grouse flew out. Veslovsky missed it and it flew into an unmown
        meadow. This grouse was left for Veslovsky to follow up. Krak found it
        again and pointed, and Veslovsky shot it and went back to the carriage.
        &ldquo;Now you go and I&rsquo;ll stay with the horses,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin had begun to feel the pangs of a sportsman&rsquo;s envy. He handed
        the reins to Veslovsky and walked into the marsh.
      </p>

      <p>
        Laska, who had been plaintively whining and fretting against the
        injustice of her treatment, flew straight ahead to a hopeful place that
        Levin knew well, and that Krak had not yet come upon.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stop her?&rdquo; shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t scare them,&rdquo; answered Levin, sympathizing
        with his bitch&rsquo;s pleasure and hurrying after her.
      </p>

      <p>
        As she came nearer and nearer to the familiar breeding places there was
        more and more earnestness in Laska&rsquo;s exploration. A little marsh
        bird did not divert her attention for more than an instant. She made one
        circuit round the clump of reeds, was beginning a second, and suddenly
        quivered with excitement and became motionless.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, come, Stiva!&rdquo; shouted Levin, feeling his heart
        beginning to beat more violently; and all of a sudden, as though some
        sort of shutter had been drawn back from his straining ears, all sounds,
        confused but loud, began to beat on his hearing, losing all sense of
        distance. He heard the steps of Stepan Arkadyevitch, mistaking them for
        the tramp of the horses in the distance; he heard the brittle sound of
        the twigs on which he had trodden, taking this sound for the flying of a
        grouse. He heard too, not far behind him, a splashing in the water,
        which he could not explain to himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Picking his steps, he moved up to the dog.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Fetch it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Not a grouse but a snipe flew up from beside the dog. Levin had lifted
        his gun, but at the very instant when he was taking aim, the sound of
        splashing grew louder, came closer, and was joined with the sound of
        Veslovsky&rsquo;s voice, shouting something with strange loudness. Levin
        saw he had his gun pointed behind the snipe, but still he fired.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he had made sure he had missed, Levin looked round and saw the
        horses and the wagonette not on the road but in the marsh.
      </p>

      <p>
        Veslovsky, eager to see the shooting, had driven into the marsh, and got
        the horses stuck in the mud.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Damn the fellow!&rdquo; Levin said to himself, as he went back to
        the carriage that had sunk in the mire. &ldquo;What did you drive in
        for?&rdquo; he said to him dryly, and calling the coachman, he began
        pulling the horses out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his horses
        getting stuck in the mud, and still more at the fact that neither Stepan
        Arkadyevitch nor Veslovsky helped him and the coachman to unharness the
        horses and get them out, since neither of them had the slightest notion
        of harnessing. Without vouchsafing a syllable in reply to
        Vassenka&rsquo;s protestations that it had been quite dry there, Levin
        worked in silence with the coachman at extricating the horses. But then,
        as he got warm at the work and saw how assiduously Veslovsky was tugging
        at the wagonette by one of the mud-guards, so that he broke it indeed,
        Levin blamed himself for having under the influence of yesterday&rsquo;s
        feelings been too cold to Veslovsky, and tried to be particularly genial
        so as to smooth over his chilliness. When everything had been put right,
        and the carriage had been brought back to the road, Levin had the lunch
        served.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i
          >Bon appétit&mdash;bonne conscience! Ce poulet va tomber
          jusqu&rsquo;au fond de mes bottes</i
        >,&rdquo; Vassenka, who had recovered his spirits, quoted the French
        saying as he finished his second chicken. &ldquo;Well, now our troubles
        are over, now everything&rsquo;s going to go well. Only, to atone for my
        sins, I&rsquo;m bound to sit on the box. That&rsquo;s so? eh? No, no!
        I&rsquo;ll be your Automedon. You shall see how I&rsquo;ll get you
        along,&rdquo; he answered, not letting go the rein, when Levin begged
        him to let the coachman drive. &ldquo;No, I must atone for my sins, and
        I&rsquo;m very comfortable on the box.&rdquo; And he drove.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin was a little afraid he would exhaust the horses, especially the
        chestnut, whom he did not know how to hold in; but unconsciously he fell
        under the influence of his gaiety and listened to the songs he sang all
        the way on the box, or the descriptions and representations he gave of
        driving in the English fashion, four-in-hand; and it was in the very
        best of spirits that after lunch they drove to the Gvozdyov marsh.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 10</h3>

      <p>
        Vassenka drove the horses so smartly that they reached the marsh too
        early, while it was still hot.
      </p>

      <p>
        As they drew near this more important marsh, the chief aim of their
        expedition, Levin could not help considering how he could get rid of
        Vassenka and be free in his movements. Stepan Arkadyevitch evidently had
        the same desire, and on his face Levin saw the look of anxiety always
        present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting, together with a
        certain good-humored slyness peculiar to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How shall we go? It&rsquo;s a splendid marsh, I see, and there
        are hawks,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pointing to two great birds
        hovering over the reeds. &ldquo;Where there are hawks, there is sure to
        be game.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Levin, pulling up his boots and
        examining the lock of his gun with rather a gloomy expression, &ldquo;do
        you see those reeds?&rdquo; He pointed to an oasis of blackish green in
        the huge half-mown wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the
        river. &ldquo;The marsh begins here, straight in front of us, do you
        see&mdash;where it is greener? From here it runs to the right where the
        horses are; there are breeding places there, and grouse, and all round
        those reeds as far as that alder, and right up to the mill. Over there,
        do you see, where the pools are? That&rsquo;s the best place. There I
        once shot seventeen snipe. We&rsquo;ll separate with the dogs and go in
        different directions, and then meet over there at the mill.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, which shall go to left and which to right?&rdquo; asked
        Stepan Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wider to the right; you two go
        that way and I&rsquo;ll take the left,&rdquo; he said with apparent
        carelessness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Capital! we&rsquo;ll make the bigger bag! Yes, come along, come
        along!&rdquo; Vassenka exclaimed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin could do nothing but agree, and they divided.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as they entered the marsh, the two dogs began hunting about
        together and made towards the green, slime-covered pool. Levin knew
        Laska&rsquo;s method, wary and indefinite; he knew the place too and
        expected a whole covey of snipe.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Veslovsky, beside me, walk beside me!&rdquo; he said in a faint
        voice to his companion splashing in the water behind him. Levin could
        not help feeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed, after
        that casual shot near the Kolpensky marsh.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I won&rsquo;t get in your way, don&rsquo;t trouble about
        me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But Levin could not help troubling, and recalled Kitty&rsquo;s words at
        parting: &ldquo;Mind you don&rsquo;t shoot one another.&rdquo; The dogs
        came nearer and nearer, passed each other, each pursuing its own scent.
        The expectation of snipe was so intense that to Levin the squelching
        sound of his own heel, as he drew it up out of the mire, seemed to be
        the call of a snipe, and he clutched and pressed the lock of his gun.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Bang! bang!&rdquo; sounded almost in his ear. Vassenka had fired
        at a flock of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that
        moment towards the sportsmen, far out of range. Before Levin had time to
        look round, there was the whir of one snipe, another, a third, and some
        eight more rose one after another.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch hit one at the very moment when it was beginning its
        zigzag movements, and the snipe fell in a heap into the mud. Oblonsky
        aimed deliberately at another, still flying low in the reeds, and
        together with the report of the shot, that snipe too fell, and it could
        be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut, its unhurt wing
        showing white beneath.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin was not so lucky: he aimed at his first bird too low, and missed;
        he aimed at it again, just as it was rising, but at that instant another
        snipe flew up at his very feet, distracting him so that he missed again.
      </p>

      <p>
        While they were loading their guns, another snipe rose, and Veslovsky,
        who had had time to load again, sent two charges of small-shot into the
        water. Stepan Arkadyevitch picked up his snipe, and with sparkling eyes
        looked at Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, now let us separate,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and
        limping on his left foot, holding his gun in readiness and whistling to
        his dog, he walked off in one direction. Levin and Veslovsky walked in
        the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        It always happened with Levin that when his first shots were a failure
        he got hot and out of temper, and shot badly the whole day. So it was
        that day. The snipe showed themselves in numbers. They kept flying up
        from just under the dogs, from under the sportsmen&rsquo;s legs, and
        Levin might have retrieved his ill luck. But the more he shot, the more
        he felt disgraced in the eyes of Veslovsky, who kept popping away
        merrily and indiscriminately, killing nothing, and not in the slightest
        abashed by his ill success. Levin, in feverish haste, could not restrain
        himself, got more and more out of temper, and ended by shooting almost
        without a hope of hitting. Laska, indeed, seemed to understand this. She
        began looking more languidly, and gazed back at the sportsmen, as it
        were, with perplexity or reproach in her eyes. Shots followed shots in
        rapid succession. The smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen,
        while in the great roomy net of the game bag there were only three light
        little snipe. And of these one had been killed by Veslovsky alone, and
        one by both of them together. Meanwhile from the other side of the marsh
        came the sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s shots, not frequent, but,
        as Levin fancied, well-directed, for almost after each they heard
        &ldquo;Krak, Krak, <i>apporte</i>!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This excited Levin still more. The snipe were floating continually in
        the air over the reeds. Their whirring wings close to the earth, and
        their harsh cries high in the air, could be heard on all sides; the
        snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air, settled again
        before the sportsmen. Instead of two hawks there were now dozens of them
        hovering with shrill cries over the marsh.
      </p>

      <p>
        After walking through the larger half of the marsh, Levin and Veslovsky
        reached the place where the peasants&rsquo; mowing-grass was divided
        into long strips reaching to the reeds, marked off in one place by the
        trampled grass, in another by a path mown through it. Half of these
        strips had already been mown.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut part as
        the cut part, Levin had promised Stepan Arkadyevitch to meet him, and so
        he walked on with his companion through the cut and uncut patches.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Hi, sportsmen!&rdquo; shouted one of a group of peasants, sitting
        on an unharnessed cart; &ldquo;come and have some lunch with us! Have a
        drop of wine!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin looked round.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come along, it&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; shouted a
        good-humored-looking bearded peasant with a red face, showing his white
        teeth in a grin, and holding up a greenish bottle that flashed in the
        sunlight.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Qu&rsquo;est-ce qu&rsquo;ils disent</i>?&rdquo; asked
        Veslovsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They invite you to have some vodka. Most likely they&rsquo;ve
        been dividing the meadow into lots. I should have some,&rdquo; said
        Levin, not without some guile, hoping Veslovsky would be tempted by the
        vodka, and would go away to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why do they offer it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re merry-making. Really, you should join them. You
        would be interested.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;<i>Allons, c&rsquo;est curieux</i>.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You go, you go, you&rsquo;ll find the way to the mill!&rdquo;
        cried Levin, and looking round he perceived with satisfaction that
        Veslovsky, bent and stumbling with weariness, holding his gun out at
        arm&rsquo;s length, was making his way out of the marsh towards the
        peasants.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You come too!&rdquo; the peasants shouted to Levin. &ldquo;Never
        fear! You taste our cake!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin felt a strong inclination to drink a little vodka and to eat some
        bread. He was exhausted, and felt it a great effort to drag his
        staggering legs out of the mire, and for a minute he hesitated. But
        Laska was setting. And immediately all his weariness vanished, and he
        walked lightly through the swamp towards the dog. A snipe flew up at his
        feet; he fired and killed it. Laska still pointed.&mdash;&ldquo;Fetch
        it!&rdquo; Another bird flew up close to the dog. Levin fired. But it
        was an unlucky day for him; he missed it, and when he went to look for
        the one he had shot, he could not find that either. He wandered all
        about the reeds, but Laska did not believe he had shot it, and when he
        sent her to find it, she pretended to hunt for it, but did not really.
        And in the absence of Vassenka, on whom Levin threw the blame of his
        failure, things went no better. There were plenty of snipe still, but
        Levin made one miss after another.
      </p>

      <p>
        The slanting rays of the sun were still hot; his clothes, soaked through
        with perspiration, stuck to his body; his left boot full of water
        weighed heavily on his leg and squeaked at every step; the sweat ran in
        drops down his powder-grimed face, his mouth was full of the bitter
        taste, his nose of the smell of powder and stagnant water, his ears were
        ringing with the incessant whir of the snipe; he could not touch the
        stock of his gun, it was so hot; his heart beat with short, rapid
        throbs; his hands shook with excitement, and his weary legs stumbled and
        staggered over the hillocks and in the swamp, but still he walked on and
        still he shot. At last, after a disgraceful miss, he flung his gun and
        his hat on the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I must control myself,&rdquo; he said to himself. Picking up
        his gun and his hat, he called Laska, and went out of the swamp. When he
        got on to dry ground he sat down, pulled off his boot and emptied it,
        then walked to the marsh, drank some stagnant-tasting water, moistened
        his burning hot gun, and washed his face and hands. Feeling refreshed,
        he went back to the spot where a snipe had settled, firmly resolved to
        keep cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        He tried to be calm, but it was the same again. His finger pressed the
        cock before he had taken a good aim at the bird. It got worse and worse.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had only five birds in his game-bag when he walked out of the marsh
        towards the alders where he was to rejoin Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before he caught sight of Stepan Arkadyevitch he saw his dog. Krak
        darted out from behind the twisted root of an alder, black all over with
        the stinking mire of the marsh, and with the air of a conqueror sniffed
        at Laska. Behind Krak there came into view in the shade of the alder
        tree the shapely figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch. He came to meet him, red
        and perspiring, with unbuttoned neckband, still limping in the same way.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well? You have been popping away!&rdquo; he said, smiling
        good-humoredly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How have you got on?&rdquo; queried Levin. But there was no need
        to ask, for he had already seen the full game bag.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, pretty fair.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He had fourteen birds.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A splendid marsh! I&rsquo;ve no doubt Veslovsky got in your way.
        It&rsquo;s awkward too, shooting with one dog,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, to soften his triumph.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 11</h3>

      <p>
        When Levin and Stepan Arkadyevitch reached the peasant&rsquo;s hut where
        Levin always used to stay, Veslovsky was already there. He was sitting
        in the middle of the hut, clinging with both hands to the bench from
        which he was being pulled by a soldier, the brother of the
        peasant&rsquo;s wife, who was helping him off with his miry boots.
        Veslovsky was laughing his infectious, good-humored laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only just come. <i>Ils ont été charmants</i>. Just
        fancy, they gave me drink, fed me! Such bread, it was exquisite!
        <i>Délicieux!</i> And the vodka, I never tasted any better. And they
        would not take a penny for anything. And they kept saying: &lsquo;Excuse
        our homely ways.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What should they take anything for? They were entertaining you,
        to be sure. Do you suppose they keep vodka for sale?&rdquo; said the
        soldier, succeeding at last in pulling the soaked boot off the blackened
        stocking.
      </p>

      <p>
        In spite of the dirtiness of the hut, which was all muddied by their
        boots and the filthy dogs licking themselves clean, and the smell of
        marsh mud and powder that filled the room, and the absence of knives and
        forks, the party drank their tea and ate their supper with a relish only
        known to sportsmen. Washed and clean, they went into a hay-barn swept
        ready for them, where the coachman had been making up beds for the
        gentlemen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though it was dusk, not one of them wanted to go to sleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        After wavering among reminiscences and anecdotes of guns, of dogs, and
        of former shooting parties, the conversation rested on a topic that
        interested all of them. After Vassenka had several times over expressed
        his appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant
        hay, this delightful broken cart (he supposed it to be broken because
        the shafts had been taken out), of the good nature of the peasants that
        had treated him to vodka, of the dogs who lay at the feet of their
        respective masters, Oblonsky began telling them of a delightful shooting
        party at Malthus&rsquo;s, where he had stayed the previous summer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Malthus was a well-known capitalist, who had made his money by
        speculation in railway shares. Stepan Arkadyevitch described what grouse
        moors this Malthus had bought in the Tver province, and how they were
        preserved, and of the carriages and dogcarts in which the shooting party
        had been driven, and the luncheon pavilion that had been rigged up at
        the marsh.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said Levin, sitting up in
        the hay; &ldquo;how is it such people don&rsquo;t disgust you? I can
        understand a lunch with Lafitte is all very pleasant, but don&rsquo;t
        you dislike just that very sumptuousness? All these people, just like
        our spirit monopolists in old days, get their money in a way that gains
        them the contempt of everyone. They don&rsquo;t care for their contempt,
        and then they use their dishonest gains to buy off the contempt they
        have deserved.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perfectly true!&rdquo; chimed in Vassenka Veslovsky.
        &ldquo;Perfectly! Oblonsky, of course, goes out of <i>bonhomie</i>, but
        other people say: &lsquo;Well, Oblonsky stays with
        them.&rsquo;...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not a bit of it.&rdquo; Levin could hear that Oblonsky was
        smiling as he spoke. &ldquo;I simply don&rsquo;t consider him more
        dishonest than any other wealthy merchant or nobleman. They&rsquo;ve all
        made their money alike&mdash;by their work and their
        intelligence.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, by what work? Do you call it work to get hold of concessions
        and speculate with them?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s work. Work in this sense, that if it were
        not for him and others like him, there would have been no
        railways.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not work, like the work of a peasant or a
        learned profession.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Granted, but it&rsquo;s work in the sense that his activity
        produces a result&mdash;the railways. But of course you think the
        railways useless.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s another question; I am prepared to admit that
        they&rsquo;re useful. But all profit that is out of proportion to the
        labor expended is dishonest.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But who is to define what is proportionate?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Making profit by dishonest means, by trickery,&rdquo; said Levin,
        conscious that he could not draw a distinct line between honesty and
        dishonesty. &ldquo;Such as banking, for instance,&rdquo; he went on.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an evil&mdash;the amassing of huge fortunes without
        labor, just the same thing as with the spirit monopolies, it&rsquo;s
        only the form that&rsquo;s changed. <i>Le roi est mort, vive le roi</i>.
        No sooner were the spirit monopolies abolished than the railways came
        up, and banking companies; that, too, is profit without work.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that may all be very true and clever.... Lie down,
        Krak!&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch called to his dog, who was scratching
        and turning over all the hay. He was obviously convinced of the
        correctness of his position, and so talked serenely and without haste.
        &ldquo;But you have not drawn the line between honest and dishonest
        work. That I receive a bigger salary than my chief clerk, though he
        knows more about the work than I do&mdash;that&rsquo;s dishonest, I
        suppose?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, but I can tell you: your receiving some five thousand,
        let&rsquo;s say, for your work on the land, while our host, the peasant
        here, however hard he works, can never get more than fifty roubles, is
        just as dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk, and Malthus
        getting more than a station-master. No, quite the contrary; I see that
        society takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people, which
        is utterly baseless, and I fancy there&rsquo;s envy at the bottom of
        it....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s unfair,&rdquo; said Veslovsky; &ldquo;how could
        envy come in? There is something not nice about that sort of
        business.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You say,&rdquo; Levin went on, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s unjust for
        me to receive five thousand, while the peasant has fifty; that&rsquo;s
        true. It is unfair, and I feel it, but....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It really is. Why is it we spend our time riding, drinking,
        shooting, doing nothing, while they are forever at work?&rdquo; said
        Vassenka Veslovsky, obviously for the first time in his life reflecting
        on the question, and consequently considering it with perfect sincerity.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you feel it, but you don&rsquo;t give him your
        property,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, intentionally, as it seemed,
        provoking Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        There had arisen of late something like a secret antagonism between the
        two brothers-in-law; as though, since they had married sisters, a kind
        of rivalry had sprung up between them as to which was ordering his life
        best, and now this hostility showed itself in the conversation, as it
        began to take a personal note.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give it away, because no one demands that from me,
        and if I wanted to, I could not give it away,&rdquo; answered Levin,
        &ldquo;and have no one to give it to.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Give it to this peasant, he would not refuse it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but how am I to give it up? Am I to go to him and make a
        deed of conveyance?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but if you are convinced that you have no
        right....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all convinced. On the contrary, I feel I have no
        right to give it up, that I have duties both to the land and to my
        family.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, excuse me, but if you consider this inequality is unjust, why
        is it you don&rsquo;t act accordingly?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I do act negatively on that idea, so far as not trying to
        increase the difference of position existing between him and me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, excuse me, that&rsquo;s a paradox.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s something of a sophistry about that,&rdquo;
        Veslovsky agreed. &ldquo;Ah! our host; so you&rsquo;re not asleep
        yet?&rdquo; he said to the peasant who came into the barn, opening the
        creaking door. &ldquo;How is it you&rsquo;re not asleep?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, how&rsquo;s one to sleep! I thought our gentlemen would be
        asleep, but I heard them chattering. I want to get a hook from here. She
        won&rsquo;t bite?&rdquo; he added, stepping cautiously with his bare
        feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And where are you going to sleep?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We are going out for the night with the beasts.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, what a night!&rdquo; said Veslovsky, looking out at the edge
        of the hut and the unharnessed wagonette that could be seen in the faint
        light of the evening glow in the great frame of the open doors.
        &ldquo;But listen, there are women&rsquo;s voices singing, and, on my
        word, not badly too. Who&rsquo;s that singing, my friend?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the maids from hard by here.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, let&rsquo;s have a walk! We shan&rsquo;t go to
        sleep, you know. Oblonsky, come along!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If one could only do both, lie here and go,&rdquo; answered
        Oblonsky, stretching. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s capital lying here.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I shall go by myself,&rdquo; said Veslovsky, getting up
        eagerly, and putting on his shoes and stockings. &ldquo;Good-bye,
        gentlemen. If it&rsquo;s fun, I&rsquo;ll fetch you. You&rsquo;ve treated
        me to some good sport, and I won&rsquo;t forget you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He really is a capital fellow, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, when Veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had closed the
        door after him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, capital,&rdquo; answered Levin, still thinking of the
        subject of their conversation just before. It seemed to him that he had
        clearly expressed his thoughts and feelings to the best of his capacity,
        and yet both of them, straightforward men and not fools, had said with
        one voice that he was comforting himself with sophistries. This
        disconcerted him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just this, my dear boy. One must do one of two things:
        either admit that the existing order of society is just, and then stick
        up for one&rsquo;s rights in it; or acknowledge that you are enjoying
        unjust privileges, as I do, and then enjoy them and be satisfied.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, if it were unjust, you could not enjoy these advantages and
        be satisfied&mdash;at least I could not. The great thing for me is to
        feel that I&rsquo;m not to blame.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you say, why not go after all?&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, evidently weary of the strain of thought. &ldquo;We
        shan&rsquo;t go to sleep, you know. Come, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin did not answer. What they had said in the conversation, that he
        acted justly only in a negative sense, absorbed his thoughts. &ldquo;Can
        it be that it&rsquo;s only possible to be just negatively?&rdquo; he was
        asking himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How strong the smell of the fresh hay is, though,&rdquo; said
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a chance of
        sleeping. Vassenka has been getting up some fun there. Do you hear the
        laughing and his voice? Hadn&rsquo;t we better go? Come along!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not coming,&rdquo; answered Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Surely that&rsquo;s not a matter of principle too,&rdquo; said
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling, as he felt about in the dark for his cap.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a matter of principle, but why should I go?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself,&rdquo;
        said Stepan Arkadyevitch, finding his cap and getting up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you suppose I don&rsquo;t see the line you&rsquo;ve taken up
        with your wife? I heard how it&rsquo;s a question of the greatest
        consequence, whether or not you&rsquo;re to be away for a couple of
        days&rsquo; shooting. That&rsquo;s all very well as an idyllic episode,
        but for your whole life that won&rsquo;t answer. A man must be
        independent; he has his masculine interests. A man has to be
        manly,&rdquo; said Oblonsky, opening the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In what way? To go running after servant girls?&rdquo; said
        Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why not, if it amuses him? <i>Ça ne tire pas à conséquence</i>.
        It won&rsquo;t do my wife any harm, and it&rsquo;ll amuse me. The great
        thing is to respect the sanctity of the home. There should be nothing in
        the home. But don&rsquo;t tie your own hands.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said Levin dryly, and he turned on his side.
        &ldquo;Tomorrow, early, I want to go shooting, and I won&rsquo;t wake
        anyone, and shall set off at daybreak.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Messieurs, venez vite!</i>&rdquo; they heard the voice of
        Veslovsky coming back. &ldquo;<i>Charmante!</i> I&rsquo;ve made such a
        discovery. <i>Charmante!</i> a perfect Gretchen, and I&rsquo;ve already
        made friends with her. Really, exceedingly pretty,&rdquo; he declared in
        a tone of approval, as though she had been made pretty entirely on his
        account, and he was expressing his satisfaction with the entertainment
        that had been provided for him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin pretended to be asleep, while Oblonsky, putting on his slippers,
        and lighting a cigar, walked out of the barn, and soon their voices were
        lost.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a long while Levin could not get to sleep. He heard the horses
        munching hay, then he heard the peasant and his elder boy getting ready
        for the night, and going off for the night watch with the beasts, then
        he heard the soldier arranging his bed on the other side of the barn,
        with his nephew, the younger son of their peasant host. He heard the boy
        in his shrill little voice telling his uncle what he thought about the
        dogs, who seemed to him huge and terrible creatures, and asking what the
        dogs were going to hunt next day, and the soldier in a husky, sleepy
        voice, telling him the sportsmen were going in the morning to the marsh,
        and would shoot with their guns; and then, to check the boy&rsquo;s
        questions, he said, &ldquo;Go to sleep, Vaska; go to sleep, or
        you&rsquo;ll catch it,&rdquo; and soon after he began snoring himself,
        and everything was still. He could only hear the snort of the horses,
        and the guttural cry of a snipe.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it really only negative?&rdquo; he repeated to himself.
        &ldquo;Well, what of it? It&rsquo;s not my fault.&rdquo; And he began
        thinking about the next day.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll go out early, and I&rsquo;ll make a point of
        keeping cool. There are lots of snipe; and there are grouse too. When I
        come back there&rsquo;ll be the note from Kitty. Yes, Stiva may be
        right, I&rsquo;m not manly with her, I&rsquo;m tied to her
        apron-strings.... Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped! Negative
        again....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Half asleep, he heard the laughter and mirthful talk of Veslovsky and
        Stepan Arkadyevitch. For an instant he opened his eyes: the moon was up,
        and in the open doorway, brightly lighted up by the moonlight, they were
        standing talking. Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying something of the
        freshness of one girl, comparing her to a freshly peeled nut, and
        Veslovsky with his infectious laugh was repeating some words, probably
        said to him by a peasant: &ldquo;Ah, you do your best to get round
        her!&rdquo; Levin, half asleep, said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Gentlemen, tomorrow before daylight!&rdquo; and fell asleep.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 12</h3>

      <p>
        Waking up at earliest dawn, Levin tried to wake his companions.
        Vassenka, lying on his stomach, with one leg in a stocking thrust out,
        was sleeping so soundly that he could elicit no response. Oblonsky, half
        asleep, declined to get up so early. Even Laska, who was asleep, curled
        up in the hay, got up unwillingly, and lazily stretched out and
        straightened her hind legs one after the other. Getting on his boots and
        stockings, taking his gun, and carefully opening the creaking door of
        the barn, Levin went out into the road. The coachmen were sleeping in
        their carriages, the horses were dozing. Only one was lazily eating
        oats, dipping its nose into the manger. It was still gray out-of-doors.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why are you up so early, my dear?&rdquo; the old woman, their
        hostess, said, coming out of the hut and addressing him affectionately
        as an old friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Going shooting, granny. Do I go this way to the marsh?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Straight out at the back; by our threshing floor, my dear, and
        hemp patches; there&rsquo;s a little footpath.&rdquo; Stepping carefully
        with her sunburnt, bare feet, the old woman conducted Levin, and moved
        back the fence for him by the threshing floor.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Straight on and you&rsquo;ll come to the marsh. Our lads drove
        the cattle there yesterday evening.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Laska ran eagerly forward along the little path. Levin followed her with
        a light, rapid step, continually looking at the sky. He hoped the sun
        would not be up before he reached the marsh. But the sun did not delay.
        The moon, which had been bright when he went out, by now shone only like
        a crescent of quicksilver. The pink flush of dawn, which one could not
        help seeing before, now had to be sought to be discerned at all. What
        were before undefined, vague blurs in the distant countryside could now
        be distinctly seen. They were sheaves of rye. The dew, not visible till
        the sun was up, wetted Levin&rsquo;s legs and his blouse above his belt
        in the high growing, fragrant hemp patch, from which the pollen had
        already fallen out. In the transparent stillness of morning the smallest
        sounds were audible. A bee flew by Levin&rsquo;s ear with the whizzing
        sound of a bullet. He looked carefully, and saw a second and a third.
        They were all flying from the beehives behind the hedge, and they
        disappeared over the hemp patch in the direction of the marsh. The path
        led straight to the marsh. The marsh could be recognized by the mist
        which rose from it, thicker in one place and thinner in another, so that
        the reeds and willow bushes swayed like islands in this mist. At the
        edge of the marsh and the road, peasant boys and men, who had been
        herding for the night, were lying, and in the dawn all were asleep under
        their coats. Not far from them were three hobbled horses. One of them
        clanked a chain. Laska walked beside her master, pressing a little
        forward and looking round. Passing the sleeping peasants and reaching
        the first reeds, Levin examined his pistols and let his dog off. One of
        the horses, a sleek, dark-brown three-year-old, seeing the dog, started
        away, switched its tail and snorted. The other horses too were
        frightened, and splashing through the water with their hobbled legs, and
        drawing their hoofs out of the thick mud with a squelching sound, they
        bounded out of the marsh. Laska stopped, looking ironically at the
        horses and inquiringly at Levin. Levin patted Laska, and whistled as a
        sign that she might begin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Laska ran joyfully and anxiously through the slush that swayed under
        her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Running into the marsh among the familiar scents of roots, marsh plants,
        and slime, and the extraneous smell of horse dung, Laska detected at
        once a smell that pervaded the whole marsh, the scent of that
        strong-smelling bird that always excited her more than any other. Here
        and there among the moss and marsh plants this scent was very strong,
        but it was impossible to determine in which direction it grew stronger
        or fainter. To find the direction, she had to go farther away from the
        wind. Not feeling the motion of her legs, Laska bounded with a stiff
        gallop, so that at each bound she could stop short, to the right, away
        from the wind that blew from the east before sunrise, and turned facing
        the wind. Sniffing in the air with dilated nostrils, she felt at once
        that not their tracks only but they themselves were here before her, and
        not one, but many. Laska slackened her speed. They were here, but where
        precisely she could not yet determine. To find the very spot, she began
        to make a circle, when suddenly her master&rsquo;s voice drew her off.
        &ldquo;Laska! here?&rdquo; he asked, pointing her to a different
        direction. She stopped, asking him if she had better not go on doing as
        she had begun. But he repeated his command in an angry voice, pointing
        to a spot covered with water, where there could not be anything. She
        obeyed him, pretending she was looking, so as to please him, went round
        it, and went back to her former position, and was at once aware of the
        scent again. Now when he was not hindering her, she knew what to do, and
        without looking at what was under her feet, and to her vexation
        stumbling over a high stump into the water, but righting herself with
        her strong, supple legs, she began making the circle which was to make
        all clear to her. The scent of them reached her, stronger and stronger,
        and more and more defined, and all at once it became perfectly clear to
        her that one of them was here, behind this tuft of reeds, five paces in
        front of her; she stopped, and her whole body was still and rigid. On
        her short legs she could see nothing in front of her, but by the scent
        she knew it was sitting not more than five paces off. She stood still,
        feeling more and more conscious of it, and enjoying it in anticipation.
        Her tail was stretched straight and tense, and only wagging at the
        extreme end. Her mouth was slightly open, her ears raised. One ear had
        been turned wrong side out as she ran up, and she breathed heavily but
        warily, and still more warily looked round, but more with her eyes than
        her head, to her master. He was coming along with the face she knew so
        well, though the eyes were always terrible to her. He stumbled over the
        stump as he came, and moved, as she thought, extraordinarily slowly. She
        thought he came slowly, but he was running.
      </p>

      <p>
        Noticing Laska&rsquo;s special attitude as she crouched on the ground,
        as it were, scratching big prints with her hind paws, and with her mouth
        slightly open, Levin knew she was pointing at grouse, and with an inward
        prayer for luck, especially with the first bird, he ran up to her.
        Coming quite close up to her, he could from his height look beyond her,
        and he saw with his eyes what she was seeing with her nose. In a space
        between two little thickets, at a couple of yards&rsquo; distance, he
        could see a grouse. Turning its head, it was listening. Then lightly
        preening and folding its wings, it disappeared round a corner with a
        clumsy wag of its tail.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Fetch it, fetch it!&rdquo; shouted Levin, giving Laska a shove
        from behind.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; thought Laska. &ldquo;Where am I to
        go? From here I feel them, but if I move forward I shall know nothing of
        where they are or who they are.&rdquo; But then he shoved her with his
        knee, and in an excited whisper said, &ldquo;Fetch it, Laska.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s what he wishes, I&rsquo;ll do it, but I
        can&rsquo;t answer for myself now,&rdquo; she thought, and darted
        forward as fast as her legs would carry her between the thick bushes.
        She scented nothing now; she could only see and hear, without
        understanding anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ten paces from her former place a grouse rose with a guttural cry and
        the peculiar round sound of its wings. And immediately after the shot it
        splashed heavily with its white breast on the wet mire. Another bird did
        not linger, but rose behind Levin without the dog. When Levin turned
        towards it, it was already some way off. But his shot caught it. Flying
        twenty paces further, the second grouse rose upwards, and whirling round
        like a ball, dropped heavily on a dry place.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, this is going to be some good!&rdquo; thought Levin,
        packing the warm and fat grouse into his game bag. &ldquo;Eh, Laska,
        will it be good?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        When Levin, after loading his gun, moved on, the sun had fully risen,
        though unseen behind the storm-clouds. The moon had lost all of its
        luster, and was like a white cloud in the sky. Not a single star could
        be seen. The sedge, silvery with dew before, now shone like gold. The
        stagnant pools were all like amber. The blue of the grass had changed to
        yellow-green. The marsh birds twittered and swarmed about the brook and
        upon the bushes that glittered with dew and cast long shadows. A hawk
        woke up and settled on a haycock, turning its head from side to side and
        looking discontentedly at the marsh. Crows were flying about the field,
        and a bare-legged boy was driving the horses to an old man, who had got
        up from under his long coat and was combing his hair. The smoke from the
        gun was white as milk over the green of the grass.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the boys ran up to Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Uncle, there were ducks here yesterday!&rdquo; he shouted to him,
        and he walked a little way off behind him.
      </p>

      <p>
        And Levin was doubly pleased, in sight of the boy, who expressed his
        approval, at killing three snipe, one after another, straight off.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 13</h3>

      <p>
        The sportsman&rsquo;s saying, that if the first beast or the first bird
        is not missed, the day will be lucky, turned out correct.
      </p>

      <p>
        At ten o&rsquo;clock Levin, weary, hungry, and happy after a tramp of
        twenty miles, returned to his night&rsquo;s lodging with nineteen head
        of fine game and one duck, which he tied to his belt, as it would not go
        into the game bag. His companions had long been awake, and had had time
        to get hungry and have breakfast.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Wait a bit, wait a bit, I know there are nineteen,&rdquo; said
        Levin, counting a second time over the grouse and snipe, that looked so
        much less important now, bent and dry and bloodstained, with heads
        crooked aside, than they did when they were flying.
      </p>

      <p>
        The number was verified, and Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s envy pleased
        Levin. He was pleased too on returning to find the man sent by Kitty
        with a note was already there.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am perfectly well and happy. If you were uneasy about me, you
        can feel easier than ever. I&rsquo;ve a new bodyguard, Marya
        Vlasyevna,&rdquo;&mdash;this was the midwife, a new and important
        personage in Levin&rsquo;s domestic life. &ldquo;She has come to have a
        look at me. She found me perfectly well, and we have kept her till you
        are back. All are happy and well, and please, don&rsquo;t be in a hurry
        to come back, but, if the sport is good, stay another day.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        These two pleasures, his lucky shooting and the letter from his wife,
        were so great that two slightly disagreeable incidents passed lightly
        over Levin. One was that the chestnut trace horse, who had been
        unmistakably overworked on the previous day, was off his feed and out of
        sorts. The coachman said he was &ldquo;Overdriven yesterday, Konstantin
        Dmitrievitch. Yes, indeed! driven ten miles with no sense!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The other unpleasant incident, which for the first minute destroyed his
        good humor, though later he laughed at it a great deal, was to find that
        of all the provisions Kitty had provided in such abundance that one
        would have thought there was enough for a week, nothing was left. On his
        way back, tired and hungry from shooting, Levin had so distinct a vision
        of meat-pies that as he approached the hut he seemed to smell and taste
        them, as Laska had smelt the game, and he immediately told Philip to
        give him some. It appeared that there were no pies left, nor even any
        chicken.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, this fellow&rsquo;s appetite!&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, laughing and pointing at Vassenka Veslovsky. &ldquo;I
        never suffer from loss of appetite, but he&rsquo;s really
        marvelous!...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; said Levin, looking
        gloomily at Veslovsky. &ldquo;Well, Philip, give me some beef,
        then.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The beef&rsquo;s been eaten, and the bones given to the
        dogs,&rdquo; answered Philip.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin was so hurt that he said, in a tone of vexation, &ldquo;You might
        have left me something!&rdquo; and he felt ready to cry.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then put away the game,&rdquo; he said in a shaking voice to
        Philip, trying not to look at Vassenka, &ldquo;and cover them with some
        nettles. And you might at least ask for some milk for me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But when he had drunk some milk, he felt ashamed immediately at having
        shown his annoyance to a stranger, and he began to laugh at his hungry
        mortification.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the evening they went shooting again, and Veslovsky had several
        successful shots, and in the night they drove home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their homeward journey was as lively as their drive out had been.
        Veslovsky sang songs and related with enjoyment his adventures with the
        peasants, who had regaled him with vodka, and said to him, &ldquo;Excuse
        our homely ways,&rdquo; and his night&rsquo;s adventures with
        kiss-in-the-ring and the servant-girl and the peasant, who had asked him
        was he married, and on learning that he was not, said to him,
        &ldquo;Well, mind you don&rsquo;t run after other men&rsquo;s
        wives&mdash;you&rsquo;d better get one of your own.&rdquo; These words
        had particularly amused Veslovsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Altogether, I&rsquo;ve enjoyed our outing awfully. And you,
        Levin?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have, very much,&rdquo; Levin said quite sincerely. It was
        particularly delightful to him to have got rid of the hostility he had
        been feeling towards Vassenka Veslovsky at home, and to feel instead the
        most friendly disposition to him.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 14</h3>

      <p>
        Next day at ten o&rsquo;clock Levin, who had already gone his rounds,
        knocked at the room where Vassenka had been put for the night.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Entrez!</i>&rdquo; Veslovsky called to him. &ldquo;Excuse me,
        I&rsquo;ve only just finished my ablutions,&rdquo; he said, smiling,
        standing before him in his underclothes only.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me, please.&rdquo; Levin sat down in the window.
        &ldquo;Have you slept well?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Like the dead. What sort of day is it for shooting?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What will you take, tea or coffee?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Neither. I&rsquo;ll wait till lunch. I&rsquo;m really ashamed. I
        suppose the ladies are down? A walk now would be capital. You show me
        your horses.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        After walking about the garden, visiting the stable, and even doing some
        gymnastic exercises together on the parallel bars, Levin returned to the
        house with his guest, and went with him into the drawing-room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We had splendid shooting, and so many delightful
        experiences!&rdquo; said Veslovsky, going up to Kitty, who was sitting
        at the samovar. &ldquo;What a pity ladies are cut off from these
        delights!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I suppose he must say something to the lady of the
        house,&rdquo; Levin said to himself. Again he fancied something in the
        smile, in the all-conquering air with which their guest addressed
        Kitty....
      </p>

      <p>
        The princess, sitting on the other side of the table with Marya
        Vlasyevna and Stepan Arkadyevitch, called Levin to her side, and began
        to talk to him about moving to Moscow for Kitty&rsquo;s confinement, and
        getting ready rooms for them. Just as Levin had disliked all the trivial
        preparations for his wedding, as derogatory to the grandeur of the
        event, now he felt still more offensive the preparations for the
        approaching birth, the date of which they reckoned, it seemed, on their
        fingers. He tried to turn a deaf ear to these discussions of the best
        patterns of long clothes for the coming baby; tried to turn away and
        avoid seeing the mysterious, endless strips of knitting, the triangles
        of linen, and so on, to which Dolly attached special importance. The
        birth of a son (he was certain it would be a son) which was promised
        him, but which he still could not believe in&mdash;so marvelous it
        seemed&mdash;presented itself to his mind, on one hand, as a happiness
        so immense, and therefore so incredible; on the other, as an event so
        mysterious, that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would
        be, and consequent preparation for it, as for something ordinary that
        did happen to people, jarred on him as confusing and humiliating.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the princess did not understand his feelings, and put down his
        reluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference,
        and so she gave him no peace. She had commissioned Stepan Arkadyevitch
        to look at a flat, and now she called Levin up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know nothing about it, princess. Do as you think fit,&rdquo; he
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You must decide when you will move.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know. I know millions of children are born
        away from Moscow, and doctors ... why....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But if so....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, as Kitty wishes.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t talk to Kitty about it! Do you want me to frighten
        her? Why, this spring Natalia Golitzina died from having an ignorant
        doctor.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I will do just what you say,&rdquo; he said gloomily.
      </p>

      <p>
        The princess began talking to him, but he did not hear her. Though the
        conversation with the princess had indeed jarred upon him, he was
        gloomy, not on account of that conversation, but from what he saw at the
        samovar.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; he thought, glancing now and
        then at Vassenka bending over Kitty, telling her something with his
        charming smile, and at her, flushed and disturbed.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was something not nice in Vassenka&rsquo;s attitude, in his eyes,
        in his smile. Levin even saw something not nice in Kitty&rsquo;s
        attitude and look. And again the light died away in his eyes. Again, as
        before, all of a sudden, without the slightest transition, he felt cast
        down from a pinnacle of happiness, peace, and dignity, into an abyss of
        despair, rage, and humiliation. Again everything and everyone had become
        hateful to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You do just as you think best, princess,&rdquo; he said again,
        looking round.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Heavy is the cap of Monomach,&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch said
        playfully, hinting, evidently, not simply at the princess&rsquo;s
        conversation, but at the cause of Levin&rsquo;s agitation, which he had
        noticed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How late you are today, Dolly!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone got up to greet Darya Alexandrovna. Vassenka only rose for an
        instant, and with the lack of courtesy to ladies characteristic of the
        modern young man, he scarcely bowed, and resumed his conversation again,
        laughing at something.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been worried about Masha. She did not sleep well, and
        is dreadfully tiresome today,&rdquo; said Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The conversation Vassenka had started with Kitty was running on the same
        lines as on the previous evening, discussing Anna, and whether love is
        to be put higher than worldly considerations. Kitty disliked the
        conversation, and she was disturbed both by the subject and the tone in
        which it was conducted, and also by the knowledge of the effect it would
        have on her husband. But she was too simple and innocent to know how to
        cut short this conversation, or even to conceal the superficial pleasure
        afforded her by the young man&rsquo;s very obvious admiration. She
        wanted to stop it, but she did not know what to do. Whatever she did she
        knew would be observed by her husband, and the worst interpretation put
        on it. And, in fact, when she asked Dolly what was wrong with Masha, and
        Vassenka, waiting till this uninteresting conversation was over, began
        to gaze indifferently at Dolly, the question struck Levin as an
        unnatural and disgusting piece of hypocrisy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you say, shall we go and look for mushrooms today?&rdquo;
        said Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;By all means, please, and I shall come too,&rdquo; said Kitty,
        and she blushed. She wanted from politeness to ask Vassenka whether he
        would come, and she did not ask him. &ldquo;Where are you going,
        Kostya?&rdquo; she asked her husband with a guilty face, as he passed by
        her with a resolute step. This guilty air confirmed all his suspicions.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The mechanician came when I was away; I haven&rsquo;t seen him
        yet,&rdquo; he said, not looking at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        He went downstairs, but before he had time to leave his study he heard
        his wife&rsquo;s familiar footsteps running with reckless speed to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he said to her shortly. &ldquo;We are
        busy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; she said to the German mechanician;
        &ldquo;I want a few words with my husband.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The German would have left the room, but Levin said to him:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb yourself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The train is at three?&rdquo; queried the German. &ldquo;I
        mustn&rsquo;t be late.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin did not answer him, but walked out himself with his wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what have you to say to me?&rdquo; he said to her in
        French.
      </p>

      <p>
        He did not look her in the face, and did not care to see that she in her
        condition was trembling all over, and had a piteous, crushed look.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I ... I want to say that we can&rsquo;t go on like this; that
        this is misery....&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The servants are here at the sideboard,&rdquo; he said angrily;
        &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make a scene.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go in here!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        They were standing in the passage. Kitty would have gone into the next
        room, but there the English governess was giving Tanya a lesson.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, come into the garden.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        In the garden they came upon a peasant weeding the path. And no longer
        considering that the peasant could see her tear-stained and his agitated
        face, that they looked like people fleeing from some disaster, they went
        on with rapid steps, feeling that they must speak out and clear up
        misunderstandings, must be alone together, and so get rid of the misery
        they were both feeling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go on like this! It&rsquo;s misery! I am wretched;
        you are wretched. What for?&rdquo; she said, when they had at last
        reached a solitary garden seat at a turn in the lime tree avenue.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But tell me one thing: was there in his tone anything unseemly,
        not nice, humiliatingly horrible?&rdquo; he said, standing before her
        again in the same position with his clenched fists on his chest, as he
        had stood before her that night.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said in a shaking voice; &ldquo;but, Kostya,
        surely you see I&rsquo;m not to blame? All the morning I&rsquo;ve been
        trying to take a tone ... but such people.... Why did he come? How happy
        we were!&rdquo; she said, breathless with the sobs that shook her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although nothing had been pursuing them, and there was nothing to run
        away from, and they could not possibly have found anything very
        delightful on that garden seat, the gardener saw with astonishment that
        they passed him on their way home with comforted and radiant faces.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 15</h3>

      <p>
        After escorting his wife upstairs, Levin went to Dolly&rsquo;s part of
        the house. Darya Alexandrovna, for her part, was in great distress too
        that day. She was walking about the room, talking angrily to a little
        girl, who stood in the corner roaring.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And you shall stand all day in the corner, and have your dinner
        all alone, and not see one of your dolls, and I won&rsquo;t make you a
        new frock,&rdquo; she said, not knowing how to punish her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, she is a disgusting child!&rdquo; she turned to Levin.
        &ldquo;Where does she get such wicked propensities?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, what has she done?&rdquo; Levin said without much interest,
        for he had wanted to ask her advice, and so was annoyed that he had come
        at an unlucky moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Grisha and she went into the raspberries, and there ... I
        can&rsquo;t tell you really what she did. It&rsquo;s a thousand pities
        Miss Elliot&rsquo;s not with us. This one sees to
        nothing&mdash;she&rsquo;s a machine....
        <i>Figurez-vous que la petite</i>?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Darya Alexandrovna described Masha&rsquo;s crime.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That proves nothing; it&rsquo;s not a question of evil
        propensities at all, it&rsquo;s simply mischief,&rdquo; Levin assured
        her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you are upset about something? What have you come for?&rdquo;
        asked Dolly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on there?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And in the tone of her question Levin heard that it would be easy for
        him to say what he had meant to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not been in there, I&rsquo;ve been alone in the garden
        with Kitty. We&rsquo;ve had a quarrel for the second time since ...
        Stiva came.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly looked at him with her shrewd, comprehending eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, tell me, honor bright, has there been ... not in Kitty, but
        in that gentleman&rsquo;s behavior, a tone which might be
        unpleasant&mdash;not unpleasant, but horrible, offensive to a
        husband?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You mean, how shall I say.... Stay, stay in the corner!&rdquo;
        she said to Masha, who, detecting a faint smile in her mother&rsquo;s
        face, had been turning round. &ldquo;The opinion of the world would be
        that he is behaving as young men do behave.
        <i>Il fait la cour à une jeune et jolie femme</i>, and a husband
        who&rsquo;s a man of the world should only be flattered by it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Levin gloomily; &ldquo;but you noticed
        it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not only I, but Stiva noticed it. Just after breakfast he said to
        me in so many words,
        <i>Je crois que Veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour à Kitty</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right then; now I&rsquo;m satisfied.
        I&rsquo;ll send him away,&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you mean! Are you crazy?&rdquo; Dolly cried in horror;
        &ldquo;nonsense, Kostya, only think!&rdquo; she said, laughing.
        &ldquo;You can go now to Fanny,&rdquo; she said to Masha. &ldquo;No, if
        you wish it, I&rsquo;ll speak to Stiva. He&rsquo;ll take him away. He
        can say you&rsquo;re expecting visitors. Altogether he doesn&rsquo;t fit
        into the house.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;ll do it myself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll quarrel with him?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not a bit. I shall so enjoy it,&rdquo; Levin said, his eyes
        flashing with real enjoyment. &ldquo;Come, forgive her, Dolly, she
        won&rsquo;t do it again,&rdquo; he said of the little sinner, who had
        not gone to Fanny, but was standing irresolutely before her mother,
        waiting and looking up from under her brows to catch her mother&rsquo;s
        eye.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mother glanced at her. The child broke into sobs, hid her face on
        her mother&rsquo;s lap, and Dolly laid her thin, tender hand on her
        head.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And what is there in common between us and him?&rdquo; thought
        Levin, and he went off to look for Veslovsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he passed through the passage he gave orders for the carriage to be
        got ready to drive to the station.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The spring was broken yesterday,&rdquo; said the footman.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, the covered trap, then, and make haste. Where&rsquo;s the
        visitor?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The gentleman&rsquo;s gone to his room.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin came upon Veslovsky at the moment when the latter, having unpacked
        his things from his trunk, and laid out some new songs, was putting on
        his gaiters to go out riding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether there was something exceptional in Levin&rsquo;s face, or that
        Vassenka was himself conscious that <i>ce petit brin de cour</i> he was
        making was out of place in this family, but he was somewhat (as much as
        a young man in society can be) disconcerted at Levin&rsquo;s entrance.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You ride in gaiters?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s much cleaner,&rdquo; said Vassenka, putting his
        fat leg on a chair, fastening the bottom hook, and smiling with
        simple-hearted good humor.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was undoubtedly a good-natured fellow, and Levin felt sorry for him
        and ashamed of himself, as his host, when he saw the shy look on
        Vassenka&rsquo;s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the table lay a piece of stick which they had broken together that
        morning, trying their strength. Levin took the fragment in his hands and
        began smashing it up, breaking bits off the stick, not knowing how to
        begin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I wanted....&rdquo; He paused, but suddenly, remembering Kitty
        and everything that had happened, he said, looking him resolutely in the
        face: &ldquo;I have ordered the horses to be put-to for you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; Vassenka began in surprise. &ldquo;To drive
        where?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For you to drive to the station,&rdquo; Levin said gloomily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you going away, or has something happened?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It happens that I expect visitors,&rdquo; said Levin, his strong
        fingers more and more rapidly breaking off the ends of the split stick.
        &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not expecting visitors, and nothing has happened,
        but I beg you to go away. You can explain my rudeness as you
        like.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vassenka drew himself up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I beg you to explain....&rdquo; he said with dignity,
        understanding at last.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain,&rdquo; Levin said softly and deliberately,
        trying to control the trembling of his jaw; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;d
        better not ask.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And as the split ends were all broken off, Levin clutched the thick ends
        in his finger, broke the stick in two, and carefully caught the end as
        it fell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Probably the sight of those nervous fingers, of the muscles he had
        proved that morning at gymnastics, of the glittering eyes, the soft
        voice, and quivering jaws, convinced Vassenka better than any words. He
        bowed, shrugging his shoulders, and smiling contemptuously.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Can I not see Oblonsky?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The shrug and the smile did not irritate Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What else was there for him to do?&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send him to you at once.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What madness is this?&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch said when, after
        hearing from his friend that he was being turned out of the house, he
        found Levin in the garden, where he was walking about waiting for his
        guest&rsquo;s departure. &ldquo;<i>Mais c&rsquo;est ridicule!</i> What
        fly has stung you? <i>Mais c&rsquo;est du dernier ridicule!</i> What did
        you think, if a young man....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But the place where Levin had been stung was evidently still sore, for
        he turned pale again, when Stepan Arkadyevitch would have enlarged on
        the reason, and he himself cut him short.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t go into it! I can&rsquo;t help it. I feel
        ashamed of how I&rsquo;m treating you and him. But it won&rsquo;t be, I
        imagine, a great grief to him to go, and his presence was distasteful to
        me and to my wife.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s insulting to him!
        <i>Et puis c&rsquo;est ridicule</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And to me it&rsquo;s both insulting and distressing! And
        I&rsquo;m not at fault in any way, and there&rsquo;s no need for me to
        suffer.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, this I didn&rsquo;t expect of you!
        <i
          >On peut être jaloux, mais à ce point, c&rsquo;est du dernier
          ridicule!</i
        >&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin turned quickly, and walked away from him into the depths of the
        avenue, and he went on walking up and down alone. Soon he heard the
        rumble of the trap, and saw from behind the trees how Vassenka, sitting
        in the hay (unluckily there was no seat in the trap) in his Scotch cap,
        was driven along the avenue, jolting up and down over the ruts.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Levin thought, when a footman ran out
        of the house and stopped the trap. It was the mechanician, whom Levin
        had totally forgotten. The mechanician, bowing low, said something to
        Veslovsky, then clambered into the trap, and they drove off together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch and the princess were much upset by Levin&rsquo;s
        action. And he himself felt not only in the highest degree
        <i>ridicule</i>, but also utterly guilty and disgraced. But remembering
        what sufferings he and his wife had been through, when he asked himself
        how he should act another time, he answered that he should do just the
        same again.
      </p>

      <p>
        In spite of all this, towards the end of that day, everyone except the
        princess, who could not pardon Levin&rsquo;s action, became
        extraordinarily lively and good-humored, like children after a
        punishment or grown-up people after a dreary, ceremonious reception, so
        that by the evening Vassenka&rsquo;s dismissal was spoken of, in the
        absence of the princess, as though it were some remote event. And Dolly,
        who had inherited her father&rsquo;s gift of humorous storytelling, made
        Varenka helpless with laughter as she related for the third and fourth
        time, always with fresh humorous additions, how she had only just put on
        her new shoes for the benefit of the visitor, and on going into the
        drawing-room, heard suddenly the rumble of the trap. And who should be
        in the trap but Vassenka himself, with his Scotch cap, and his songs and
        his gaiters, and all, sitting in the hay.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If only you&rsquo;d ordered out the carriage! But no! and then I
        hear: &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; Oh, I thought they&rsquo;ve relented. I look
        out, and behold a fat German being sat down by him and driving away....
        And my new shoes all for nothing!...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 16</h3>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna carried out her intention and went to see Anna. She
        was sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything Levin disliked. She
        quite understood how right the Levins were in not wishing to have
        anything to do with Vronsky. But she felt she must go and see Anna, and
        show her that her feelings could not be changed, in spite of the change
        in her position. That she might be independent of the Levins in this
        expedition, Darya Alexandrovna sent to the village to hire horses for
        the drive; but Levin learning of it went to her to protest.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What makes you suppose that I dislike your going? But, even if I
        did dislike it, I should still more dislike your not taking my
        horses,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You never told me that you were going for
        certain. Hiring horses in the village is disagreeable to me, and,
        what&rsquo;s of more importance, they&rsquo;ll undertake the job and
        never get you there. I have horses. And if you don&rsquo;t want to wound
        me, you&rsquo;ll take mine.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna had to consent, and on the day fixed Levin had ready
        for his sister-in-law a set of four horses and relays, getting them
        together from the farm and saddle-horses&mdash;not at all a
        smart-looking set, but capable of taking Darya Alexandrovna the whole
        distance in a single day. At that moment, when horses were wanted for
        the princess, who was going, and for the midwife, it was a difficult
        matter for Levin to make up the number, but the duties of hospitality
        would not let him allow Darya Alexandrovna to hire horses when staying
        in his house. Moreover, he was well aware that the twenty roubles that
        would be asked for the journey were a serious matter for her; Darya
        Alexandrovna&rsquo;s pecuniary affairs, which were in a very
        unsatisfactory state, were taken to heart by the Levins as if they were
        their own.
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna, by Levin&rsquo;s advice, started before daybreak.
        The road was good, the carriage comfortable, the horses trotted along
        merrily, and on the box, besides the coachman, sat the counting-house
        clerk, whom Levin was sending instead of a groom for greater security.
        Darya Alexandrovna dozed and waked up only on reaching the inn where the
        horses were to be changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        After drinking tea at the same well-to-do peasant&rsquo;s with whom
        Levin had stayed on the way to Sviazhsky&rsquo;s, and chatting with the
        women about their children, and with the old man about Count Vronsky,
        whom the latter praised very highly, Darya Alexandrovna, at ten
        o&rsquo;clock, went on again. At home, looking after her children, she
        had no time to think. So now, after this journey of four hours, all the
        thoughts she had suppressed before rushed swarming into her brain, and
        she thought over all her life as she never had before, and from the most
        different points of view. Her thoughts seemed strange even to herself.
        At first she thought about the children, about whom she was uneasy,
        although the princess and Kitty (she reckoned more upon her) had
        promised to look after them. &ldquo;If only Masha does not begin her
        naughty tricks, if Grisha isn&rsquo;t kicked by a horse, and
        Lily&rsquo;s stomach isn&rsquo;t upset again!&rdquo; she thought. But
        these questions of the present were succeeded by questions of the
        immediate future. She began thinking how she had to get a new flat in
        Moscow for the coming winter, to renew the drawing-room furniture, and
        to make her elder girl a cloak. Then questions of the more remote future
        occurred to her: how she was to place her children in the world.
        &ldquo;The girls are all right,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;but the
        boys?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very well that I&rsquo;m teaching Grisha, but of
        course that&rsquo;s only because I am free myself now, I&rsquo;m not
        with child. Stiva, of course, there&rsquo;s no counting on. And with the
        help of good-natured friends I can bring them up; but if there&rsquo;s
        another baby coming?...&rdquo; And the thought struck her how untruly it
        was said that the curse laid on woman was that in sorrow she should
        bring forth children.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The birth itself, that&rsquo;s nothing; but the months of
        carrying the child&mdash;that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so
        intolerable,&rdquo; she thought, picturing to herself her last
        pregnancy, and the death of the last baby. And she recalled the
        conversation she had just had with the young woman at the inn. On being
        asked whether she had any children, the handsome young woman had
        answered cheerfully:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I had a girl baby, but God set me free; I buried her last
        Lent.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, did you grieve very much for her?&rdquo; asked Darya
        Alexandrovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why grieve? The old man has grandchildren enough as it is. It was
        only a trouble. No working, nor nothing. Only a tie.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This answer had struck Darya Alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the
        good-natured and pleasing face of the young woman; but now she could not
        help recalling these words. In those cynical words there was indeed a
        grain of truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, altogether,&rdquo; thought Darya Alexandrovna, looking back
        over her whole existence during those fifteen years of her married life,
        &ldquo;pregnancy, sickness, mental incapacity, indifference to
        everything, and most of all&mdash;hideousness. Kitty, young and pretty
        as she is, even Kitty has lost her looks; and I when I&rsquo;m with
        child become hideous, I know it. The birth, the agony, the hideous
        agonies, that last moment ... then the nursing, the sleepless nights,
        the fearful pains....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the pain from
        sore breasts which she had suffered with almost every child. &ldquo;Then
        the children&rsquo;s illnesses, that everlasting apprehension; then
        bringing them up; evil propensities&rdquo; (she thought of little
        Masha&rsquo;s crime among the raspberries), &ldquo;education,
        Latin&mdash;it&rsquo;s all so incomprehensible and difficult. And on the
        top of it all, the death of these children.&rdquo; And there rose again
        before her imagination the cruel memory, that always tore her
        mother&rsquo;s heart, of the death of her last little baby, who had died
        of croup; his funeral, the callous indifference of all at the little
        pink coffin, and her own torn heart, and her lonely anguish at the sight
        of the pale little brow with its projecting temples, and the open,
        wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it was
        being covered with the little pink lid with a cross braided on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And all this, what&rsquo;s it for? What is to come of it all?
        That I&rsquo;m wasting my life, never having a moment&rsquo;s peace,
        either with child, or nursing a child, forever irritable, peevish,
        wretched myself and worrying others, repulsive to my husband, while the
        children are growing up unhappy, badly educated, and penniless. Even
        now, if it weren&rsquo;t for spending the summer at the Levins&rsquo;, I
        don&rsquo;t know how we should be managing to live. Of course Kostya and
        Kitty have so much tact that we don&rsquo;t feel it; but it can&rsquo;t
        go on. They&rsquo;ll have children, they won&rsquo;t be able to keep us;
        it&rsquo;s a drag on them as it is. How is papa, who has hardly anything
        left for himself, to help us? So that I can&rsquo;t even bring the
        children up by myself, and may find it hard with the help of other
        people, at the cost of humiliation. Why, even if we suppose the greatest
        good luck, that the children don&rsquo;t die, and I bring them up
        somehow. At the very best they&rsquo;ll simply be decent people.
        That&rsquo;s all I can hope for. And to gain simply that&mdash;what
        agonies, what toil!... One&rsquo;s whole life ruined!&rdquo; Again she
        recalled what the young peasant woman had said, and again she was
        revolted at the thought; but she could not help admitting that there was
        a grain of brutal truth in the words.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it far now, Mihail?&rdquo; Darya Alexandrovna asked the
        counting-house clerk, to turn her mind from thoughts that were
        frightening her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;From this village, they say, it&rsquo;s five miles.&rdquo; The
        carriage drove along the village street and onto a bridge. On the bridge
        was a crowd of peasant women with coils of ties for the sheaves on their
        shoulders, gaily and noisily chattering. They stood still on the bridge,
        staring inquisitively at the carriage. All the faces turned to Darya
        Alexandrovna looked to her healthy and happy, making her envious of
        their enjoyment of life. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all living, they&rsquo;re
        all enjoying life,&rdquo; Darya Alexandrovna still mused when she had
        passed the peasant women and was driving uphill again at a trot, seated
        comfortably on the soft springs of the old carriage, &ldquo;while I, let
        out, as it were from prison, from the world of worries that fret me to
        death, am only looking about me now for an instant. They all live; those
        peasant women and my sister Natalia and Varenka and Anna, whom I am
        going to see&mdash;all, but not I.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And they attack Anna. What for? am I any better? I have, anyway,
        a husband I love&mdash;not as I should like to love him, still I do love
        him, while Anna never loved hers. How is she to blame? She wants to
        live. God has put that in our hearts. Very likely I should have done the
        same. Even to this day I don&rsquo;t feel sure I did right in listening
        to her at that terrible time when she came to me in Moscow. I ought then
        to have cast off my husband and have begun my life fresh. I might have
        loved and have been loved in reality. And is it any better as it is? I
        don&rsquo;t respect him. He&rsquo;s necessary to me,&rdquo; she thought
        about her husband, &ldquo;and I put up with him. Is that any better? At
        that time I could still have been admired, I had beauty left me
        still,&rdquo; Darya Alexandrovna pursued her thoughts, and she would
        have liked to look at herself in the looking-glass. She had a traveling
        looking-glass in her handbag, and she wanted to take it out; but looking
        at the backs of the coachman and the swaying counting-house clerk, she
        felt that she would be ashamed if either of them were to look round, and
        she did not take out the glass.
      </p>

      <p>
        But without looking in the glass, she thought that even now it was not
        too late; and she thought of Sergey Ivanovitch, who was always
        particularly attentive to her, of Stiva&rsquo;s good-hearted friend,
        Turovtsin, who had helped her nurse her children through the scarlatina,
        and was in love with her. And there was someone else, a quite young man,
        who&mdash;her husband had told her it as a joke&mdash;thought her more
        beautiful than either of her sisters. And the most passionate and
        impossible romances rose before Darya Alexandrovna&rsquo;s imagination.
        &ldquo;Anna did quite right, and certainly I shall never reproach her
        for it. She is happy, she makes another person happy, and she&rsquo;s
        not broken down as I am, but most likely just as she always was, bright,
        clever, open to every impression,&rdquo; thought Darya
        Alexandrovna,&mdash;and a sly smile curved her lips, for, as she
        pondered on Anna&rsquo;s love affair, Darya Alexandrovna constructed on
        parallel lines an almost identical love affair for herself, with an
        imaginary composite figure, the ideal man who was in love with her. She,
        like Anna, confessed the whole affair to her husband. And the amazement
        and perplexity of Stepan Arkadyevitch at this avowal made her smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        In such daydreams she reached the turning of the highroad that led to
        Vozdvizhenskoe.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 17</h3>

      <p>
        The coachman pulled up his four horses and looked round to the right, to
        a field of rye, where some peasants were sitting on a cart. The
        counting-house clerk was just going to jump down, but on second thoughts
        he shouted peremptorily to the peasants instead, and beckoned to them to
        come up. The wind, that seemed to blow as they drove, dropped when the
        carriage stood still; gadflies settled on the steaming horses that
        angrily shook them off. The metallic clank of a whetstone against a
        scythe, that came to them from the cart, ceased. One of the peasants got
        up and came towards the carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you are slow!&rdquo; the counting-house clerk shouted
        angrily to the peasant who was stepping slowly with his bare feet over
        the ruts of the rough dry road. &ldquo;Come along, do!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        A curly-headed old man with a bit of bast tied round his hair, and his
        bent back dark with perspiration, came towards the carriage, quickening
        his steps, and took hold of the mud-guard with his sunburnt hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Vozdvizhenskoe, the manor house? the count&rsquo;s?&rdquo; he
        repeated; &ldquo;go on to the end of this track. Then turn to the left.
        Straight along the avenue and you&rsquo;ll come right upon it. But whom
        do you want? The count himself?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, are they at home, my good man?&rdquo; Darya Alexandrovna
        said vaguely, not knowing how to ask about Anna, even of this peasant.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;At home for sure,&rdquo; said the peasant, shifting from one bare
        foot to the other, and leaving a distinct print of five toes and a heel
        in the dust. &ldquo;Sure to be at home,&rdquo; he repeated, evidently
        eager to talk. &ldquo;Only yesterday visitors arrived. There&rsquo;s a
        sight of visitors come. What do you want?&rdquo; He turned round and
        called to a lad, who was shouting something to him from the cart.
        &ldquo;Oh! They all rode by here not long since, to look at a reaping
        machine. They&rsquo;ll be home by now. And who will you be belonging
        to?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come a long way,&rdquo; said the coachman, climbing
        onto the box. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s not far?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you, it&rsquo;s just here. As soon as you get
        out....&rdquo; he said, keeping hold all the while of the carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        A healthy-looking, broad-shouldered young fellow came up too.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What, is it laborers they want for the harvest?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, my boy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you keep to the left, and you&rsquo;ll come right on
        it,&rdquo; said the peasant, unmistakably loth to let the travelers go,
        and eager to converse.
      </p>

      <p>
        The coachman started the horses, but they were only just turning off
        when the peasant shouted: &ldquo;Stop! Hi, friend! Stop!&rdquo; called
        the two voices. The coachman stopped.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming! They&rsquo;re yonder!&rdquo; shouted the
        peasant. &ldquo;See what a turn-out!&rdquo; he said, pointing to four
        persons on horseback, and two in a <i>char-à-banc</i>, coming along the
        road.
      </p>

      <p>
        They were Vronsky with a jockey, Veslovsky and Anna on horseback, and
        Princess Varvara and Sviazhsky in the <i>char-à-banc</i>. They had gone
        out to look at the working of a new reaping machine.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the carriage stopped, the party on horseback were coming at a
        walking pace. Anna was in front beside Veslovsky. Anna, quietly walking
        her horse, a sturdy English cob with cropped mane and short tail, her
        beautiful head with her black hair straying loose under her high hat,
        her full shoulders, her slender waist in her black riding habit, and all
        the ease and grace of her deportment, impressed Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the first minute it seemed to her unsuitable for Anna to be on
        horseback. The conception of riding on horseback for a lady was, in
        Darya Alexandrovna&rsquo;s mind, associated with ideas of youthful
        flirtation and frivolity, which, in her opinion, was unbecoming in
        Anna&rsquo;s position. But when she had scrutinized her, seeing her
        closer, she was at once reconciled to her riding. In spite of her
        elegance, everything was so simple, quiet, and dignified in the
        attitude, the dress and the movements of Anna, that nothing could have
        been more natural.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beside Anna, on a hot-looking gray cavalry horse, was Vassenka Veslovsky
        in his Scotch cap with floating ribbons, his stout legs stretched out in
        front, obviously pleased with his own appearance. Darya Alexandrovna
        could not suppress a good-humored smile as she recognized him. Behind
        rode Vronsky on a dark bay mare, obviously heated from galloping. He was
        holding her in, pulling at the reins.
      </p>

      <p>
        After him rode a little man in the dress of a jockey. Sviazhsky and
        Princess Varvara in a new <i>char-à-banc</i> with a big, raven-black
        trotting horse, overtook the party on horseback.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna&rsquo;s face suddenly beamed with a joyful smile at the instant
        when, in the little figure huddled in a corner of the old carriage, she
        recognized Dolly. She uttered a cry, started in the saddle, and set her
        horse into a gallop. On reaching the carriage she jumped off without
        assistance, and holding up her riding habit, she ran up to greet Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I thought it was you and dared not think it. How delightful! You
        can&rsquo;t fancy how glad I am!&rdquo; she said, at one moment pressing
        her face against Dolly and kissing her, and at the next holding her off
        and examining her with a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a delightful surprise, Alexey!&rdquo; she said,
        looking round at Vronsky, who had dismounted, and was walking towards
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky, taking off his tall gray hat, went up to Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how glad we are to see you,&rdquo; he
        said, giving peculiar significance to the words, and showing his strong
        white teeth in a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vassenka Veslovsky, without getting off his horse, took off his cap and
        greeted the visitor by gleefully waving the ribbons over his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Princess Varvara,&rdquo; Anna said in reply to a
        glance of inquiry from Dolly as the <i>char-à-banc</i> drove up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Darya Alexandrovna, and unconsciously her face
        betrayed her dissatisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Princess Varvara was her husband&rsquo;s aunt, and she had long known
        her, and did not respect her. She knew that Princess Varvara had passed
        her whole life toadying on her rich relations, but that she should now
        be sponging on Vronsky, a man who was nothing to her, mortified Dolly on
        account of her kinship with her husband. Anna noticed Dolly&rsquo;s
        expression, and was disconcerted by it. She blushed, dropped her riding
        habit, and stumbled over it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna went up to the <i>char-à-banc</i> and coldly greeted
        Princess Varvara. Sviazhsky too she knew. He inquired how his queer
        friend with the young wife was, and running his eyes over the
        ill-matched horses and the carriage with its patched mud-guards,
        proposed to the ladies that they should get into the <i>char-à-banc</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll get into this vehicle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
        horse is quiet, and the princess drives capitally.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, stay as you were,&rdquo; said Anna, coming up, &ldquo;and
        we&rsquo;ll go in the carriage,&rdquo; and taking Dolly&rsquo;s arm, she
        drew her away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna&rsquo;s eyes were fairly dazzled by the elegant
        carriage of a pattern she had never seen before, the splendid horses,
        and the elegant and gorgeous people surrounding her. But what struck her
        most of all was the change that had taken place in Anna, whom she knew
        so well and loved. Any other woman, a less close observer, not knowing
        Anna before, or not having thought as Darya Alexandrovna had been
        thinking on the road, would not have noticed anything special in Anna.
        But now Dolly was struck by that temporary beauty, which is only found
        in women during the moments of love, and which she saw now in
        Anna&rsquo;s face. Everything in her face, the clearly marked dimples in
        her cheeks and chin, the line of her lips, the smile which, as it were,
        fluttered about her face, the brilliance of her eyes, the grace and
        rapidity of her movements, the fulness of the notes of her voice, even
        the manner in which, with a sort of angry friendliness, she answered
        Veslovsky when he asked permission to get on her cob, so as to teach it
        to gallop with the right leg foremost&mdash;it was all peculiarly
        fascinating, and it seemed as if she were herself aware of it, and
        rejoicing in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        When both the women were seated in the carriage, a sudden embarrassment
        came over both of them. Anna was disconcerted by the intent look of
        inquiry Dolly fixed upon her. Dolly was embarrassed because after
        Sviazhsky&rsquo;s phrase about &ldquo;this vehicle,&rdquo; she could not
        help feeling ashamed of the dirty old carriage in which Anna was sitting
        with her. The coachman Philip and the counting-house clerk were
        experiencing the same sensation. The counting-house clerk, to conceal
        his confusion, busied himself settling the ladies, but Philip the
        coachman became sullen, and was bracing himself not to be overawed in
        future by this external superiority. He smiled ironically, looking at
        the raven horse, and was already deciding in his own mind that this
        smart trotter in the <i>char-à-banc</i> was only good for
        <i>promenage</i>, and wouldn&rsquo;t do thirty miles straight off in the
        heat.
      </p>

      <p>
        The peasants had all got up from the cart and were inquisitively and
        mirthfully staring at the meeting of the friends, making their comments
        on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They&rsquo;re pleased, too; haven&rsquo;t seen each other for a
        long while,&rdquo; said the curly-headed old man with the bast round his
        hair.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I say, Uncle Gerasim, if we could take that raven horse now, to
        cart the corn, that &rsquo;ud be quick work!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Look-ee! Is that a woman in breeches?&rdquo; said one of them,
        pointing to Vassenka Veslovsky sitting in a side saddle.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay, a man! See how smartly he&rsquo;s going it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Eh, lads! seems we&rsquo;re not going to sleep, then?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What chance of sleep today!&rdquo; said the old man, with a
        sidelong look at the sun. &ldquo;Midday&rsquo;s past, look-ee! Get your
        hooks, and come along!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 18</h3>

      <p>
        Anna looked at Dolly&rsquo;s thin, care-worn face, with its wrinkles
        filled with dust from the road, and she was on the point of saying what
        she was thinking, that is, that Dolly had got thinner. But, conscious
        that she herself had grown handsomer, and that Dolly&rsquo;s eyes were
        telling her so, she sighed and began to speak about herself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are looking at me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and wondering how
        I can be happy in my position? Well! it&rsquo;s shameful to confess, but
        I ... I&rsquo;m inexcusably happy. Something magical has happened to me,
        like a dream, when you&rsquo;re frightened, panic-stricken, and all of a
        sudden you wake up and all the horrors are no more. I have waked up. I
        have lived through the misery, the dread, and now for a long while past,
        especially since we&rsquo;ve been here, I&rsquo;ve been so
        happy!...&rdquo; she said, with a timid smile of inquiry looking at
        Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How glad I am!&rdquo; said Dolly smiling, involuntarily speaking
        more coldly than she wanted to. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad for you. Why
        haven&rsquo;t you written to me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why?... Because I hadn&rsquo;t the courage.... You forget my
        position....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To me? Hadn&rsquo;t the courage? If you knew how I ... I look
        at....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna wanted to express her thoughts of the morning, but
        for some reason it seemed to her now out of place to do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But of that we&rsquo;ll talk later. What&rsquo;s this, what are
        all these buildings?&rdquo; she asked, wanting to change the
        conversation and pointing to the red and green roofs that came into view
        behind the green hedges of acacia and lilac. &ldquo;Quite a little
        town.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But Anna did not answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no! How do you look at my position, what do you think of
        it?&rdquo; she asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I consider....&rdquo; Darya Alexandrovna was beginning, but at
        that instant Vassenka Veslovsky, having brought the cob to gallop with
        the right leg foremost, galloped past them, bumping heavily up and down
        in his short jacket on the chamois leather of the side saddle.
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing it, Anna Arkadyevna!&rdquo; he shouted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna did not even glance at him; but again it seemed to Darya
        Alexandrovna out of place to enter upon such a long conversation in the
        carriage, and so she cut short her thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I
        always loved you, and if one loves anyone, one loves the whole person,
        just as they are and not as one would like them to be....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna, taking her eyes off her friend&rsquo;s face and dropping her
        eyelids (this was a new habit Dolly had not seen in her before),
        pondered, trying to penetrate the full significance of the words. And
        obviously interpreting them as she would have wished, she glanced at
        Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you had any sins,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they would all be
        forgiven you for your coming to see me and these words.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Dolly saw that tears stood in her eyes. She pressed Anna&rsquo;s
        hand in silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what are these buildings? How many there are of
        them!&rdquo; After a moment&rsquo;s silence she repeated her question.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;These are the servants&rsquo; houses, barns, and stables,&rdquo;
        answered Anna. &ldquo;And there the park begins. It had all gone to
        ruin, but Alexey had everything renewed. He is very fond of this place,
        and, what I never expected, he has become intensely interested in
        looking after it. But his is such a rich nature! Whatever he takes up,
        he does splendidly. So far from being bored by it, he works with
        passionate interest. He&mdash;with his temperament as I know it&mdash;he
        has become careful and businesslike, a first-rate manager, he positively
        reckons every penny in his management of the land. But only in that.
        When it&rsquo;s a question of tens of thousands, he doesn&rsquo;t think
        of money.&rdquo; She spoke with that gleefully sly smile with which
        women often talk of the secret characteristics only known to
        them&mdash;of those they love. &ldquo;Do you see that big building?
        that&rsquo;s the new hospital. I believe it will cost over a hundred
        thousand; that&rsquo;s his hobby just now. And do you know how it all
        came about? The peasants asked him for some meadowland, I think it was,
        at a cheaper rate, and he refused, and I accused him of being miserly.
        Of course it was not really because of that, but everything together, he
        began this hospital to prove, do you see, that he was not miserly about
        money. <i>C&rsquo;est une petitesse</i>, if you like, but I love him all
        the more for it. And now you&rsquo;ll see the house in a moment. It was
        his grandfather&rsquo;s house, and he has had nothing changed
        outside.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How beautiful!&rdquo; said Dolly, looking with involuntary
        admiration at the handsome house with columns, standing out among the
        different-colored greens of the old trees in the garden.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it fine? And from the house, from the top, the view
        is wonderful.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        They drove into a courtyard strewn with gravel and bright with flowers,
        in which two laborers were at work putting an edging of stones round the
        light mould of a flower bed, and drew up in a covered entry.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, they&rsquo;re here already!&rdquo; said Anna, looking at the
        saddle horses, which were just being led away from the steps. &ldquo;It
        is a nice horse, isn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s my cob; my favorite. Lead
        him here and bring me some sugar. Where is the count?&rdquo; she
        inquired of two smart footmen who darted out. &ldquo;Ah, there he
        is!&rdquo; she said, seeing Vronsky coming to meet her with Veslovsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where are you going to put the princess?&rdquo; said Vronsky in
        French, addressing Anna, and without waiting for a reply, he once more
        greeted Darya Alexandrovna, and this time he kissed her hand. &ldquo;I
        think the big balcony room.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, that&rsquo;s too far off! Better in the corner room, we
        shall see each other more. Come, let&rsquo;s go up,&rdquo; said Anna, as
        she gave her favorite horse the sugar the footman had brought her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Et vous oubliez votre devoir</i>,&rdquo; she said to
        Veslovsky, who came out too on the steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Pardon, j&rsquo;en ai tout plein les poches</i>,&rdquo; he
        answered, smiling, putting his fingers in his waistcoat pocket.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Mais vous venez trop tard</i>,&rdquo; she said, rubbing her
        handkerchief on her hand, which the horse had made wet in taking the
        sugar.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna turned to Dolly. &ldquo;You can stay some time? For one day only?
        That&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I promised to be back, and the children....&rdquo; said Dolly,
        feeling embarrassed both because she had to get her bag out of the
        carriage, and because she knew her face must be covered with dust.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, Dolly, darling!... Well, we&rsquo;ll see. Come along, come
        along!&rdquo; and Anna led Dolly to her room.
      </p>

      <p>
        That room was not the smart guest chamber Vronsky had suggested, but the
        one of which Anna had said that Dolly would excuse it. And this room,
        for which excuse was needed, was more full of luxury than any in which
        Dolly had ever stayed, a luxury that reminded her of the best hotels
        abroad.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, darling, how happy I am!&rdquo; Anna said, sitting down in
        her riding habit for a moment beside Dolly. &ldquo;Tell me about all of
        you. Stiva I had only a glimpse of, and he cannot tell one about the
        children. How is my favorite, Tanya? Quite a big girl, I expect?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s very tall,&rdquo; Darya Alexandrovna answered
        shortly, surprised herself that she should respond so coolly about her
        children. &ldquo;We are having a delightful stay at the
        Levins&rsquo;,&rdquo; she added.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, if I had known,&rdquo; said Anna, &ldquo;that you do not
        despise me!... You might have all come to us. Stiva&rsquo;s an old
        friend and a great friend of Alexey&rsquo;s, you know,&rdquo; she added,
        and suddenly she blushed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but we are all....&rdquo; Dolly answered in confusion.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But in my delight I&rsquo;m talking nonsense. The one thing,
        darling, is that I am so glad to have you!&rdquo; said Anna, kissing her
        again. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me yet how and what you think about
        me, and I keep wanting to know. But I&rsquo;m glad you will see me as I
        am. The chief thing I shouldn&rsquo;t like would be for people to
        imagine I want to prove anything. I don&rsquo;t want to prove anything;
        I merely want to live, to do no one harm but myself. I have the right to
        do that, haven&rsquo;t I? But it is a big subject, and we&rsquo;ll talk
        over everything properly later. Now I&rsquo;ll go and dress and send a
        maid to you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 19</h3>

      <p>
        Left alone, Darya Alexandrovna, with a good housewife&rsquo;s eye,
        scanned her room. All she had seen in entering the house and walking
        through it, and all she saw now in her room, gave her an impression of
        wealth and sumptuousness and of that modern European luxury of which she
        had only read in English novels, but had never seen in Russia and in the
        country. Everything was new from the new French hangings on the walls to
        the carpet which covered the whole floor. The bed had a spring mattress,
        and a special sort of bolster and silk pillowcases on the little
        pillows. The marble washstand, the dressing table, the little sofa, the
        tables, the bronze clock on the chimney piece, the window curtains, and
        the <i>portières</i> were all new and expensive.
      </p>

      <p>
        The smart maid, who came in to offer her services, with her hair done up
        high, and a gown more fashionable than Dolly&rsquo;s, was as new and
        expensive as the whole room. Darya Alexandrovna liked her neatness, her
        deferential and obliging manners, but she felt ill at ease with her. She
        felt ashamed of her seeing the patched dressing jacket that had
        unluckily been packed by mistake for her. She was ashamed of the very
        patches and darned places of which she had been so proud at home. At
        home it had been so clear that for six dressing jackets there would be
        needed twenty-four yards of nainsook at sixteen pence the yard, which
        was a matter of thirty shillings besides the cutting-out and making, and
        these thirty shillings had been saved. But before the maid she felt, if
        not exactly ashamed, at least uncomfortable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna had a great sense of relief when Annushka, whom she
        had known for years, walked in. The smart maid was sent for to go to her
        mistress, and Annushka remained with Darya Alexandrovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        Annushka was obviously much pleased at that lady&rsquo;s arrival, and
        began to chatter away without a pause. Dolly observed that she was
        longing to express her opinion in regard to her mistress&rsquo;s
        position, especially as to the love and devotion of the count to Anna
        Arkadyevna, but Dolly carefully interrupted her whenever she began to
        speak about this.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I grew up with Anna Arkadyevna; my lady&rsquo;s dearer to me than
        anything. Well, it&rsquo;s not for us to judge. And, to be sure, there
        seems so much love....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kindly pour out the water for me to wash now, please,&rdquo;
        Darya Alexandrovna cut her short.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly. We&rsquo;ve two women kept specially for washing small
        things, but most of the linen&rsquo;s done by machinery. The count goes
        into everything himself. Ah, what a husband!...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly was glad when Anna came in, and by her entrance put a stop to
        Annushka&rsquo;s gossip.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna had put on a very simple batiste gown. Dolly scrutinized that
        simple gown attentively. She knew what it meant, and the price at which
        such simplicity was obtained.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;An old friend,&rdquo; said Anna of Annushka.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna was not embarrassed now. She was perfectly composed and at ease.
        Dolly saw that she had now completely recovered from the impression her
        arrival had made on her, and had assumed that superficial, careless tone
        which, as it were, closed the door on that compartment in which her
        deeper feelings and ideas were kept.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, Anna, and how is your little girl?&rdquo; asked Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Annie?&rdquo; (This was what she called her little daughter
        Anna.) &ldquo;Very well. She has got on wonderfully. Would you like to
        see her? Come, I&rsquo;ll show her to you. We had a terrible
        bother,&rdquo; she began telling her, &ldquo;over nurses. We had an
        Italian wet-nurse. A good creature, but so stupid! We wanted to get rid
        of her, but the baby is so used to her that we&rsquo;ve gone on keeping
        her still.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But how have you managed?...&rdquo; Dolly was beginning a
        question as to what name the little girl would have; but noticing a
        sudden frown on Anna&rsquo;s face, she changed the drift of her
        question.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How did you manage? have you weaned her yet?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But Anna had understood.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mean to ask that? You meant to ask about her
        surname. Yes? That worries Alexey. She has no name&mdash;that is,
        she&rsquo;s a Karenina,&rdquo; said Anna, dropping her eyelids till
        nothing could be seen but the eyelashes meeting. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll
        talk about all that later,&rdquo; her face suddenly brightening.
        &ldquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll show you her. <i>Elle est très gentille</i>. She
        crawls now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        In the nursery the luxury which had impressed Dolly in the whole house
        struck her still more. There were little go-carts ordered from England,
        and appliances for learning to walk, and a sofa after the fashion of a
        billiard table, purposely constructed for crawling, and swings and
        baths, all of special pattern, and modern. They were all English, solid,
        and of good make, and obviously very expensive. The room was large, and
        very light and lofty.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they went in, the baby, with nothing on but her little smock, was
        sitting in a little elbow chair at the table, having her dinner of
        broth, which she was spilling all over her little chest. The baby was
        being fed, and the Russian nursery maid was evidently sharing her meal.
        Neither the wet-nurse nor the head-nurse were there; they were in the
        next room, from which came the sound of their conversation in the queer
        French which was their only means of communication.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hearing Anna&rsquo;s voice, a smart, tall, English nurse with a
        disagreeable face and a dissolute expression walked in at the door,
        hurriedly shaking her fair curls, and immediately began to defend
        herself though Anna had not found fault with her. At every word Anna
        said, the English nurse said hurriedly several times, &ldquo;Yes, my
        lady.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The rosy baby with her black eyebrows and hair, her sturdy red little
        body with tight goose-flesh skin, delighted Darya Alexandrovna in spite
        of the cross expression with which she stared at the stranger. She
        positively envied the baby&rsquo;s healthy appearance. She was
        delighted, too, at the baby&rsquo;s crawling. Not one of her own
        children had crawled like that. When the baby was put on the carpet and
        its little dress tucked up behind, it was wonderfully charming. Looking
        round like some little wild animal at the grown-up big people with her
        bright black eyes, she smiled, unmistakably pleased at their admiring
        her, and holding her legs sideways, she pressed vigorously on her arms,
        and rapidly drew her whole back up after, and then made another step
        forward with her little arms.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the whole atmosphere of the nursery, and especially the English
        nurse, Darya Alexandrovna did not like at all. It was only on the
        supposition that no good nurse would have entered so irregular a
        household as Anna&rsquo;s that Darya Alexandrovna could explain to
        herself how Anna with her insight into people could take such an
        unprepossessing, disreputable-looking woman as nurse to her child.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides, from a few words that were dropped, Darya Alexandrovna saw at
        once that Anna, the two nurses, and the child had no common existence,
        and that the mother&rsquo;s visit was something exceptional. Anna wanted
        to get the baby her plaything, and could not find it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most amazing of all was the fact that on being asked how many teeth the
        baby had, Anna answered wrong, and knew nothing about the two last
        teeth.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I sometimes feel sorry I&rsquo;m so superfluous here,&rdquo; said
        Anna, going out of the nursery and holding up her skirt so as to escape
        the plaything standing in the doorway. &ldquo;It was very different with
        my first child.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I expected it to be the other way,&rdquo; said Darya Alexandrovna
        shyly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no! By the way, do you know I saw Seryozha?&rdquo; said Anna,
        screwing up her eyes, as though looking at something far away.
        &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll talk about that later. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe
        it, I&rsquo;m like a hungry beggar woman when a full dinner is set
        before her, and she does not know what to begin on first. The dinner is
        you, and the talks I have before me with you, which I could never have
        with anyone else; and I don&rsquo;t know which subject to begin upon
        first. <i>Mais je ne vous ferai grâce de rien</i>. I must have
        everything out with you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I ought to give you a sketch of the company you will meet
        with us,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll begin with the ladies.
        Princess Varvara&mdash;you know her, and I know your opinion and
        Stiva&rsquo;s about her. Stiva says the whole aim of her existence is to
        prove her superiority over Auntie Katerina Pavlovna: that&rsquo;s all
        true; but she&rsquo;s a good-natured woman, and I am so grateful to her.
        In Petersburg there was a moment when a chaperon was absolutely
        essential for me. Then she turned up. But really she is good-natured.
        She did a great deal to alleviate my position. I see you don&rsquo;t
        understand all the difficulty of my position ... there in
        Petersburg,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Here I&rsquo;m perfectly at ease
        and happy. Well, of that later on, though. Then
        Sviazhsky&mdash;he&rsquo;s the marshal of the district, and he&rsquo;s a
        very good sort of a man, but he wants to get something out of Alexey.
        You understand, with his property, now that we are settled in the
        country, Alexey can exercise great influence. Then there&rsquo;s
        Tushkevitch&mdash;you have seen him, you know&mdash;Betsy&rsquo;s
        admirer. Now he&rsquo;s been thrown over and he&rsquo;s come to see us.
        As Alexey says, he&rsquo;s one of those people who are very pleasant if
        one accepts them for what they try to appear to be,
        <i>et puis il est comme il faut</i>, as Princess Varvara says. Then
        Veslovsky ... you know him. A very nice boy,&rdquo; she said, and a sly
        smile curved her lips. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this wild story about him and
        the Levins? Veslovsky told Alexey about it, and we don&rsquo;t believe
        it. <i>Il est très gentil et naïf</i>,&rdquo; she said again with the
        same smile. &ldquo;Men need occupation, and Alexey needs a circle, so I
        value all these people. We have to have the house lively and gay, so
        that Alexey may not long for any novelty. Then you&rsquo;ll see the
        steward&mdash;a German, a very good fellow, and he understands his work.
        Alexey has a very high opinion of him. Then the doctor, a young man, not
        quite a Nihilist perhaps, but you know, eats with his knife ... but a
        very good doctor. Then the architect.... <i>Une petite cour!</i>&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 20</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Dolly for you, princess, you were so anxious to see
        her,&rdquo; said Anna, coming out with Darya Alexandrovna onto the stone
        terrace where Princess Varvara was sitting in the shade at an embroidery
        frame, working at a cover for Count Alexey Kirillovitch&rsquo;s easy
        chair. &ldquo;She says she doesn&rsquo;t want anything before dinner,
        but please order some lunch for her, and I&rsquo;ll go and look for
        Alexey and bring them all in.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Princess Varvara gave Dolly a cordial and rather patronizing reception,
        and began at once explaining to her that she was living with Anna
        because she had always cared more for her than her sister Katerina
        Pavlovna, the aunt that had brought Anna up, and that now, when everyone
        had abandoned Anna, she thought it her duty to help her in this most
        difficult period of transition.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Her husband will give her a divorce, and then I shall go back to
        my solitude; but now I can be of use, and I am doing my duty, however
        difficult it may be for me&mdash;not like some other people. And how
        sweet it is of you, how right of you to have come! They live like the
        best of married couples; it&rsquo;s for God to judge them, not for us.
        And didn&rsquo;t Biryuzovsky and Madame Avenieva ... and Sam Nikandrov,
        and Vassiliev and Madame Mamonova, and Liza Neptunova.... Did no one say
        anything about them? And it has ended by their being received by
        everyone. And then,
        <i
          >c&rsquo;est un intérieur si joli, si comme il faut. Tout-à-fait à
          l&rsquo;anglaise. On se réunit le matin au breakfast, et puis on se
          sépare.</i
        >
        Everyone does as he pleases till dinner time. Dinner at seven
        o&rsquo;clock. Stiva did very rightly to send you. He needs their
        support. You know that through his mother and brother he can do
        anything. And then they do so much good. He didn&rsquo;t tell you about
        his hospital? <i>Ce sera admirable</i>&mdash;everything from
        Paris.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Their conversation was interrupted by Anna, who had found the men of the
        party in the billiard room, and returned with them to the terrace. There
        was still a long time before the dinner-hour, it was exquisite weather,
        and so several different methods of spending the next two hours were
        proposed. There were very many methods of passing the time at
        Vozdvizhenskoe, and these were all unlike those in use at Pokrovskoe.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Une partie de lawn-tennis,</i>&rdquo; Veslovsky proposed, with
        his handsome smile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be partners again, Anna
        Arkadyevna.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s too hot; better stroll about the garden and have a
        row in the boat, show Darya Alexandrovna the river banks.&rdquo; Vronsky
        proposed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I agree to anything,&rdquo; said Sviazhsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I imagine that what Dolly would like best would be a
        stroll&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t you? And then the boat, perhaps,&rdquo; said
        Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        So it was decided. Veslovsky and Tushkevitch went off to the bathing
        place, promising to get the boat ready and to wait there for them.
      </p>

      <p>
        They walked along the path in two couples, Anna with Sviazhsky, and
        Dolly with Vronsky. Dolly was a little embarrassed and anxious in the
        new surroundings in which she found herself. Abstractly, theoretically,
        she did not merely justify, she positively approved of Anna&rsquo;s
        conduct. As is indeed not unfrequent with women of unimpeachable virtue,
        weary of the monotony of respectable existence, at a distance she not
        only excused illicit love, she positively envied it. Besides, she loved
        Anna with all her heart. But seeing Anna in actual life among these
        strangers, with this fashionable tone that was so new to Darya
        Alexandrovna, she felt ill at ease. What she disliked particularly was
        seeing Princess Varvara ready to overlook everything for the sake of the
        comforts she enjoyed.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a general principle, abstractly, Dolly approved of Anna&rsquo;s
        action; but to see the man for whose sake her action had been taken was
        disagreeable to her. Moreover, she had never liked Vronsky. She thought
        him very proud, and saw nothing in him of which he could be proud except
        his wealth. But against her own will, here in his own house, he overawed
        her more than ever, and she could not be at ease with him. She felt with
        him the same feeling she had had with the maid about her dressing
        jacket. Just as with the maid she had felt not exactly ashamed, but
        embarrassed at her darns, so she felt with him not exactly ashamed, but
        embarrassed at herself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly was ill at ease, and tried to find a subject of conversation. Even
        though she supposed that, through his pride, praise of his house and
        garden would be sure to be disagreeable to him, she did all the same
        tell him how much she liked his house.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a very fine building, and in the good
        old-fashioned style,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I like so much the court in front of the steps. Was that always
        so?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; he said, and his face beamed with pleasure.
        &ldquo;If you could only have seen that court last spring!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he began, at first rather diffidently, but more and more carried
        away by the subject as he went on, to draw her attention to the various
        details of the decoration of his house and garden. It was evident that,
        having devoted a great deal of trouble to improve and beautify his home,
        Vronsky felt a need to show off the improvements to a new person, and
        was genuinely delighted at Darya Alexandrovna&rsquo;s praise.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you would care to look at the hospital, and are not tired,
        indeed, it&rsquo;s not far. Shall we go?&rdquo; he said, glancing into
        her face to convince himself that she was not bored. &ldquo;Are you
        coming, Anna?&rdquo; he turned to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We will come, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; she said, addressing
        Sviazhsky. &ldquo;<i
          >Mais il ne faut pas laisser le pauvre Veslovsky et Tushkevitch se
          morfondre là dans le bateau.</i
        >
        We must send and tell them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, this is a monument he is setting up here,&rdquo; said Anna,
        turning to Dolly with that sly smile of comprehension with which she had
        previously talked about the hospital.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a work of real importance!&rdquo; said Sviazhsky.
        But to show he was not trying to ingratiate himself with Vronsky, he
        promptly added some slightly critical remarks.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I wonder, though, count,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that while you do
        so much for the health of the peasants, you take so little interest in
        the schools.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est devenu tellement commun les écoles,</i>&rdquo;
        said Vronsky. &ldquo;You understand it&rsquo;s not on that account, but
        it just happens so, my interest has been diverted elsewhere. This way
        then to the hospital,&rdquo; he said to Darya Alexandrovna, pointing to
        a turning out of the avenue.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ladies put up their parasols and turned into the side path. After
        going down several turnings, and going through a little gate, Darya
        Alexandrovna saw standing on rising ground before her a large
        pretentious-looking red building, almost finished. The iron roof, which
        was not yet painted, shone with dazzling brightness in the sunshine.
        Beside the finished building another had been begun, surrounded by
        scaffolding. Workmen in aprons, standing on scaffolds, were laying
        bricks, pouring mortar out of vats, and smoothing it with trowels.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How quickly work gets done with you!&rdquo; said Sviazhsky.
        &ldquo;When I was here last time the roof was not on.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;By the autumn it will all be ready. Inside almost everything is
        done,&rdquo; said Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s this new building?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the house for the doctor and the dispensary,&rdquo;
        answered Vronsky, seeing the architect in a short jacket coming towards
        him; and excusing himself to the ladies, he went to meet him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going round a hole where the workmen were slaking lime, he stood still
        with the architect and began talking rather warmly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The front is still too low,&rdquo; he said to Anna, who had asked
        what was the matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I said the foundation ought to be raised,&rdquo; said Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, of course it would have been much better, Anna
        Arkadyevna,&rdquo; said the architect, &ldquo;but now it&rsquo;s too
        late.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I take a great interest in it,&rdquo; Anna answered
        Sviazhsky, who was expressing his surprise at her knowledge of
        architecture. &ldquo;This new building ought to have been in harmony
        with the hospital. It was an afterthought, and was begun without a
        plan.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky, having finished his talk with the architect, joined the ladies,
        and led them inside the hospital.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although they were still at work on the cornices outside and were
        painting on the ground floor, upstairs almost all the rooms were
        finished. Going up the broad cast-iron staircase to the landing, they
        walked into the first large room. The walls were stuccoed to look like
        marble, the huge plate-glass windows were already in, only the parquet
        floor was not yet finished, and the carpenters, who were planing a block
        of it, left their work, taking off the bands that fastened their hair,
        to greet the gentry.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This is the reception room,&rdquo; said Vronsky. &ldquo;Here
        there will be a desk, tables, and benches, and nothing more.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This way; let us go in here. Don&rsquo;t go near the
        window,&rdquo; said Anna, trying the paint to see if it were dry.
        &ldquo;Alexey, the paint&rsquo;s dry already,&rdquo; she added.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the reception room they went into the corridor. Here Vronsky showed
        them the mechanism for ventilation on a novel system. Then he showed
        them marble baths, and beds with extraordinary springs. Then he showed
        them the wards one after another, the storeroom, the linen room, then
        the heating stove of a new pattern, then the trolleys, which would make
        no noise as they carried everything needed along the corridors, and many
        other things. Sviazhsky, as a connoisseur in the latest mechanical
        improvements, appreciated everything fully. Dolly simply wondered at all
        she had not seen before, and, anxious to understand it all, made minute
        inquiries about everything, which gave Vronsky great satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I imagine that this will be the solitary example of a
        properly fitted hospital in Russia,&rdquo; said Sviazhsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And won&rsquo;t you have a lying-in ward?&rdquo; asked Dolly.
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so much needed in the country. I have
        often....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        In spite of his usual courtesy, Vronsky interrupted her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This is not a lying-in home, but a hospital for the sick, and is
        intended for all diseases, except infectious complaints,&rdquo; he said.
        &ldquo;Ah! look at this,&rdquo; and he rolled up to Darya Alexandrovna
        an invalid chair that had just been ordered for the convalescents.
        &ldquo;Look.&rdquo; He sat down in the chair and began moving it.
        &ldquo;The patient can&rsquo;t walk&mdash;still too weak, perhaps, or
        something wrong with his legs, but he must have air, and he moves, rolls
        himself along....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna was interested by everything. She liked everything
        very much, but most of all she liked Vronsky himself with his natural,
        simple-hearted eagerness. &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s a very nice, good
        man,&rdquo; she thought several times, not hearing what he said, but
        looking at him and penetrating into his expression, while she mentally
        put herself in Anna&rsquo;s place. She liked him so much just now with
        his eager interest that she saw how Anna could be in love with him.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 21</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I think the princess is tired, and horses don&rsquo;t
        interest her,&rdquo; Vronsky said to Anna, who wanted to go on to the
        stables, where Sviazhsky wished to see the new stallion. &ldquo;You go
        on, while I escort the princess home, and we&rsquo;ll have a little
        talk,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you would like that?&rdquo; he added,
        turning to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know nothing about horses, and I shall be delighted,&rdquo;
        answered Darya Alexandrovna, rather astonished.
      </p>

      <p>
        She saw by Vronsky&rsquo;s face that he wanted something from her. She
        was not mistaken. As soon as they had passed through the little gate
        back into the garden, he looked in the direction Anna had taken, and
        having made sure that she could neither hear nor see them, he began:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You guess that I have something I want to say to you,&rdquo; he
        said, looking at her with laughing eyes. &ldquo;I am not wrong in
        believing you to be a friend of Anna&rsquo;s.&rdquo; He took off his
        hat, and taking out his handkerchief, wiped his head, which was growing
        bald.
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna made no answer, and merely stared at him with dismay.
        When she was left alone with him, she suddenly felt afraid; his laughing
        eyes and stern expression scared her.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most diverse suppositions as to what he was about to speak of to her
        flashed into her brain. &ldquo;He is going to beg me to come to stay
        with them with the children, and I shall have to refuse; or to create a
        set that will receive Anna in Moscow.... Or isn&rsquo;t it Vassenka
        Veslovsky and his relations with Anna? Or perhaps about Kitty, that he
        feels he was to blame?&rdquo; All her conjectures were unpleasant, but
        she did not guess what he really wanted to talk about to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You have so much influence with Anna, she is so fond of
        you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;do help me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna looked with timid inquiry into his energetic face,
        which under the lime-trees was continually being lighted up in patches
        by the sunshine, and then passing into complete shadow again. She waited
        for him to say more, but he walked in silence beside her, scratching
        with his cane in the gravel.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You have come to see us, you, the only woman of Anna&rsquo;s
        former friends&mdash;I don&rsquo;t count Princess Varvara&mdash;but I
        know that you have done this not because you regard our position as
        normal, but because, understanding all the difficulty of the position,
        you still love her and want to be a help to her. Have I understood you
        rightly?&rdquo; he asked, looking round at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered Darya Alexandrovna, putting down her
        sunshade, &ldquo;but....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he broke in, and unconsciously, oblivious of the
        awkward position into which he was putting his companion, he stopped
        abruptly, so that she had to stop short too. &ldquo;No one feels more
        deeply and intensely than I do all the difficulty of Anna&rsquo;s
        position; and that you may well understand, if you do me the honor of
        supposing I have any heart. I am to blame for that position, and that is
        why I feel it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Darya Alexandrovna, involuntarily
        admiring the sincerity and firmness with which he said this. &ldquo;But
        just because you feel yourself responsible, you exaggerate it, I am
        afraid,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Her position in the world is difficult,
        I can well understand.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In the world it is hell!&rdquo; he brought out quickly, frowning
        darkly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t imagine moral sufferings greater than
        what she went through in Petersburg in that fortnight ... and I beg you
        to believe it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but here, so long as neither Anna ... nor you miss
        society....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Society!&rdquo; he said contemptuously, &ldquo;how could I miss
        society?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So far&mdash;and it may be so always&mdash;you are happy and at
        peace. I see in Anna that she is happy, perfectly happy, she has had
        time to tell me so much already,&rdquo; said Darya Alexandrovna,
        smiling; and involuntarily, as she said this, at the same moment a doubt
        entered her mind whether Anna really were happy.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Vronsky, it appeared, had no doubts on that score.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know that she has revived
        after all her sufferings; she is happy. She is happy in the present. But
        I?... I am afraid of what is before us ... I beg your pardon, you would
        like to walk on?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, let us sit here.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna sat down on a garden seat in a corner of the avenue.
        He stood up facing her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I see that she is happy,&rdquo; he repeated, and the doubt
        whether she were happy sank more deeply into Darya Alexandrovna&rsquo;s
        mind. &ldquo;But can it last? Whether we have acted rightly or wrongly
        is another question, but the die is cast,&rdquo; he said, passing from
        Russian to French, &ldquo;and we are bound together for life. We are
        united by all the ties of love that we hold most sacred. We have a
        child, we may have other children. But the law and all the conditions of
        our position are such that thousands of complications arise which she
        does not see and does not want to see. And that one can well understand.
        But I can&rsquo;t help seeing them. My daughter is by law not my
        daughter, but Karenin&rsquo;s. I cannot bear this falsity!&rdquo; he
        said, with a vigorous gesture of refusal, and he looked with gloomy
        inquiry towards Darya Alexandrovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        She made no answer, but simply gazed at him. He went on:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;One day a son may be born, my son, and he will be legally a
        Karenin; he will not be the heir of my name nor of my property, and
        however happy we may be in our home life and however many children we
        may have, there will be no real tie between us. They will be Karenins.
        You can understand the bitterness and horror of this position! I have
        tried to speak of this to Anna. It irritates her. She does not
        understand, and to her I cannot speak plainly of all this. Now look at
        another side. I am happy, happy in her love, but I must have occupation.
        I have found occupation, and am proud of what I am doing and consider it
        nobler than the pursuits of my former companions at court and in the
        army. And most certainly I would not change the work I am doing for
        theirs. I am working here, settled in my own place, and I am happy and
        contented, and we need nothing more to make us happy. I love my work
        here. <i>Ce n&rsquo;est pas un pis-aller,</i> on the contrary....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna noticed that at this point in his explanation he grew
        confused, and she did not quite understand this digression, but she felt
        that having once begun to speak of matters near his heart, of which he
        could not speak to Anna, he was now making a clean breast of everything,
        and that the question of his pursuits in the country fell into the same
        category of matters near his heart, as the question of his relations
        with Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I will go on,&rdquo; he said, collecting himself.
        &ldquo;The great thing is that as I work I want to have a conviction
        that what I am doing will not die with me, that I shall have heirs to
        come after me,&mdash;and this I have not. Conceive the position of a man
        who knows that his children, the children of the woman he loves, will
        not be his, but will belong to someone who hates them and cares nothing
        about them! It is awful!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He paused, evidently much moved.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, indeed, I see that. But what can Anna do?&rdquo; queried
        Darya Alexandrovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that brings me to the object of my conversation,&rdquo; he
        said, calming himself with an effort. &ldquo;Anna can, it depends on
        her.... Even to petition the Tsar for legitimization, a divorce is
        essential. And that depends on Anna. Her husband agreed to a
        divorce&mdash;at that time your husband had arranged it completely. And
        now, I know, he would not refuse it. It is only a matter of writing to
        him. He said plainly at that time that if she expressed the desire, he
        would not refuse. Of course,&rdquo; he said gloomily, &ldquo;it is one
        of those Pharisaical cruelties of which only such heartless men are
        capable. He knows what agony any recollection of him must give her, and
        knowing her, he must have a letter from her. I can understand that it is
        agony to her. But the matter is of such importance, that one must
        <i
          >passer par-dessus toutes ces finesses de sentiment. Il y va du
          bonheur et de l&rsquo;existence d&rsquo;Anne et de ses enfants.</i
        >
        I won&rsquo;t speak of myself, though it&rsquo;s hard for me, very
        hard,&rdquo; he said, with an expression as though he were threatening
        someone for its being hard for him. &ldquo;And so it is, princess, that
        I am shamelessly clutching at you as an anchor of salvation. Help me to
        persuade her to write to him and ask for a divorce.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; Darya Alexandrovna said dreamily, as she
        vividly recalled her last interview with Alexey Alexandrovitch.
        &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; she repeated with decision, thinking of
        Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Use your influence with her, make her write. I don&rsquo;t
        like&mdash;I&rsquo;m almost unable to speak about this to her.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, I will talk to her. But how is it she does not think
        of it herself?&rdquo; said Darya Alexandrovna, and for some reason she
        suddenly at that point recalled Anna&rsquo;s strange new habit of
        half-closing her eyes. And she remembered that Anna drooped her eyelids
        just when the deeper questions of life were touched upon. &ldquo;Just as
        though she half-shut her eyes to her own life, so as not to see
        everything,&rdquo; thought Dolly. &ldquo;Yes, indeed, for my own sake
        and for hers I will talk to her,&rdquo; Dolly said in reply to his look
        of gratitude.
      </p>

      <p>
        They got up and walked to the house.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 22</h3>

      <p>
        When Anna found Dolly at home before her, she looked intently in her
        eyes, as though questioning her about the talk she had had with Vronsky,
        but she made no inquiry in words.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s dinner time,&rdquo; she said.
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve not seen each other at all yet. I am reckoning on the
        evening. Now I want to go and dress. I expect you do too; we all got
        splashed at the buildings.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly went to her room and she felt amused. To change her dress was
        impossible, for she had already put on her best dress. But in order to
        signify in some way her preparation for dinner, she asked the maid to
        brush her dress, changed her cuffs and tie, and put some lace on her
        head.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This is all I can do,&rdquo; she said with a smile to Anna, who
        came in to her in a third dress, again of extreme simplicity.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, we are too formal here,&rdquo; she said, as it were
        apologizing for her magnificence. &ldquo;Alexey is delighted at your
        visit, as he rarely is at anything. He has completely lost his heart to
        you,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not tired?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        There was no time for talking about anything before dinner. Going into
        the drawing-room they found Princess Varvara already there, and the
        gentlemen of the party in black frock-coats. The architect wore a
        swallow-tail coat. Vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his
        guest. The architect he had already introduced to her at the hospital.
      </p>

      <p>
        A stout butler, resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin and a
        starched white cravat, announced that dinner was ready, and the ladies
        got up. Vronsky asked Sviazhsky to take in Anna Arkadyevna, and himself
        offered his arm to Dolly. Veslovsky was before Tushkevitch in offering
        his arm to Princess Varvara, so that Tushkevitch with the steward and
        the doctor walked in alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dinner, the dining-room, the service, the waiting at table, the
        wine, and the food, were not simply in keeping with the general tone of
        modern luxury throughout all the house, but seemed even more sumptuous
        and modern. Darya Alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to
        her, and as a good housekeeper used to managing a
        household&mdash;although she never dreamed of adapting anything she saw
        to her own household, as it was all in a style of luxury far above her
        own manner of living&mdash;she could not help scrutinizing every detail,
        and wondering how and by whom it was all done. Vassenka Veslovsky, her
        husband, and even Sviazhsky, and many other people she knew, would never
        have considered this question, and would have readily believed what
        every well-bred host tries to make his guests feel, that is, that all
        that is well-ordered in his house has cost him, the host, no trouble
        whatever, but comes of itself. Darya Alexandrovna was well aware that
        even porridge for the children&rsquo;s breakfast does not come of
        itself, and that therefore, where so complicated and magnificent a style
        of luxury was maintained, someone must give earnest attention to its
        organization. And from the glance with which Alexey Kirillovitch scanned
        the table, from the way he nodded to the butler, and offered Darya
        Alexandrovna her choice between cold soup and hot soup, she saw that it
        was all organized and maintained by the care of the master of the house
        himself. It was evident that it all rested no more upon Anna than upon
        Veslovsky. She, Sviazhsky, the princess, and Veslovsky, were equally
        guests, with light hearts enjoying what had been arranged for them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation. The
        conversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small
        table with persons present, like the steward and the architect,
        belonging to a completely different world, struggling not to be overawed
        by an elegance to which they were unaccustomed, and unable to sustain a
        large share in the general conversation. But this difficult conversation
        Anna directed with her usual tact and naturalness, and indeed she did so
        with actual enjoyment, as Darya Alexandrovna observed. The conversation
        began about the row Tushkevitch and Veslovsky had taken alone together
        in the boat, and Tushkevitch began describing the last boat races in
        Petersburg at the Yacht Club. But Anna, seizing the first pause, at once
        turned to the architect to draw him out of his silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nikolay Ivanitch was struck,&rdquo; she said, meaning Sviazhsky,
        &ldquo;at the progress the new building had made since he was here last;
        but I am there every day, and every day I wonder at the rate at which it
        grows.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s first-rate working with his excellency,&rdquo; said
        the architect with a smile (he was respectful and composed, though with
        a sense of his own dignity). &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very different matter
        to have to do with the district authorities. Where one would have to
        write out sheaves of papers, here I call upon the count, and in three
        words we settle the business.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The American way of doing business,&rdquo; said Sviazhsky, with a
        smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, there they build in a rational fashion....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the United
        States, but Anna quickly brought it round to another topic, so as to
        draw the steward into talk.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you ever seen a reaping machine?&rdquo; she said, addressing
        Darya Alexandrovna. &ldquo;We had just ridden over to look at one when
        we met. It&rsquo;s the first time I ever saw one.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How do they work?&rdquo; asked Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Exactly like little scissors. A plank and a lot of little
        scissors. Like this.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands covered with
        rings, and began showing how the machine worked. It was clear that she
        saw nothing would be understood from her explanation; but aware that her
        talk was pleasant and her hands beautiful she went on explaining.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;More like little penknives,&rdquo; Veslovsky said playfully,
        never taking his eyes off her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna gave a just perceptible smile, but made no answer.
        &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it true, Karl Fedoritch, that it&rsquo;s just like
        little scissors?&rdquo; she said to the steward.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Oh, ja,</i>&rdquo; answered the German.
        <i>&ldquo;Es ist ein ganz einfaches Ding,&rdquo;</i> and he began to
        explain the construction of the machine.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity it doesn&rsquo;t bind too. I saw one at the
        Vienna exhibition, which binds with a wire,&rdquo; said Sviazhsky.
        &ldquo;They would be more profitable in use.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        <i
          >&ldquo;Es kommt drauf an.... Der Preis vom Draht muss ausgerechnet
          werden.&rdquo;</i
        >
        And the German, roused from his taciturnity, turned to Vronsky.
        <i>&ldquo;Das lässt sich ausrechnen, Erlaucht.&rdquo;</i> The German was
        just feeling in the pocket where were his pencil and the notebook he
        always wrote in, but recollecting that he was at a dinner, and observing
        Vronsky&rsquo;s chilly glance, he checked himself.
        <i>&ldquo;Zu compliziert, macht zu viel Klopot,&rdquo;</i> he concluded.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>&ldquo;Wünscht man Dochots, so hat man auch Klopots,&rdquo;</i> said
        Vassenka Veslovsky, mimicking the German.
        <i>&ldquo;J&rsquo;adore l&rsquo;allemand,&rdquo;</i> he addressed Anna
        again with the same smile.
      </p>

      <p><i>&ldquo;Cessez,&rdquo;</i> she said with playful severity.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We expected to find you in the fields, Vassily Semyonitch,&rdquo;
        she said to the doctor, a sickly-looking man; &ldquo;have you been
        there?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I went there, but I had taken flight,&rdquo; the doctor answered
        with gloomy jocoseness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve taken a good constitutional?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and how was the old woman? I hope it&rsquo;s not
        typhus?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Typhus it is not, but it&rsquo;s taking a bad turn.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; said Anna, and having thus paid the dues of
        civility to her domestic circle, she turned to her own friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It would be a hard task, though, to construct a machine from your
        description, Anna Arkadyevna,&rdquo; Sviazhsky said jestingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, why so?&rdquo; said Anna with a smile that betrayed that
        she knew there was something charming in her disquisitions upon the
        machine that had been noticed by Sviazhsky. This new trait of girlish
        coquettishness made an unpleasant impression on Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But Anna Arkadyevna&rsquo;s knowledge of architecture is
        marvelous,&rdquo; said Tushkevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To be sure, I heard Anna Arkadyevna talking yesterday about
        plinths and damp-courses,&rdquo; said Veslovsky. &ldquo;Have I got it
        right?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing marvelous about it, when one sees and hears
        so much of it,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;But, I dare say, you don&rsquo;t
        even know what houses are made of?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna saw that Anna disliked the tone of raillery that
        existed between her and Veslovsky, but fell in with it against her will.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from Levin. He obviously
        attached no significance to Veslovsky&rsquo;s chattering; on the
        contrary, he encouraged his jests.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come now, tell us, Veslovsky, how are the stones held
        together?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;By cement, of course.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Bravo! And what is cement?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, some sort of paste ... no, putty,&rdquo; said Veslovsky,
        raising a general laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        The company at dinner, with the exception of the doctor, the architect,
        and the steward, who remained plunged in gloomy silence, kept up a
        conversation that never paused, glancing off one subject, fastening on
        another, and at times stinging one or the other to the quick. Once Darya
        Alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick, and got so hot that she
        positively flushed and wondered afterwards whether she had said anything
        extreme or unpleasant. Sviazhsky began talking of Levin, describing his
        strange view that machinery is simply pernicious in its effects on
        Russian agriculture.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have not the pleasure of knowing this M. Levin,&rdquo; Vronsky
        said, smiling, &ldquo;but most likely he has never seen the machines he
        condemns; or if he has seen and tried any, it must have been after a
        queer fashion, some Russian imitation, not a machine from abroad. What
        sort of views can anyone have on such a subject?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Turkish views, in general,&rdquo; Veslovsky said, turning to Anna
        with a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t defend his opinions,&rdquo; Darya Alexandrovna
        said, firing up; &ldquo;but I can say that he&rsquo;s a highly
        cultivated man, and if he were here he would know very well how to
        answer you, though I am not capable of doing so.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I like him extremely, and we are great friends,&rdquo; Sviazhsky
        said, smiling good-naturedly. &ldquo;<i
          >Mais pardon, il est un petit peu toqué;</i
        >
        he maintains, for instance, that district councils and arbitration
        boards are all of no use, and he is unwilling to take part in
        anything.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our Russian apathy,&rdquo; said Vronsky, pouring water
        from an iced decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem;
        &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve no sense of the duties our privileges impose upon us,
        and so we refuse to recognize these duties.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know no man more strict in the performance of his
        duties,&rdquo; said Darya Alexandrovna, irritated by Vronsky&rsquo;s
        tone of superiority.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; pursued Vronsky, who was evidently for some
        reason or other keenly affected by this conversation, &ldquo;such as I
        am, I am, on the contrary, extremely grateful for the honor they have
        done me, thanks to Nikolay Ivanitch&rdquo; (he indicated Sviazhsky),
        &ldquo;in electing me a justice of the peace. I consider that for me the
        duty of being present at the session, of judging some peasants&rsquo;
        quarrel about a horse, is as important as anything I can do. And I shall
        regard it as an honor if they elect me for the district council.
        It&rsquo;s only in that way I can pay for the advantages I enjoy as a
        landowner. Unluckily they don&rsquo;t understand the weight that the big
        landowners ought to have in the state.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        It was strange to Darya Alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he
        was of being right at his own table. She thought how Levin, who believed
        the opposite, was just as positive in his opinions at his own table. But
        she loved Levin, and so she was on his side.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So we can reckon upon you, count, for the coming
        elections?&rdquo; said Sviazhsky. &ldquo;But you must come a little
        beforehand, so as to be on the spot by the eighth. If you would do me
        the honor to stop with me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I rather agree with your <i>beau-frère</i>,&rdquo; said Anna,
        &ldquo;though not quite on the same ground as he,&rdquo; she added with
        a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that we have too many of these public
        duties in these latter days. Just as in old days there were so many
        government functionaries that one had to call in a functionary for every
        single thing, so now everyone&rsquo;s doing some sort of public duty.
        Alexey has been here now six months, and he&rsquo;s a member, I do
        believe, of five or six different public bodies.
        <i>Du train que cela va,</i> the whole time will be wasted on it. And
        I&rsquo;m afraid that with such a multiplicity of these bodies,
        they&rsquo;ll end in being a mere form. How many are you a member of,
        Nikolay Ivanitch?&rdquo; she turned to Sviazhsky&mdash;&ldquo;over
        twenty, I fancy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna spoke lightly, but irritation could be discerned in her tone. Darya
        Alexandrovna, watching Anna and Vronsky attentively, detected it
        instantly. She noticed, too, that as she spoke Vronsky&rsquo;s face had
        immediately taken a serious and obstinate expression. Noticing this, and
        that Princess Varvara at once made haste to change the conversation by
        talking of Petersburg acquaintances, and remembering what Vronsky had
        without apparent connection said in the garden of his work in the
        country, Dolly surmised that this question of public activity was
        connected with some deep private disagreement between Anna and Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dinner, the wine, the decoration of the table were all very good;
        but it was all like what Darya Alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners
        and balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her; it all
        had the same impersonal and constrained character, and so on an ordinary
        day and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable impression
        on her.
      </p>

      <p>
        After dinner they sat on the terrace, then they proceeded to play lawn
        tennis. The players, divided into two parties, stood on opposite sides
        of a tightly drawn net with gilt poles on the carefully leveled and
        rolled croquet-ground. Darya Alexandrovna made an attempt to play, but
        it was a long time before she could understand the game, and by the time
        she did understand it, she was so tired that she sat down with Princess
        Varvara and simply looked on at the players. Her partner, Tushkevitch,
        gave up playing too, but the others kept the game up for a long time.
        Sviazhsky and Vronsky both played very well and seriously. They kept a
        sharp lookout on the balls served to them, and without haste or getting
        in each other&rsquo;s way, they ran adroitly up to them, waited for the
        rebound, and neatly and accurately returned them over the net. Veslovsky
        played worse than the others. He was too eager, but he kept the players
        lively with his high spirits. His laughter and outcries never paused.
        Like the other men of the party, with the ladies&rsquo; permission, he
        took off his coat, and his solid, comely figure in his white
        shirt-sleeves, with his red perspiring face and his impulsive movements,
        made a picture that imprinted itself vividly on the memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Darya Alexandrovna lay in bed that night, as soon as she closed her
        eyes, she saw Vassenka Veslovsky flying about the croquet ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the game Darya Alexandrovna was not enjoying herself. She did not
        like the light tone of raillery that was kept up all the time between
        Vassenka Veslovsky and Anna, and the unnaturalness altogether of
        grown-up people, all alone without children, playing at a child&rsquo;s
        game. But to avoid breaking up the party and to get through the time
        somehow, after a rest she joined the game again, and pretended to be
        enjoying it. All that day it seemed to her as though she were acting in
        a theater with actors cleverer than she, and that her bad acting was
        spoiling the whole performance. She had come with the intention of
        staying two days, if all went well. But in the evening, during the game,
        she made up her mind that she would go home next day. The maternal cares
        and worries, which she had so hated on the way, now, after a day spent
        without them, struck her in quite another light, and tempted her back to
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        When, after evening tea and a row by night in the boat, Darya
        Alexandrovna went alone to her room, took off her dress, and began
        arranging her thin hair for the night, she had a great sense of relief.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was positively disagreeable to her to think that Anna was coming to
        see her immediately. She longed to be alone with her own thoughts.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 23</h3>

      <p>
        Dolly was wanting to go to bed when Anna came in to see her, attired for
        the night. In the course of the day Anna had several times begun to
        speak of matters near her heart, and every time after a few words she
        had stopped: &ldquo;Afterwards, by ourselves, we&rsquo;ll talk about
        everything. I&rsquo;ve got so much I want to tell you,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now they were by themselves, and Anna did not know what to talk about.
        She sat in the window looking at Dolly, and going over in her own mind
        all the stores of intimate talk which had seemed so inexhaustible
        beforehand, and she found nothing. At that moment it seemed to her that
        everything had been said already.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what of Kitty?&rdquo; she said with a heavy sigh, looking
        penitently at Dolly. &ldquo;Tell me the truth, Dolly: isn&rsquo;t she
        angry with me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Angry? Oh, no!&rdquo; said Darya Alexandrovna, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But she hates me, despises me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no! But you know that sort of thing isn&rsquo;t
        forgiven.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Anna, turning away and looking out of the
        open window. &ldquo;But I was not to blame. And who is to blame?
        What&rsquo;s the meaning of being to blame? Could it have been
        otherwise? What do you think? Could it possibly have happened that you
        didn&rsquo;t become the wife of Stiva?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t know. But this is what I want you to tell
        me....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, but we&rsquo;ve not finished about Kitty. Is she happy?
        He&rsquo;s a very nice man, they say.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s much more than very nice. I don&rsquo;t know a better
        man.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, how glad I am! I&rsquo;m so glad! Much more than very
        nice,&rdquo; she repeated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But tell me about yourself. We&rsquo;ve a great deal to talk
        about. And I&rsquo;ve had a talk with....&rdquo; Dolly did not know what
        to call him. She felt it awkward to call him either the count or Alexey
        Kirillovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;With Alexey,&rdquo; said Anna, &ldquo;I know what you talked
        about. But I wanted to ask you directly what you think of me, of my
        life?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How am I to say like that straight off? I really don&rsquo;t
        know.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, tell me all the same.... You see my life. But you
        mustn&rsquo;t forget that you&rsquo;re seeing us in the summer, when you
        have come to us and we are not alone.... But we came here early in the
        spring, lived quite alone, and shall be alone again, and I desire
        nothing better. But imagine me living alone without him, alone, and that
        will be ... I see by everything that it will often be repeated, that he
        will be half the time away from home,&rdquo; she said, getting up and
        sitting down close by Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she interrupted Dolly, who would have answered,
        &ldquo;of course I won&rsquo;t try to keep him by force. I don&rsquo;t
        keep him indeed. The races are just coming, his horses are running, he
        will go. I&rsquo;m very glad. But think of me, fancy my position.... But
        what&rsquo;s the use of talking about it?&rdquo; She smiled.
        &ldquo;Well, what did he talk about with you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He spoke of what I want to speak about of myself, and it&rsquo;s
        easy for me to be his advocate; of whether there is not a possibility
        ... whether you could not....&rdquo; (Darya Alexandrovna hesitated)
        &ldquo;correct, improve your position.... You know how I look at it....
        But all the same, if possible, you should get married....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Divorce, you mean?&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;Do you know, the only
        woman who came to see me in Petersburg was Betsy Tverskaya? You know
        her, of course?
        <i>Au fond, c&rsquo;est la femme la plus depravée qui existe.</i> She
        had an intrigue with Tushkevitch, deceiving her husband in the basest
        way. And she told me that she did not care to know me so long as my
        position was irregular. Don&rsquo;t imagine I would compare ... I know
        you, darling. But I could not help remembering.... Well, so what did he
        say to you?&rdquo; she repeated.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He said that he was unhappy on your account and his own. Perhaps
        you will say that it&rsquo;s egoism, but what a legitimate and noble
        egoism. He wants first of all to legitimize his daughter, and to be your
        husband, to have a legal right to you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What wife, what slave can be so utterly a slave as I, in my
        position?&rdquo; she put in gloomily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The chief thing he desires ... he desires that you should not
        suffer.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible. Well?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and the most legitimate desire&mdash;he wishes that your
        children should have a name.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What children?&rdquo; Anna said, not looking at Dolly, and half
        closing her eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Annie and those to come....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He need not trouble on that score; I shall have no more
        children.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How can you tell that you won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall not, because I don&rsquo;t wish it.&rdquo; And, in spite
        of all her emotion, Anna smiled, as she caught the naïve expression of
        curiosity, wonder, and horror on Dolly&rsquo;s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The doctor told me after my illness....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; said Dolly, opening her eyes wide.
      </p>

      <p>
        For her this was one of those discoveries the consequences and
        deductions from which are so immense that all that one feels for the
        first instant is that it is impossible to take it all in, and that one
        will have to reflect a great, great deal upon it.
      </p>

      <p>
        This discovery, suddenly throwing light on all those families of one or
        two children, which had hitherto been so incomprehensible to her,
        aroused so many ideas, reflections, and contradictory emotions, that she
        had nothing to say, and simply gazed with wide-open eyes of wonder at
        Anna. This was the very thing she had been dreaming of, but now learning
        that it was possible, she was horrified. She felt that it was too simple
        a solution of too complicated a problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>&ldquo;N&rsquo;est-ce pas immoral?&rdquo;</i> was all she said, after
        a brief pause.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so? Think, I have a choice between two alternatives: either
        to be with child, that is an invalid, or to be the friend and companion
        of my husband&mdash;practically my husband,&rdquo; Anna said in a tone
        intentionally superficial and frivolous.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Darya Alexandrovna, hearing the very
        arguments she had used to herself, and not finding the same force in
        them as before.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For you, for other people,&rdquo; said Anna, as though divining
        her thoughts, &ldquo;there may be reason to hesitate; but for me.... You
        must consider, I am not his wife; he loves me as long as he loves me.
        And how am I to keep his love? Not like this!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She moved her white hands in a curve before her waist with extraordinary
        rapidity, as happens during moments of excitement; ideas and memories
        rushed into Darya Alexandrovna&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;I,&rdquo; she
        thought, &ldquo;did not keep my attraction for Stiva; he left me for
        others, and the first woman for whom he betrayed me did not keep him by
        being always pretty and lively. He deserted her and took another. And
        can Anna attract and keep Count Vronsky in that way? If that is what he
        looks for, he will find dresses and manners still more attractive and
        charming. And however white and beautiful her bare arms are, however
        beautiful her full figure and her eager face under her black curls, he
        will find something better still, just as my disgusting, pitiful, and
        charming husband does.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly made no answer, she merely sighed. Anna noticed this sigh,
        indicating dissent, and she went on. In her armory she had other
        arguments so strong that no answer could be made to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you say that it&rsquo;s not right? But you must
        consider,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;you forget my position. How can I
        desire children? I&rsquo;m not speaking of the suffering, I&rsquo;m not
        afraid of that. Think only, what are my children to be? Ill-fated
        children, who will have to bear a stranger&rsquo;s name. For the very
        fact of their birth they will be forced to be ashamed of their mother,
        their father, their birth.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But that is just why a divorce is necessary.&rdquo; But Anna did
        not hear her. She longed to give utterance to all the arguments with
        which she had so many times convinced herself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is reason given me for, if I am not to use it to avoid
        bringing unhappy beings into the world!&rdquo; She looked at Dolly, but
        without waiting for a reply she went on:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I should always feel I had wronged these unhappy children,&rdquo;
        she said. &ldquo;If they are not, at any rate they are not unhappy;
        while if they are unhappy, I alone should be to blame for it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        These were the very arguments Darya Alexandrovna had used in her own
        reflections; but she heard them without understanding them. &ldquo;How
        can one wrong creatures that don&rsquo;t exist?&rdquo; she thought. And
        all at once the idea struck her: could it possibly, under any
        circumstances, have been better for her favorite Grisha if he had never
        existed? And this seemed to her so wild, so strange, that she shook her
        head to drive away this tangle of whirling, mad ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know; it&rsquo;s not right,&rdquo; was all she
        said, with an expression of disgust on her face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but you mustn&rsquo;t forget that you and I.... And besides
        that,&rdquo; added Anna, in spite of the wealth of her arguments and the
        poverty of Dolly&rsquo;s objections, seeming still to admit that it was
        not right, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget the chief point, that I am not now
        in the same position as you. For you the question is: do you desire not
        to have any more children; while for me it is: do I desire to have them?
        And that&rsquo;s a great difference. You must see that I can&rsquo;t
        desire it in my position.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna made no reply. She suddenly felt that she had got far
        away from Anna; that there lay between them a barrier of questions on
        which they could never agree, and about which it was better not to
        speak.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 24</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then there is all the more reason for you to legalize your
        position, if possible,&rdquo; said Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, if possible,&rdquo; said Anna, speaking all at once in an
        utterly different tone, subdued and mournful.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t mean a divorce is impossible? I was told
        your husband had consented to it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Dolly, I don&rsquo;t want to talk about that.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, we won&rsquo;t then,&rdquo; Darya Alexandrovna hastened to
        say, noticing the expression of suffering on Anna&rsquo;s face.
        &ldquo;All I see is that you take too gloomy a view of things.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I? Not at all! I&rsquo;m always bright and happy. You see,
        <i>je fais des passions.</i> Veslovsky....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, to tell the truth, I don&rsquo;t like Veslovsky&rsquo;s
        tone,&rdquo; said Darya Alexandrovna, anxious to change the subject.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nonsense! It amuses Alexey, and that&rsquo;s
        all; but he&rsquo;s a boy, and quite under my control. You know, I turn
        him as I please. It&rsquo;s just as it might be with your Grisha....
        Dolly!&rdquo;&mdash;she suddenly changed the subject&mdash;&ldquo;you
        say I take too gloomy a view of things. You can&rsquo;t understand.
        It&rsquo;s too awful! I try not to take any view of it at all.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I think you ought to. You ought to do all you can.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what can I do? Nothing. You tell me to marry Alexey, and say
        I don&rsquo;t think about it. I don&rsquo;t think about it!&rdquo; she
        repeated, and a flush rose into her face. She got up, straightening her
        chest, and sighed heavily. With her light step she began pacing up and
        down the room, stopping now and then. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think of it?
        Not a day, not an hour passes that I don&rsquo;t think of it, and blame
        myself for thinking of it ... because thinking of that may drive me mad.
        Drive me mad!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;When I think of it, I
        can&rsquo;t sleep without morphine. But never mind. Let us talk quietly.
        They tell me, divorce. In the first place, he won&rsquo;t give me a
        divorce. He&rsquo;s under the influence of Countess Lidia Ivanovna
        now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna, sitting erect on a chair, turned her head, following
        Anna with a face of sympathetic suffering.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You ought to make the attempt,&rdquo; she said softly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Suppose I make the attempt. What does it mean?&rdquo; she said,
        evidently giving utterance to a thought, a thousand times thought over
        and learned by heart. &ldquo;It means that I, hating him, but still
        recognizing that I have wronged him&mdash;and I consider him
        magnanimous&mdash;that I humiliate myself to write to him.... Well,
        suppose I make the effort; I do it. Either I receive a humiliating
        refusal or consent.... Well, I have received his consent, say....&rdquo;
        Anna was at that moment at the furthest end of the room, and she stopped
        there, doing something to the curtain at the window. &ldquo;I receive
        his consent, but my ... my son? They won&rsquo;t give him up to me. He
        will grow up despising me, with his father, whom I&rsquo;ve abandoned.
        Do you see, I love ... equally, I think, but both more than
        myself&mdash;two creatures, Seryozha and Alexey.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She came out into the middle of the room and stood facing Dolly, with
        her arms pressed tightly across her chest. In her white dressing gown
        her figure seemed more than usually grand and broad. She bent her head,
        and with shining, wet eyes looked from under her brows at Dolly, a thin
        little pitiful figure in her patched dressing jacket and nightcap,
        shaking all over with emotion.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It is only those two creatures that I love, and one excludes the
        other. I can&rsquo;t have them together, and that&rsquo;s the only thing
        I want. And since I can&rsquo;t have that, I don&rsquo;t care about the
        rest. I don&rsquo;t care about anything, anything. And it will end one
        way or another, and so I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t like to talk of it.
        So don&rsquo;t blame me, don&rsquo;t judge me for anything. You
        can&rsquo;t with your pure heart understand all that I&rsquo;m
        suffering.&rdquo; She went up, sat down beside Dolly, and with a guilty
        look, peeped into her face and took her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What are you thinking? What are you thinking about me?
        Don&rsquo;t despise me. I don&rsquo;t deserve contempt. I&rsquo;m simply
        unhappy. If anyone is unhappy, I am,&rdquo; she articulated, and turning
        away, she burst into tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        Left alone, Darya Alexandrovna said her prayers and went to bed. She had
        felt for Anna with all her heart while she was speaking to her, but now
        she could not force herself to think of her. The memories of home and of
        her children rose up in her imagination with a peculiar charm quite new
        to her, with a sort of new brilliance. That world of her own seemed to
        her now so sweet and precious that she would not on any account spend an
        extra day outside it, and she made up her mind that she would certainly
        go back next day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna meantime went back to her boudoir, took a wine-glass and dropped
        into it several drops of a medicine, of which the principal ingredient
        was morphine. After drinking it off and sitting still a little while,
        she went into her bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she went into the bedroom, Vronsky looked intently at her. He was
        looking for traces of the conversation which he knew that, staying so
        long in Dolly&rsquo;s room, she must have had with her. But in her
        expression of restrained excitement, and of a sort of reserve, he could
        find nothing but the beauty that always bewitched him afresh though he
        was used to it, the consciousness of it, and the desire that it should
        affect him. He did not want to ask her what they had been talking of,
        but he hoped that she would tell him something of her own accord. But
        she only said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am so glad you like Dolly. You do, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve known her a long while, you know. She&rsquo;s very
        good-hearted, I suppose, <i>mais excessivement terre-à-terre.</i> Still,
        I&rsquo;m very glad to see her.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He took Anna&rsquo;s hand and looked inquiringly into her eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Misinterpreting the look, she smiled to him. Next morning, in spite of
        the protests of her hosts, Darya Alexandrovna prepared for her homeward
        journey. Levin&rsquo;s coachman, in his by no means new coat and shabby
        hat, with his ill-matched horses and his coach with the patched
        mud-guards, drove with gloomy determination into the covered gravel
        approach.
      </p>

      <p>
        Darya Alexandrovna disliked taking leave of Princess Varvara and the
        gentlemen of the party. After a day spent together, both she and her
        hosts were distinctly aware that they did not get on together, and that
        it was better for them not to meet. Only Anna was sad. She knew that
        now, from Dolly&rsquo;s departure, no one again would stir up within her
        soul the feelings that had been roused by their conversation. It hurt
        her to stir up these feelings, but yet she knew that that was the best
        part of her soul, and that that part of her soul would quickly be
        smothered in the life she was leading.
      </p>

      <p>
        As she drove out into the open country, Darya Alexandrovna had a
        delightful sense of relief, and she felt tempted to ask the two men how
        they had liked being at Vronsky&rsquo;s, when suddenly the coachman,
        Philip, expressed himself unasked:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Rolling in wealth they may be, but three pots of oats was all
        they gave us. Everything cleared up till there wasn&rsquo;t a grain left
        by cockcrow. What are three pots? A mere mouthful! And oats now down to
        forty-five kopecks. At our place, no fear, all comers may have as much
        as they can eat.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The master&rsquo;s a screw,&rdquo; put in the counting-house
        clerk.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, did you like their horses?&rdquo; asked Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The horses!&mdash;there&rsquo;s no two opinions about them. And
        the food was good. But it seemed to me sort of dreary there, Darya
        Alexandrovna. I don&rsquo;t know what you thought,&rdquo; he said,
        turning his handsome, good-natured face to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I thought so too. Well, shall we get home by evening?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Eh, we must!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        On reaching home and finding everyone entirely satisfactory and
        particularly charming, Darya Alexandrovna began with great liveliness
        telling them how she had arrived, how warmly they had received her, of
        the luxury and good taste in which the Vronskys lived, and of their
        recreations, and she would not allow a word to be said against them.
      </p>

        &ldquo;One has to know Anna and Vronsky&mdash;I have got to know him
        better now&mdash;to see how nice they are, and how touching,&rdquo; she
        said, speaking now with perfect sincerity, and forgetting the vague
        feeling of dissatisfaction and awkwardness she had experienced there.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 25</h3>

      <p>
        Vronsky and Anna spent the whole summer and part of the winter in the
        country, living in just the same condition, and still taking no steps to
        obtain a divorce. It was an understood thing between them that they
        should not go away anywhere; but both felt, the longer they lived alone,
        especially in the autumn, without guests in the house, that they could
        not stand this existence, and that they would have to alter it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their life was apparently such that nothing better could be desired.
        They had the fullest abundance of everything; they had a child, and both
        had occupation. Anna devoted just as much care to her appearance when
        they had no visitors, and she did a great deal of reading, both of
        novels and of what serious literature was in fashion. She ordered all
        the books that were praised in the foreign papers and reviews she
        received, and read them with that concentrated attention which is only
        given to what is read in seclusion. Moreover, every subject that was of
        interest to Vronsky, she studied in books and special journals, so that
        he often went straight to her with questions relating to agriculture or
        architecture, sometimes even with questions relating to horse-breeding
        or sport. He was amazed at her knowledge, her memory, and at first was
        disposed to doubt it, to ask for confirmation of her facts; and she
        would find what he asked for in some book, and show it to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        The building of the hospital, too, interested her. She did not merely
        assist, but planned and suggested a great deal herself. But her chief
        thought was still of herself&mdash;how far she was dear to Vronsky, how
        far she could make up to him for all he had given up. Vronsky
        appreciated this desire not only to please, but to serve him, which had
        become the sole aim of her existence, but at the same time he wearied of
        the loving snares in which she tried to hold him fast. As time went on,
        and he saw himself more and more often held fast in these snares, he had
        an ever growing desire, not so much to escape from them, as to try
        whether they hindered his freedom. Had it not been for this growing
        desire to be free, not to have scenes every time he wanted to go to the
        town to a meeting or a race, Vronsky would have been perfectly satisfied
        with his life. The rôle he had taken up, the rôle of a wealthy
        landowner, one of that class which ought to be the very heart of the
        Russian aristocracy, was entirely to his taste; and now, after spending
        six months in that character, he derived even greater satisfaction from
        it. And his management of his estate, which occupied and absorbed him
        more and more, was most successful. In spite of the immense sums cost
        him by the hospital, by machinery, by cows ordered from Switzerland, and
        many other things, he was convinced that he was not wasting, but
        increasing his substance. In all matters affecting income, the sales of
        timber, wheat, and wool, the letting of lands, Vronsky was hard as a
        rock, and knew well how to keep up prices. In all operations on a large
        scale on this and his other estates, he kept to the simplest methods
        involving no risk, and in trifling details he was careful and exacting
        to an extreme degree. In spite of all the cunning and ingenuity of the
        German steward, who would try to tempt him into purchases by making his
        original estimate always far larger than really required, and then
        representing to Vronsky that he might get the thing cheaper, and so make
        a profit, Vronsky did not give in. He listened to his steward,
        cross-examined him, and only agreed to his suggestions when the
        implement to be ordered or constructed was the very newest, not yet
        known in Russia, and likely to excite wonder. Apart from such
        exceptions, he resolved upon an increased outlay only where there was a
        surplus, and in making such an outlay he went into the minutest details,
        and insisted on getting the very best for his money; so that by the
        method on which he managed his affairs, it was clear that he was not
        wasting, but increasing his substance.
      </p>

      <p>
        In October there were the provincial elections in the Kashinsky
        province, where were the estates of Vronsky, Sviazhsky, Koznishev,
        Oblonsky, and a small part of Levin&rsquo;s land.
      </p>

      <p>
        These elections were attracting public attention from several
        circumstances connected with them, and also from the people taking part
        in them. There had been a great deal of talk about them, and great
        preparations were being made for them. Persons who never attended the
        elections were coming from Moscow, from Petersburg, and from abroad to
        attend these. Vronsky had long before promised Sviazhsky to go to them.
        Before the elections Sviazhsky, who often visited Vozdvizhenskoe, drove
        over to fetch Vronsky. On the day before there had been almost a quarrel
        between Vronsky and Anna over this proposed expedition. It was the very
        dullest autumn weather, which is so dreary in the country, and so,
        preparing himself for a struggle, Vronsky, with a hard and cold
        expression, informed Anna of his departure as he had never spoken to her
        before. But, to his surprise, Anna accepted the information with great
        composure, and merely asked when he would be back. He looked intently at
        her, at a loss to explain this composure. She smiled at his look. He
        knew that way she had of withdrawing into herself, and knew that it only
        happened when she had determined upon something without letting him know
        her plans. He was afraid of this; but he was so anxious to avoid a scene
        that he kept up appearances, and half sincerely believed in what he
        longed to believe in&mdash;her reasonableness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t be dull?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;I got a box of books
        yesterday from Gautier&rsquo;s. No, I shan&rsquo;t be dull.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s trying to take that tone, and so much the
        better,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;or else it would be the same thing
        over and over again.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he set off for the elections without appealing to her for a candid
        explanation. It was the first time since the beginning of their intimacy
        that he had parted from her without a full explanation. From one point
        of view this troubled him, but on the other side he felt that it was
        better so. &ldquo;At first there will be, as this time, something
        undefined kept back, and then she will get used to it. In any case I can
        give up anything for her, but not my masculine independence,&rdquo; he
        thought.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 26</h3>

      <p>
        In September Levin moved to Moscow for Kitty&rsquo;s confinement. He had
        spent a whole month in Moscow with nothing to do, when Sergey
        Ivanovitch, who had property in the Kashinsky province, and took great
        interest in the question of the approaching elections, made ready to set
        off to the elections. He invited his brother, who had a vote in the
        Seleznevsky district, to come with him. Levin had, moreover, to transact
        in Kashin some extremely important business relating to the wardship of
        land and to the receiving of certain redemption money for his sister,
        who was abroad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin still hesitated, but Kitty, who saw that he was bored in Moscow,
        and urged him to go, on her own authority ordered him the proper
        nobleman&rsquo;s uniform, costing seven pounds. And that seven pounds
        paid for the uniform was the chief cause that finally decided Levin to
        go. He went to Kashin....
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin had been six days in Kashin, visiting the assembly each day, and
        busily engaged about his sister&rsquo;s business, which still dragged
        on. The district marshals of nobility were all occupied with the
        elections, and it was impossible to get the simplest thing done that
        depended upon the court of wardship. The other matter, the payment of
        the sums due, was met too by difficulties. After long negotiations over
        the legal details, the money was at last ready to be paid; but the
        notary, a most obliging person, could not hand over the order, because
        it must have the signature of the president, and the president, though
        he had not given over his duties to a deputy, was at the elections. All
        these worrying negotiations, this endless going from place to place, and
        talking with pleasant and excellent people, who quite saw the
        unpleasantness of the petitioner&rsquo;s position, but were powerless to
        assist him&mdash;all these efforts that yielded no result, led to a
        feeling of misery in Levin akin to the mortifying helplessness one
        experiences in dreams when one tries to use physical force. He felt this
        frequently as he talked to his most good-natured solicitor. This
        solicitor did, it seemed, everything possible, and strained every nerve
        to get him out of his difficulties. &ldquo;I tell you what you might
        try,&rdquo; he said more than once; &ldquo;go to so-and-so and
        so-and-so,&rdquo; and the solicitor drew up a regular plan for getting
        round the fatal point that hindered everything. But he would add
        immediately, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll mean some delay, anyway, but you might
        try it.&rdquo; And Levin did try, and did go. Everyone was kind and
        civil, but the point evaded seemed to crop up again in the end, and
        again to bar the way. What was particularly trying, was that Levin could
        not make out with whom he was struggling, to whose interest it was that
        his business should not be done. That no one seemed to know; the
        solicitor certainly did not know. If Levin could have understood why,
        just as he saw why one can only approach the booking office of a railway
        station in single file, it would not have been so vexatious and tiresome
        to him. But with the hindrances that confronted him in his business, no
        one could explain why they existed.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Levin had changed a good deal since his marriage; he was patient,
        and if he could not see why it was all arranged like this, he told
        himself that he could not judge without knowing all about it, and that
        most likely it must be so, and he tried not to fret.
      </p>

      <p>
        In attending the elections, too, and taking part in them, he tried now
        not to judge, not to fall foul of them, but to comprehend as fully as he
        could the question which was so earnestly and ardently absorbing honest
        and excellent men whom he respected. Since his marriage there had been
        revealed to Levin so many new and serious aspects of life that had
        previously, through his frivolous attitude to them, seemed of no
        importance, that in the question of the elections too he assumed and
        tried to find some serious significance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch explained to him the meaning and object of the
        proposed revolution at the elections. The marshal of the province in
        whose hands the law had placed the control of so many important public
        functions&mdash;the guardianship of wards (the very department which was
        giving Levin so much trouble just now), the disposal of large sums
        subscribed by the nobility of the province, the high schools, female,
        male, and military, and popular instruction on the new model, and
        finally, the district council&mdash;the marshal of the province,
        Snetkov, was a nobleman of the old school,&mdash;dissipating an immense
        fortune, a good-hearted man, honest after his own fashion, but utterly
        without any comprehension of the needs of modern days. He always took,
        in every question, the side of the nobility; he was positively
        antagonistic to the spread of popular education, and he succeeded in
        giving a purely party character to the district council which ought by
        rights to be of such an immense importance. What was needed was to put
        in his place a fresh, capable, perfectly modern man, of contemporary
        ideas, and to frame their policy so as from the rights conferred upon
        the nobles, not as the nobility, but as an element of the district
        council, to extract all the powers of self-government that could
        possibly be derived from them. In the wealthy Kashinsky province, which
        always took the lead of other provinces in everything, there was now
        such a preponderance of forces that this policy, once carried through
        properly there, might serve as a model for other provinces for all
        Russia. And hence the whole question was of the greatest importance. It
        was proposed to elect as marshal in place of Snetkov either Sviazhsky,
        or, better still, Nevyedovsky, a former university professor, a man of
        remarkable intelligence and a great friend of Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        The meeting was opened by the governor, who made a speech to the nobles,
        urging them to elect the public functionaries, not from regard for
        persons, but for the service and welfare of their fatherland, and hoping
        that the honorable nobility of the Kashinsky province would, as at all
        former elections, hold their duty as sacred, and vindicate the exalted
        confidence of the monarch.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he had finished with his speech, the governor walked out of the
        hall, and the noblemen noisily and eagerly&mdash;some even
        enthusiastically&mdash;followed him and thronged round him while he put
        on his fur coat and conversed amicably with the marshal of the province.
        Levin, anxious to see into everything and not to miss anything, stood
        there too in the crowd, and heard the governor say: &ldquo;Please tell
        Marya Ivanovna my wife is very sorry she couldn&rsquo;t come to the
        Home.&rdquo; And thereupon the nobles in high good-humor sorted out
        their fur coats and all drove off to the cathedral.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the cathedral Levin, lifting his hand like the rest and repeating the
        words of the archdeacon, swore with most terrible oaths to do all the
        governor had hoped they would do. Church services always affected Levin,
        and as he uttered the words &ldquo;I kiss the cross,&rdquo; and glanced
        round at the crowd of young and old men repeating the same, he felt
        touched.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the second and third days there was business relating to the finances
        of the nobility and the female high school, of no importance whatever,
        as Sergey Ivanovitch explained, and Levin, busy seeing after his own
        affairs, did not attend the meetings. On the fourth day the auditing of
        the marshal&rsquo;s accounts took place at the high table of the marshal
        of the province. And then there occurred the first skirmish between the
        new party and the old. The committee who had been deputed to verify the
        accounts reported to the meeting that all was in order. The marshal of
        the province got up, thanked the nobility for their confidence, and shed
        tears. The nobles gave him a loud welcome, and shook hands with him. But
        at that instant a nobleman of Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s party said that
        he had heard that the committee had not verified the accounts,
        considering such a verification an insult to the marshal of the
        province. One of the members of the committee incautiously admitted
        this. Then a small gentleman, very young-looking but very malignant,
        began to say that it would probably be agreeable to the marshal of the
        province to give an account of his expenditures of the public moneys,
        and that the misplaced delicacy of the members of the committee was
        depriving him of this moral satisfaction. Then the members of the
        committee tried to withdraw their admission, and Sergey Ivanovitch began
        to prove that they must logically admit either that they had verified
        the accounts or that they had not, and he developed this dilemma in
        detail. Sergey Ivanovitch was answered by the spokesman of the opposite
        party. Then Sviazhsky spoke, and then the malignant gentleman again. The
        discussion lasted a long time and ended in nothing. Levin was surprised
        that they should dispute upon this subject so long, especially as, when
        he asked Sergey Ivanovitch whether he supposed that money had been
        misappropriated, Sergey Ivanovitch answered:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no! He&rsquo;s an honest man. But those old-fashioned methods
        of paternal family arrangements in the management of provincial affairs
        must be broken down.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        On the fifth day came the elections of the district marshals. It was
        rather a stormy day in several districts. In the Seleznevsky district
        Sviazhsky was elected unanimously without a ballot, and he gave a dinner
        that evening.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 27</h3>

      <p>
        The sixth day was fixed for the election of the marshal of the province.
      </p>

      <p>
        The rooms, large and small, were full of noblemen in all sorts of
        uniforms. Many had come only for that day. Men who had not seen each
        other for years, some from the Crimea, some from Petersburg, some from
        abroad, met in the rooms of the Hall of Nobility. There was much
        discussion around the governor&rsquo;s table under the portrait of the
        Tsar.
      </p>

      <p>
        The nobles, both in the larger and the smaller rooms, grouped themselves
        in camps, and from their hostile and suspicious glances, from the
        silence that fell upon them when outsiders approached a group, and from
        the way that some, whispering together, retreated to the farther
        corridor, it was evident that each side had secrets from the other. In
        appearance the noblemen were sharply divided into two classes: the old
        and the new. The old were for the most part either in old uniforms of
        the nobility, buttoned up closely, with spurs and hats, or in their own
        special naval, cavalry, infantry, or official uniforms. The uniforms of
        the older men were embroidered in the old-fashioned way with epaulets on
        their shoulders; they were unmistakably tight and short in the waist, as
        though their wearers had grown out of them. The younger men wore the
        uniform of the nobility with long waists and broad shoulders, unbuttoned
        over white waistcoats, or uniforms with black collars and with the
        embroidered badges of justices of the peace. To the younger men belonged
        the court uniforms that here and there brightened up the crowd.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the division into young and old did not correspond with the division
        of parties. Some of the young men, as Levin observed, belonged to the
        old party; and some of the very oldest noblemen, on the contrary, were
        whispering with Sviazhsky, and were evidently ardent partisans of the
        new party.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin stood in the smaller room, where they were smoking and taking
        light refreshments, close to his own friends, and listening to what they
        were saying, he conscientiously exerted all his intelligence trying to
        understand what was said. Sergey Ivanovitch was the center round which
        the others grouped themselves. He was listening at that moment to
        Sviazhsky and Hliustov, the marshal of another district, who belonged to
        their party. Hliustov would not agree to go with his district to ask
        Snetkov to stand, while Sviazhsky was persuading him to do so, and
        Sergey Ivanovitch was approving of the plan. Levin could not make out
        why the opposition was to ask the marshal to stand whom they wanted to
        supersede.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had just been drinking and taking some lunch,
        came up to them in his uniform of a gentleman of the bedchamber, wiping
        his lips with a perfumed handkerchief of bordered batiste.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We are placing our forces,&rdquo; he said, pulling out his
        whiskers, &ldquo;Sergey Ivanovitch!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And listening to the conversation, he supported Sviazhsky&rsquo;s
        contention.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;One district&rsquo;s enough, and Sviazhsky&rsquo;s obviously of
        the opposition,&rdquo; he said, words evidently intelligible to all
        except Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, Kostya, you here too! I suppose you&rsquo;re converted,
        eh?&rdquo; he added, turning to Levin and drawing his arm through his.
        Levin would have been glad indeed to be converted, but could not make
        out what the point was, and retreating a few steps from the speakers, he
        explained to Stepan Arkadyevitch his inability to understand why the
        marshal of the province should be asked to stand.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>&ldquo;O sancta simplicitas!&rdquo;</i> said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and
        briefly and clearly he explained it to Levin. If, as at previous
        elections, all the districts asked the marshal of the province to stand,
        then he would be elected without a ballot. That must not be. Now eight
        districts had agreed to call upon him: if two refused to do so, Snetkov
        might decline to stand at all; and then the old party might choose
        another of their party, which would throw them completely out in their
        reckoning. But if only one district, Sviazhsky&rsquo;s, did not call
        upon him to stand, Snetkov would let himself be balloted for. They were
        even, some of them, going to vote for him, and purposely to let him get
        a good many votes, so that the enemy might be thrown off the scent, and
        when a candidate of the other side was put up, they too might give him
        some votes. Levin understood to some extent, but not fully, and would
        have put a few more questions, when suddenly everyone began talking and
        making a noise and they moved towards the big room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it? eh? whom?&rdquo; &ldquo;No guarantee? whose?
        what?&rdquo; &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t pass him?&rdquo; &ldquo;No
        guarantee?&rdquo; &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t let Flerov in?&rdquo;
        &ldquo;Eh, because of the charge against him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, at this
        rate, they won&rsquo;t admit anyone. It&rsquo;s a swindle!&rdquo;
        &ldquo;The law!&rdquo; Levin heard exclamations on all sides, and he
        moved into the big room together with the others, all hurrying somewhere
        and afraid of missing something. Squeezed by the crowding noblemen, he
        drew near the high table where the marshal of the province, Sviazhsky,
        and the other leaders were hotly disputing about something.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 28</h3>

      <p>
        Levin was standing rather far off. A nobleman breathing heavily and
        hoarsely at his side, and another whose thick boots were creaking,
        prevented him from hearing distinctly. He could only hear the soft voice
        of the marshal faintly, then the shrill voice of the malignant
        gentleman, and then the voice of Sviazhsky. They were disputing, as far
        as he could make out, as to the interpretation to be put on the act and
        the exact meaning of the words: &ldquo;liable to be called up for
        trial.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The crowd parted to make way for Sergey Ivanovitch approaching the
        table. Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till the malignant gentleman had
        finished speaking, said that he thought the best solution would be to
        refer to the act itself, and asked the secretary to find the act. The
        act said that in case of difference of opinion, there must be a ballot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch read the act and began to explain its meaning, but at
        that point a tall, stout, round-shouldered landowner, with dyed
        whiskers, in a tight uniform that cut the back of his neck, interrupted
        him. He went up to the table, and striking it with his finger ring, he
        shouted loudly: &ldquo;A ballot! Put it to the vote! No need for more
        talking!&rdquo; Then several voices began to talk all at once, and the
        tall nobleman with the ring, getting more and more exasperated, shouted
        more and more loudly. But it was impossible to make out what he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was shouting for the very course Sergey Ivanovitch had proposed; but
        it was evident that he hated him and all his party, and this feeling of
        hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the
        same vindictiveness, though in a more seemly form, on the other side.
        Shouts were raised, and for a moment all was confusion, so that the
        marshal of the province had to call for order.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A ballot! A ballot! Every nobleman sees it! We shed our blood for
        our country!... The confidence of the monarch.... No checking the
        accounts of the marshal; he&rsquo;s not a cashier.... But that&rsquo;s
        not the point.... Votes, please! Beastly!...&rdquo; shouted furious and
        violent voices on all sides. Looks and faces were even more violent and
        furious than their words. They expressed the most implacable hatred.
        Levin did not in the least understand what was the matter, and he
        marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the
        decision about Flerov should be put to the vote. He forgot, as Sergey
        Ivanovitch explained to him afterwards, this syllogism: that it was
        necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province;
        that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of
        votes; that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure
        Flerov&rsquo;s right to vote; that to secure the recognition of
        Flerov&rsquo;s right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to
        be put on the act.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And one vote may decide the whole question, and one must be
        serious and consecutive, if one wants to be of use in public
        life,&rdquo; concluded Sergey Ivanovitch. But Levin forgot all that, and
        it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons, for whom he
        had a respect, in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement. To
        escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where
        there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar. Seeing the
        waiters busy over washing up the crockery and setting in order their
        plates and wine-glasses, seeing their calm and cheerful faces, Levin
        felt an unexpected sense of relief as though he had come out of a stuffy
        room into the fresh air. He began walking up and down, looking with
        pleasure at the waiters. He particularly liked the way one
        gray-whiskered waiter, who showed his scorn for the other younger ones
        and was jeered at by them, was teaching them how to fold up napkins
        properly. Levin was just about to enter into conversation with the old
        waiter, when the secretary of the court of wardship, a little old man
        whose specialty it was to know all the noblemen of the province by name
        and patronymic, drew him away.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Please come, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your
        brother&rsquo;s looking for you. They are voting on the legal
        point.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin walked into the room, received a white ball, and followed his
        brother, Sergey Ivanovitch, to the table where Sviazhsky was standing
        with a significant and ironical face, holding his beard in his fist and
        sniffing at it. Sergey Ivanovitch put his hand into the box, put the
        ball somewhere, and making room for Levin, stopped. Levin advanced, but
        utterly forgetting what he was to do, and much embarrassed, he turned to
        Sergey Ivanovitch with the question, &ldquo;Where am I to put it?&rdquo;
        He asked this softly, at a moment when there was talking going on near,
        so that he had hoped his question would not be overheard. But the
        persons speaking paused, and his improper question was overheard. Sergey
        Ivanovitch frowned.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That is a matter for each man&rsquo;s own decision,&rdquo; he
        said severely.
      </p>

      <p>
        Several people smiled. Levin crimsoned, hurriedly thrust his hand under
        the cloth, and put the ball to the right as it was in his right hand.
        Having put it in, he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left
        hand too, and so he thrust it in though too late, and, still more
        overcome with confusion, he beat a hasty retreat into the background.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A hundred and twenty-six for admission! Ninety-eight
        against!&rdquo; sang out the voice of the secretary, who could not
        pronounce the letter
        <i>r</i>. Then there was a laugh; a button and two nuts were found in
        the box. The nobleman was allowed the right to vote, and the new party
        had conquered.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the old party did not consider themselves conquered. Levin heard
        that they were asking Snetkov to stand, and he saw that a crowd of
        noblemen was surrounding the marshal, who was saying something. Levin
        went nearer. In reply Snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the
        province had placed in him, the affection they had shown him, which he
        did not deserve, as his only merit had been his attachment to the
        nobility, to whom he had devoted twelve years of service. Several times
        he repeated the words: &ldquo;I have served to the best of my powers
        with truth and good faith, I value your goodness and thank you,&rdquo;
        and suddenly he stopped short from the tears that choked him, and went
        out of the room. Whether these tears came from a sense of the injustice
        being done him, from his love for the nobility, or from the strain of
        the position he was placed in, feeling himself surrounded by enemies,
        his emotion infected the assembly, the majority were touched, and Levin
        felt a tenderness for Snetkov.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Beg pardon, excuse me, please,&rdquo; he said as to a stranger,
        but recognizing Levin, he smiled timidly. It seemed to Levin that he
        would have liked to say something, but could not speak for emotion. His
        face and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses, and white
        trousers striped with braid, as he moved hurriedly along, reminded Levin
        of some hunted beast who sees that he is in evil case. This expression
        in the marshal&rsquo;s face was particularly touching to Levin, because,
        only the day before, he had been at his house about his trustee business
        and had seen him in all his grandeur, a kind-hearted, fatherly man. The
        big house with the old family furniture; the rather dirty, far from
        stylish, but respectful footmen, unmistakably old house serfs who had
        stuck to their master; the stout, good-natured wife in a cap with lace
        and a Turkish shawl, petting her pretty grandchild, her daughter&rsquo;s
        daughter; the young son, a sixth form high school boy, coming home from
        school, and greeting his father, kissing his big hand; the genuine,
        cordial words and gestures of the old man&mdash;all this had the day
        before roused an instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in Levin.
        This old man was a touching and pathetic figure to Levin now, and he
        longed to say something pleasant to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re sure to be our marshal again,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not likely,&rdquo; said the marshal, looking round
        with a scared expression. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worn out, I&rsquo;m old. If
        there are men younger and more deserving than I, let them serve.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And the marshal disappeared through a side door.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most solemn moment was at hand. They were to proceed immediately to
        the election. The leaders of both parties were reckoning white and black
        on their fingers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The discussion upon Flerov had given the new party not only
        Flerov&rsquo;s vote, but had also gained time for them, so that they
        could send to fetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable to take
        part in the elections by the wiles of the other party. Two noble
        gentlemen, who had a weakness for strong drink, had been made drunk by
        the partisans of Snetkov, and a third had been robbed of his uniform.
      </p>

      <p>
        On learning this, the new party had made haste, during the dispute about
        Flerov, to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the stripped
        gentleman, and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought one, drenched him with water,&rdquo; said the
        landowner, who had gone on this errand, to Sviazhsky. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
        all right? he&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not too drunk, he won&rsquo;t fall down?&rdquo; said Sviazhsky,
        shaking his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s first-rate. If only they don&rsquo;t give him any
        more here.... I&rsquo;ve told the waiter not to give him anything on any
        account.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 29</h3>

      <p>
        The narrow room, in which they were smoking and taking refreshments, was
        full of noblemen. The excitement grew more intense, and every face
        betrayed some uneasiness. The excitement was specially keen for the
        leaders of each party, who knew every detail, and had reckoned up every
        vote. They were the generals organizing the approaching battle. The
        rest, like the rank and file before an engagement, though they were
        getting ready for the fight, sought for other distractions in the
        interval. Some were lunching, standing at the bar, or sitting at the
        table; others were walking up and down the long room, smoking
        cigarettes, and talking with friends whom they had not seen for a long
        while.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin did not care to eat, and he was not smoking; he did not want to
        join his own friends, that is Sergey Ivanovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        Sviazhsky and the rest, because Vronsky in his equerry&rsquo;s uniform
        was standing with them in eager conversation. Levin had seen him already
        at the meeting on the previous day, and he had studiously avoided him,
        not caring to greet him. He went to the window and sat down, scanning
        the groups, and listening to what was being said around him. He felt
        depressed, especially because everyone else was, as he saw, eager,
        anxious, and interested, and he alone, with an old, toothless little man
        with mumbling lips wearing a naval uniform, sitting beside him, had no
        interest in it and nothing to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a blackguard! I have told him so, but it makes no
        difference. Only think of it! He couldn&rsquo;t collect it in three
        years!&rdquo; he heard vigorously uttered by a round-shouldered, short,
        country gentleman, who had pomaded hair hanging on his embroidered
        collar, and new boots obviously put on for the occasion, with heels that
        tapped energetically as he spoke. Casting a displeased glance at Levin,
        this gentleman sharply turned his back.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a dirty business, there&rsquo;s no
        denying,&rdquo; a small gentleman assented in a high voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, a whole crowd of country gentlemen, surrounding a stout general,
        hurriedly came near Levin. These persons were unmistakably seeking a
        place where they could talk without being overheard.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How dare he say I had his breeches stolen! Pawned them for drink,
        I expect. Damn the fellow, prince indeed! He&rsquo;d better not say it,
        the beast!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But excuse me! They take their stand on the act,&rdquo; was being
        said in another group; &ldquo;the wife must be registered as
        noble.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, damn your acts! I speak from my heart. We&rsquo;re all
        gentlemen, aren&rsquo;t we? Above suspicion.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall we go on, your excellency, <i>fine champagne?</i>&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Another group was following a nobleman, who was shouting something in a
        loud voice; it was one of the three intoxicated gentlemen.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I always advised Marya Semyonovna to let for a fair rent, for she
        can never save a profit,&rdquo; he heard a pleasant voice say. The
        speaker was a country gentleman with gray whiskers, wearing the
        regimental uniform of an old general staff-officer. It was the very
        landowner Levin had met at Sviazhsky&rsquo;s. He knew him at once. The
        landowner too stared at Levin, and they exchanged greetings.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very glad to see you! To be sure! I remember you very well. Last
        year at our district marshal, Nikolay Ivanovitch&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and how is your land doing?&rdquo; asked Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, still just the same, always at a loss,&rdquo; the landowner
        answered with a resigned smile, but with an expression of serenity and
        conviction that so it must be. &ldquo;And how do you come to be in our
        province?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Come to take part in our
        <i>coup d&rsquo;état?</i>&rdquo; he said, confidently pronouncing the
        French words with a bad accent. &ldquo;All Russia&rsquo;s
        here&mdash;gentlemen of the bedchamber, and everything short of the
        ministry.&rdquo; He pointed to the imposing figure of Stepan
        Arkadyevitch in white trousers and his court uniform, walking by with a
        general.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I ought to own that I don&rsquo;t very well understand the drift
        of the provincial elections,&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        The landowner looked at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, what is there to understand? There&rsquo;s no meaning in it
        at all. It&rsquo;s a decaying institution that goes on running only by
        the force of inertia. Just look, the very uniforms tell you that
        it&rsquo;s an assembly of justices of the peace, permanent members of
        the court, and so on, but not of noblemen.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then why do you come?&rdquo; asked Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;From habit, nothing else. Then, too, one must keep up
        connections. It&rsquo;s a moral obligation of a sort. And then, to tell
        the truth, there&rsquo;s one&rsquo;s own interests. My son-in-law wants
        to stand as a permanent member; they&rsquo;re not rich people, and he
        must be brought forward. These gentlemen, now, what do they come
        for?&rdquo; he said, pointing to the malignant gentleman, who was
        talking at the high table.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the new generation of nobility.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;New it may be, but nobility it isn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re
        proprietors of a sort, but we&rsquo;re the landowners. As noblemen,
        they&rsquo;re cutting their own throats.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you say it&rsquo;s an institution that&rsquo;s served its
        time.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That it may be, but still it ought to be treated a little more
        respectfully. Snetkov, now.... We may be of use, or we may not, but
        we&rsquo;re the growth of a thousand years. If we&rsquo;re laying out a
        garden, planning one before the house, you know, and there you&rsquo;ve
        a tree that&rsquo;s stood for centuries in the very spot.... Old and
        gnarled it may be, and yet you don&rsquo;t cut down the old fellow to
        make room for the flowerbeds, but lay out your beds so as to take
        advantage of the tree. You won&rsquo;t grow him again in a year,&rdquo;
        he said cautiously, and he immediately changed the conversation.
        &ldquo;Well, and how is your land doing?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, not very well. I make five per cent.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but you don&rsquo;t reckon your own work. Aren&rsquo;t you
        worth something too? I&rsquo;ll tell you my own case. Before I took to
        seeing after the land, I had a salary of three hundred pounds from the
        service. Now I do more work than I did in the service, and like you I
        get five per cent. on the land, and thank God for that. But one&rsquo;s
        work is thrown in for nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then why do you do it, if it&rsquo;s a clear loss?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, one does it! What would you have? It&rsquo;s habit, and
        one knows it&rsquo;s how it should be. And what&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; the
        landowner went on, leaning his elbows on the window and chatting on,
        &ldquo;my son, I must tell you, has no taste for it. There&rsquo;s no
        doubt he&rsquo;ll be a scientific man. So there&rsquo;ll be no one to
        keep it up. And yet one does it. Here this year I&rsquo;ve planted an
        orchard.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Levin, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s perfectly true.
        I always feel there&rsquo;s no real balance of gain in my work on the
        land, and yet one does it.... It&rsquo;s a sort of duty one feels to the
        land.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I tell you what,&rdquo; the landowner pursued; &ldquo;a
        neighbor of mine, a merchant, was at my place. We walked about the
        fields and the garden. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;Stepan
        Vassilievitch, everything&rsquo;s well looked after, but your
        garden&rsquo;s neglected.&rsquo; But, as a fact, it&rsquo;s well kept
        up. &lsquo;To my thinking, I&rsquo;d cut down that lime-tree. Here
        you&rsquo;ve thousands of limes, and each would make two good bundles of
        bark. And nowadays that bark&rsquo;s worth something. I&rsquo;d cut down
        the lot.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And with what he made he&rsquo;d increase his stock, or buy some
        land for a trifle, and let it out in lots to the peasants,&rdquo; Levin
        added, smiling. He had evidently more than once come across those
        commercial calculations. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;d make his fortune. But you
        and I must thank God if we keep what we&rsquo;ve got and leave it to our
        children.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re married, I&rsquo;ve heard?&rdquo; said the
        landowner.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Levin answered, with proud satisfaction. &ldquo;Yes,
        it&rsquo;s rather strange,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;So we live without
        making anything, as though we were ancient vestals set to keep in a
        fire.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The landowner chuckled under his white mustaches.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There are some among us, too, like our friend Nikolay Ivanovitch,
        or Count Vronsky, that&rsquo;s settled here lately, who try to carry on
        their husbandry as though it were a factory; but so far it leads to
        nothing but making away with capital on it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But why is it we don&rsquo;t do like the merchants? Why
        don&rsquo;t we cut down our parks for timber?&rdquo; said Levin,
        returning to a thought that had struck him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, as you said, to keep the fire in. Besides that&rsquo;s not
        work for a nobleman. And our work as noblemen isn&rsquo;t done here at
        the elections, but yonder, each in our corner. There&rsquo;s a class
        instinct, too, of what one ought and oughtn&rsquo;t to do. There&rsquo;s
        the peasants, too, I wonder at them sometimes; any good peasant tries to
        take all the land he can. However bad the land is, he&rsquo;ll work it.
        Without a return too. At a simple loss.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Just as we do,&rdquo; said Levin. &ldquo;Very, very glad to have
        met you,&rdquo; he added, seeing Sviazhsky approaching him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And here we&rsquo;ve met for the first time since we met at your
        place,&rdquo; said the landowner to Sviazhsky, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve
        had a good talk too.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, have you been attacking the new order of things?&rdquo;
        said Sviazhsky with a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That we&rsquo;re bound to do.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve relieved your feelings?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 30</h3>

      <p>
        Sviazhsky took Levin&rsquo;s arm, and went with him to his own friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time there was no avoiding Vronsky. He was standing with Stepan
        Arkadyevitch and Sergey Ivanovitch, and looking straight at Levin as he
        drew near.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Delighted! I believe I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of meeting you
        ... at Princess Shtcherbatskaya&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said, giving Levin
        his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I quite remember our meeting,&rdquo; said Levin, and
        blushing crimson, he turned away immediately, and began talking to his
        brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a slight smile Vronsky went on talking to Sviazhsky, obviously
        without the slightest inclination to enter into conversation with Levin.
        But Levin, as he talked to his brother, was continually looking round at
        Vronsky, trying to think of something to say to him to gloss over his
        rudeness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What are we waiting for now?&rdquo; asked Levin, looking at
        Sviazhsky and Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For Snetkov. He has to refuse or to consent to stand,&rdquo;
        answered Sviazhsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and what has he done, consented or not?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the point, that he&rsquo;s done neither,&rdquo; said
        Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And if he refuses, who will stand then?&rdquo; asked Levin,
        looking at Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Whoever chooses to,&rdquo; said Sviazhsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall you?&rdquo; asked Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly not I,&rdquo; said Sviazhsky, looking confused, and
        turning an alarmed glance at the malignant gentleman, who was standing
        beside Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who then? Nevyedovsky?&rdquo; said Levin, feeling he was putting
        his foot into it.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this was worse still. Nevyedovsky and Sviazhsky were the two
        candidates.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I certainly shall not, under any circumstances,&rdquo; answered
        the malignant gentleman.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was Nevyedovsky himself. Sviazhsky introduced him to Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you find it exciting too?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        winking at Vronsky. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something like a race. One might
        bet on it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it is keenly exciting,&rdquo; said Vronsky. &ldquo;And once
        taking the thing up, one&rsquo;s eager to see it through. It&rsquo;s a
        fight!&rdquo; he said, scowling and setting his powerful jaws.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a capable fellow Sviazhsky is! Sees it all so
        clearly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; Vronsky assented indifferently.
      </p>

      <p>
        A silence followed, during which Vronsky&mdash;since he had to look at
        something&mdash;looked at Levin, at his feet, at his uniform, then at
        his face, and noticing his gloomy eyes fixed upon him, he said, in order
        to say something:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How is it that you, living constantly in the country, are not a
        justice of the peace? You are not in the uniform of one.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I consider that the justice of the peace is a
        silly institution,&rdquo; Levin answered gloomily. He had been all the
        time looking for an opportunity to enter into conversation with Vronsky,
        so as to smooth over his rudeness at their first meeting.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, quite the contrary,&rdquo; Vronsky said,
        with quiet surprise.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a plaything,&rdquo; Levin cut him short. &ldquo;We
        don&rsquo;t want justices of the peace. I&rsquo;ve never had a single
        thing to do with them during eight years. And what I have had was
        decided wrongly by them. The justice of the peace is over thirty miles
        from me. For some matter of two roubles I should have to send a lawyer,
        who costs me fifteen.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he related how a peasant had stolen some flour from the miller, and
        when the miller told him of it, had lodged a complaint for slander. All
        this was utterly uncalled for and stupid, and Levin felt it himself as
        he said it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, this is such an original fellow!&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch with his most soothing, almond-oil smile. &ldquo;But come
        along; I think they&rsquo;re voting....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And they separated.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch, who had
        observed his brother&rsquo;s clumsiness, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand
        how anyone can be so absolutely devoid of political tact. That&rsquo;s
        where we Russians are so deficient. The marshal of the province is our
        opponent, and with him you&rsquo;re <i>ami cochon</i>, and you beg him
        to stand. Count Vronsky, now ... I&rsquo;m not making a friend of him;
        he&rsquo;s asked me to dinner, and I&rsquo;m not going; but he&rsquo;s
        one of our side&mdash;why make an enemy of him? Then you ask Nevyedovsky
        if he&rsquo;s going to stand. That&rsquo;s not a thing to do.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t understand it at all! And it&rsquo;s all such
        nonsense,&rdquo; Levin answered gloomily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You say it&rsquo;s all such nonsense, but as soon as you have
        anything to do with it, you make a muddle.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin did not answer, and they walked together into the big room.
      </p>

      <p>
        The marshal of the province, though he was vaguely conscious in the air
        of some trap being prepared for him, and though he had not been called
        upon by all to stand, had still made up his mind to stand. All was
        silence in the room. The secretary announced in a loud voice that the
        captain of the guards, Mihail Stepanovitch Snetkov, would now be
        balloted for as marshal of the province.
      </p>

      <p>
        The district marshals walked carrying plates, on which were balls, from
        their tables to the high table, and the election began.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Put it in the right side,&rdquo; whispered Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        as with his brother Levin followed the marshal of his district to the
        table. But Levin had forgotten by now the calculations that had been
        explained to him, and was afraid Stepan Arkadyevitch might be mistaken
        in saying &ldquo;the right side.&rdquo; Surely Snetkov was the enemy. As
        he went up, he held the ball in his right hand, but thinking he was
        wrong, just at the box he changed to the left hand, and undoubtedly put
        the ball to the left. An adept in the business, standing at the box and
        seeing by the mere action of the elbow where each put his ball, scowled
        with annoyance. It was no good for him to use his insight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything was still, and the counting of the balls was heard. Then a
        single voice rose and proclaimed the numbers for and against. The
        marshal had been voted for by a considerable majority. All was noise and
        eager movement towards the doors. Snetkov came in, and the nobles
        thronged round him, congratulating him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, now is it over?&rdquo; Levin asked Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only just beginning,&rdquo; Sviazhsky said, replying
        for Sergey Ivanovitch with a smile. &ldquo;Some other candidate may
        receive more votes than the marshal.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin had quite forgotten about that. Now he could only remember that
        there was some sort of trickery in it, but he was too bored to think
        what it was exactly. He felt depressed, and longed to get out of the
        crowd.
      </p>

      <p>
        As no one was paying any attention to him, and no one apparently needed
        him, he quietly slipped away into the little room where the refreshments
        were, and again had a great sense of comfort when he saw the waiters.
        The little old waiter pressed him to have something, and Levin agreed.
        After eating a cutlet with beans and talking to the waiters of their
        former masters, Levin, not wishing to go back to the hall, where it was
        all so distasteful to him, proceeded to walk through the galleries. The
        galleries were full of fashionably dressed ladies, leaning over the
        balustrade and trying not to lose a single word of what was being said
        below. With the ladies were sitting and standing smart lawyers, high
        school teachers in spectacles, and officers. Everywhere they were
        talking of the election, and of how worried the marshal was, and how
        splendid the discussions had been. In one group Levin heard his
        brother&rsquo;s praises. One lady was telling a lawyer:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How glad I am I heard Koznishev! It&rsquo;s worth losing
        one&rsquo;s dinner. He&rsquo;s exquisite! So clear and distinct all of
        it! There&rsquo;s not one of you in the law courts that speaks like
        that. The only one is Meidel, and he&rsquo;s not so eloquent by a long
        way.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Finding a free place, Levin leaned over the balustrade and began looking
        and listening.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the noblemen were sitting railed off behind barriers according to
        their districts. In the middle of the room stood a man in a uniform, who
        shouted in a loud, high voice:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;As a candidate for the marshalship of the nobility of the
        province we call upon staff-captain Yevgeney Ivanovitch Apuhtin!&rdquo;
        A dead silence followed, and then a weak old voice was heard:
        &ldquo;Declined!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We call upon the privy councilor Pyotr Petrovitch Bol,&rdquo; the
        voice began again.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Declined!&rdquo; a high boyish voice replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again it began, and again &ldquo;Declined.&rdquo; And so it went on for
        about an hour. Levin, with his elbows on the balustrade, looked and
        listened. At first he wondered and wanted to know what it meant; then
        feeling sure that he could not make it out he began to be bored. Then
        recalling all the excitement and vindictiveness he had seen on all the
        faces, he felt sad; he made up his mind to go, and went downstairs. As
        he passed through the entry to the galleries he met a dejected high
        school boy walking up and down with tired-looking eyes. On the stairs he
        met a couple&mdash;a lady running quickly on her high heels and the
        jaunty deputy prosecutor.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I told you you weren&rsquo;t late,&rdquo; the deputy prosecutor
        was saying at the moment when Levin moved aside to let the lady pass.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin was on the stairs to the way out, and was just feeling in his
        waistcoat pocket for the number of his overcoat, when the secretary
        overtook him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This way, please, Konstantin Dmitrievitch; they are
        voting.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The candidate who was being voted on was Nevyedovsky, who had so stoutly
        denied all idea of standing. Levin went up to the door of the room; it
        was locked. The secretary knocked, the door opened, and Levin was met by
        two red-faced gentlemen, who darted out.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand any more of it,&rdquo; said one red-faced
        gentleman.
      </p>

      <p>
        After them the face of the marshal of the province was poked out. His
        face was dreadful-looking from exhaustion and dismay.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I told you not to let anyone out!&rdquo; he cried to the
        doorkeeper.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I let someone in, your excellency!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mercy on us!&rdquo; and with a heavy sigh the marshal of the
        province walked with downcast head to the high table in the middle of
        the room, his legs staggering in his white trousers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nevyedovsky had scored a higher majority, as they had planned, and he
        was the new marshal of the province. Many people were amused, many were
        pleased and happy, many were in ecstasies, many were disgusted and
        unhappy. The former marshal of the province was in a state of despair,
        which he could not conceal. When Nevyedovsky went out of the room, the
        crowd thronged round him and followed him enthusiastically, just as they
        had followed the governor who had opened the meetings, and just as they
        had followed Snetkov when he was elected.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 31</h3>

      <p>
        The newly elected marshal and many of the successful party dined that
        day with Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky had come to the elections partly because he was bored in the
        country and wanted to show Anna his right to independence, and also to
        repay Sviazhsky by his support at the election for all the trouble he
        had taken for Vronsky at the district council election, but chiefly in
        order strictly to perform all those duties of a nobleman and landowner
        which he had taken upon himself. But he had not in the least expected
        that the election would so interest him, so keenly excite him, and that
        he would be so good at this kind of thing. He was quite a new man in the
        circle of the nobility of the province, but his success was
        unmistakable, and he was not wrong in supposing that he had already
        obtained a certain influence. This influence was due to his wealth and
        reputation, the capital house in the town lent him by his old friend
        Shirkov, who had a post in the department of finances and was director
        of a flourishing bank in Kashin; the excellent cook Vronsky had brought
        from the country, and his friendship with the governor, who was a
        schoolfellow of Vronsky&rsquo;s&mdash;a schoolfellow he had patronized
        and protected indeed. But what contributed more than all to his success
        was his direct, equable manner with everyone, which very quickly made
        the majority of the noblemen reverse the current opinion of his supposed
        haughtiness. He was himself conscious that, except that whimsical
        gentleman married to Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, who had
        <i>à propos de bottes</i> poured out a stream of irrelevant absurdities
        with such spiteful fury, every nobleman with whom he had made
        acquaintance had become his adherent. He saw clearly, and other people
        recognized it, too, that he had done a great deal to secure the success
        of Nevyedovsky. And now at his own table, celebrating
        Nevyedovsky&rsquo;s election, he was experiencing an agreeable sense of
        triumph over the success of his candidate. The election itself had so
        fascinated him that, if he could succeed in getting married during the
        next three years, he began to think of standing himself&mdash;much as
        after winning a race ridden by a jockey, he had longed to ride a race
        himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today he was celebrating the success of his jockey. Vronsky sat at the
        head of the table, on his right hand sat the young governor, a general
        of high rank. To all the rest he was the chief man in the province, who
        had solemnly opened the elections with his speech, and aroused a feeling
        of respect and even of awe in many people, as Vronsky saw; to Vronsky he
        was little Katka Maslov&mdash;that had been his nickname in the
        Pages&rsquo; Corps&mdash;whom he felt to be shy and tried to
        <i>mettre à son aise</i>. On the left hand sat Nevyedovsky with his
        youthful, stubborn, and malignant face. With him Vronsky was simple and
        deferential.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sviazhsky took his failure very light-heartedly. It was indeed no
        failure in his eyes, as he said himself, turning, glass in hand, to
        Nevyedovsky; they could not have found a better representative of the
        new movement, which the nobility ought to follow. And so every honest
        person, as he said, was on the side of today&rsquo;s success and was
        rejoicing over it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch was glad, too, that he was having a good time, and
        that everyone was pleased. The episode of the elections served as a good
        occasion for a capital dinner. Sviazhsky comically imitated the tearful
        discourse of the marshal, and observed, addressing Nevyedovsky, that his
        excellency would have to select another more complicated method of
        auditing the accounts than tears. Another nobleman jocosely described
        how footmen in stockings had been ordered for the marshal&rsquo;s ball,
        and how now they would have to be sent back unless the new marshal would
        give a ball with footmen in stockings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Continually during dinner they said of Nevyedovsky: &ldquo;our
        marshal,&rdquo; and &ldquo;your excellency.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This was said with the same pleasure with which a bride is called
        &ldquo;Madame&rdquo; and her husband&rsquo;s name. Nevyedovsky affected
        to be not merely indifferent but scornful of this appellation, but it
        was obvious that he was highly delighted, and had to keep a curb on
        himself not to betray the triumph which was unsuitable to their new
        liberal tone.
      </p>

      <p>
        After dinner several telegrams were sent to people interested in the
        result of the election. And Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was in high good
        humor, sent Darya Alexandrovna a telegram: &ldquo;Nevyedovsky elected by
        twenty votes. Congratulations. Tell people.&rdquo; He dictated it aloud,
        saying: &ldquo;We must let them share our rejoicing.&rdquo; Darya
        Alexandrovna, getting the message, simply sighed over the rouble wasted
        on it, and understood that it was an after-dinner affair. She knew Stiva
        had a weakness after dining for <i>faire jouer le télégraphe.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything, together with the excellent dinner and the wine, not from
        Russian merchants, but imported direct from abroad, was extremely
        dignified, simple, and enjoyable. The party&mdash;some twenty&mdash;had
        been selected by Sviazhsky from among the more active new liberals, all
        of the same way of thinking, who were at the same time clever and well
        bred. They drank, also half in jest, to the health of the new marshal of
        the province, of the governor, of the bank director, and of &ldquo;our
        amiable host.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky was satisfied. He had never expected to find so pleasant a tone
        in the provinces.
      </p>

      <p>
        Towards the end of dinner it was still more lively. The governor asked
        Vronsky to come to a concert for the benefit of the Servians which his
        wife, who was anxious to make his acquaintance, had been getting up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a ball, and you&rsquo;ll see the belle of the
        province. Worth seeing, really.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not in my line,&rdquo; Vronsky answered. He liked that English
        phrase. But he smiled, and promised to come.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before they rose from the table, when all of them were smoking,
        Vronsky&rsquo;s valet went up to him with a letter on a tray.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;From Vozdvizhenskoe by special messenger,&rdquo; he said with a
        significant expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Astonishing! how like he is to the deputy prosecutor
        Sventitsky,&rdquo; said one of the guests in French of the valet, while
        Vronsky, frowning, read the letter.
      </p>

      <p>
        The letter was from Anna. Before he read the letter, he knew its
        contents. Expecting the elections to be over in five days, he had
        promised to be back on Friday. Today was Saturday, and he knew that the
        letter contained reproaches for not being back at the time fixed. The
        letter he had sent the previous evening had probably not reached her
        yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        The letter was what he had expected, but the form of it was unexpected,
        and particularly disagreeable to him. &ldquo;Annie is very ill, the
        doctor says it may be inflammation. I am losing my head all alone.
        Princess Varvara is no help, but a hindrance. I expected you the day
        before yesterday, and yesterday, and now I am sending to find out where
        you are and what you are doing. I wanted to come myself, but thought
        better of it, knowing you would dislike it. Send some answer, that I may
        know what to do.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The child ill, yet she had thought of coming herself. Their daughter
        ill, and this hostile tone.
      </p>

      <p>
        The innocent festivities over the election, and this gloomy, burdensome
        love to which he had to return struck Vronsky by their contrast. But he
        had to go, and by the first train that night he set off home.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 32</h3>

      <p>
        Before Vronsky&rsquo;s departure for the elections, Anna had reflected
        that the scenes constantly repeated between them each time he left home,
        might only make him cold to her instead of attaching him to her, and
        resolved to do all she could to control herself so as to bear the
        parting with composure. But the cold, severe glance with which he had
        looked at her when he came to tell her he was going had wounded her, and
        before he had started her peace of mind was destroyed.
      </p>

      <p>
        In solitude afterwards, thinking over that glance which had expressed
        his right to freedom, she came, as she always did, to the same
        point&mdash;the sense of her own humiliation. &ldquo;He has the right to
        go away when and where he chooses. Not simply to go away, but to leave
        me. He has every right, and I have none. But knowing that, he ought not
        to do it. What has he done, though?... He looked at me with a cold,
        severe expression. Of course that is something indefinable, impalpable,
        but it has never been so before, and that glance means a great
        deal,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;That glance shows the beginning of
        indifference.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And though she felt sure that a coldness was beginning, there was
        nothing she could do, she could not in any way alter her relations to
        him. Just as before, only by love and by charm could she keep him. And
        so, just as before, only by occupation in the day, by morphine at night,
        could she stifle the fearful thought of what would be if he ceased to
        love her. It is true there was still one means; not to keep
        him&mdash;for that she wanted nothing more than his love&mdash;but to be
        nearer to him, to be in such a position that he would not leave her.
        That means was divorce and marriage. And she began to long for that, and
        made up her mind to agree to it the first time he or Stiva approached
        her on the subject.
      </p>

      <p>
        Absorbed in such thoughts, she passed five days without him, the five
        days that he was to be at the elections.
      </p>

      <p>
        Walks, conversation with Princess Varvara, visits to the hospital, and,
        most of all, reading&mdash;reading of one book after
        another&mdash;filled up her time. But on the sixth day, when the
        coachman came back without him, she felt that now she was utterly
        incapable of stifling the thought of him and of what he was doing there,
        just at that time her little girl was taken ill. Anna began to look
        after her, but even that did not distract her mind, especially as the
        illness was not serious. However hard she tried, she could not love this
        little child, and to feign love was beyond her powers. Towards the
        evening of that day, still alone, Anna was in such a panic about him
        that she decided to start for the town, but on second thoughts wrote him
        the contradictory letter that Vronsky received, and without reading it
        through, sent it off by a special messenger. The next morning she
        received his letter and regretted her own. She dreaded a repetition of
        the severe look he had flung at her at parting, especially when he knew
        that the baby was not dangerously ill. But still she was glad she had
        written to him. At this moment Anna was positively admitting to herself
        that she was a burden to him, that he would relinquish his freedom
        regretfully to return to her, and in spite of that she was glad he was
        coming. Let him weary of her, but he would be here with her, so that she
        would see him, would know of every action he took.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was sitting in the drawing-room near a lamp, with a new volume of
        Taine, and as she read, listening to the sound of the wind outside, and
        every minute expecting the carriage to arrive. Several times she had
        fancied she heard the sound of wheels, but she had been mistaken. At
        last she heard not the sound of wheels, but the coachman&rsquo;s shout
        and the dull rumble in the covered entry. Even Princess Varvara, playing
        patience, confirmed this, and Anna, flushing hotly, got up; but instead
        of going down, as she had done twice before, she stood still. She
        suddenly felt ashamed of her duplicity, but even more she dreaded how he
        might meet her. All feeling of wounded pride had passed now; she was
        only afraid of the expression of his displeasure. She remembered that
        her child had been perfectly well again for the last two days. She felt
        positively vexed with her for getting better from the very moment her
        letter was sent off. Then she thought of him, that he was here, all of
        him, with his hands, his eyes. She heard his voice. And forgetting
        everything, she ran joyfully to meet him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, how is Annie?&rdquo; he said timidly from below, looking up
        to Anna as she ran down to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was sitting on a chair, and a footman was pulling off his warm
        over-boot.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, she is better.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; he said, shaking himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        She took his hand in both of hers, and drew it to her waist, never
        taking her eyes off him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; he said, coldly scanning her, her
        hair, her dress, which he knew she had put on for him. All was charming,
        but how many times it had charmed him! And the stern, stony expression
        that she so dreaded settled upon his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad. And are you well?&rdquo; he said, wiping
        his damp beard with his handkerchief and kissing her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;only let him be here, and
        so long as he&rsquo;s here he cannot, he dare not, cease to love
        me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The evening was spent happily and gaily in the presence of Princess
        Varvara, who complained to him that Anna had been taking morphine in his
        absence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What am I to do? I couldn&rsquo;t sleep.... My thoughts prevented
        me. When he&rsquo;s here I never take it&mdash;hardly ever.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He told her about the election, and Anna knew how by adroit questions to
        bring him to what gave him most pleasure&mdash;his own success. She told
        him of everything that interested him at home; and all that she told him
        was of the most cheerful description.
      </p>

      <p>
        But late in the evening, when they were alone, Anna, seeing that she had
        regained complete possession of him, wanted to erase the painful
        impression of the glance he had given her for her letter. She said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell me frankly, you were vexed at getting my letter, and you
        didn&rsquo;t believe me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as she had said it, she felt that however warm his feelings were
        to her, he had not forgiven her for that.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the letter was so strange. First,
        Annie ill, and then you thought of coming yourself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It was all the truth.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t doubt it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you do doubt it. You are vexed, I see.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not for one moment. I&rsquo;m only vexed, that&rsquo;s true, that
        you seem somehow unwilling to admit that there are duties....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The duty of going to a concert....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t talk about it,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why not talk about it?&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I only meant to say that matters of real importance may turn up.
        Now, for instance, I shall have to go to Moscow to arrange about the
        house.... Oh, Anna, why are you so irritable? Don&rsquo;t you know that
        I can&rsquo;t live without you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If so,&rdquo; said Anna, her voice suddenly changing, &ldquo;it
        means that you are sick of this life.... Yes, you will come for a day
        and go away, as men do....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna, that&rsquo;s cruel. I am ready to give up my whole
        life.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But she did not hear him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If you go to Moscow, I will go too. I will not stay here. Either
        we must separate or else live together.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, you know, that&rsquo;s my one desire. But for
        that....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We must get a divorce. I will write to him. I see I cannot go on
        like this.... But I will come with you to Moscow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You talk as if you were threatening me. But I desire nothing so
        much as never to be parted from you,&rdquo; said Vronsky, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        But as he said these words there gleamed in his eyes not merely a cold
        look, but the vindictive look of a man persecuted and made cruel.
      </p>

      <p>
        She saw the look and correctly divined its meaning.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If so, it&rsquo;s a calamity!&rdquo; that glance told her. It was
        a moment&rsquo;s impression, but she never forgot it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna wrote to her husband asking him about a divorce, and towards the
        end of November, taking leave of Princess Varvara, who wanted to go to
        Petersburg, she went with Vronsky to Moscow. Expecting every day an
        answer from Alexey Alexandrovitch, and after that the divorce, they now
        established themselves together like married people.

      <h2>PART SEVEN</h2>

      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>

      <p>
        The Levins had been three months in Moscow. The date had long passed on
        which, according to the most trustworthy calculations of people learned
        in such matters, Kitty should have been confined. But she was still
        about, and there was nothing to show that her time was any nearer than
        two months ago. The doctor, the monthly nurse, and Dolly and her mother,
        and most of all Levin, who could not think of the approaching event
        without terror, began to be impatient and uneasy. Kitty was the only
        person who felt perfectly calm and happy.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was distinctly conscious now of the birth of a new feeling of love
        for the future child, for her to some extent actually existing already,
        and she brooded blissfully over this feeling. He was not by now
        altogether a part of herself, but sometimes lived his own life
        independently of her. Often this separate being gave her pain, but at
        the same time she wanted to laugh with a strange new joy.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the people she loved were with her, and all were so good to her, so
        attentively caring for her, so entirely pleasant was everything
        presented to her, that if she had not known and felt that it must all
        soon be over, she could not have wished for a better and pleasanter
        life. The only thing that spoiled the charm of this manner of life was
        that her husband was not here as she loved him to be, and as he was in
        the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        She liked his serene, friendly, and hospitable manner in the country. In
        the town he seemed continually uneasy and on his guard, as though he
        were afraid someone would be rude to him, and still more to her. At home
        in the country, knowing himself distinctly to be in his right place, he
        was never in haste to be off elsewhere. He was never unoccupied. Here in
        town he was in a continual hurry, as though afraid of missing something,
        and yet he had nothing to do. And she felt sorry for him. To others, she
        knew, he did not appear an object of pity. On the contrary, when Kitty
        looked at him in society, as one sometimes looks at those one loves,
        trying to see him as if he were a stranger, so as to catch the
        impression he must make on others, she saw with a panic even of jealous
        fear that he was far indeed from being a pitiable figure, that he was
        very attractive with his fine breeding, his rather old-fashioned,
        reserved courtesy with women, his powerful figure, and striking, as she
        thought, and expressive face. But she saw him not from without, but from
        within; she saw that here he was not himself; that was the only way she
        could define his condition to herself. Sometimes she inwardly reproached
        him for his inability to live in the town; sometimes she recognized that
        it was really hard for him to order his life here so that he could be
        satisfied with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        What had he to do, indeed? He did not care for cards; he did not go to a
        club. Spending the time with jovial gentlemen of Oblonsky&rsquo;s
        type&mdash;she knew now what that meant ... it meant drinking and going
        somewhere after drinking. She could not think without horror of where
        men went on such occasions. Was he to go into society? But she knew he
        could only find satisfaction in that if he took pleasure in the society
        of young women, and that she could not wish for. Should he stay at home
        with her, her mother and her sisters? But much as she liked and enjoyed
        their conversations forever on the same
        subjects&mdash;&ldquo;Aline-Nadine,&rdquo; as the old prince called the
        sisters&rsquo; talks&mdash;she knew it must bore him. What was there
        left for him to do? To go on writing at his book he had indeed
        attempted, and at first he used to go to the library and make extracts
        and look up references for his book. But, as he told her, the more he
        did nothing, the less time he had to do anything. And besides, he
        complained that he had talked too much about his book here, and that
        consequently all his ideas about it were muddled and had lost their
        interest for him.
      </p>

      <p>
        One advantage in this town life was that quarrels hardly ever happened
        between them here in town. Whether it was that their conditions were
        different, or that they had both become more careful and sensible in
        that respect, they had no quarrels in Moscow from jealousy, which they
        had so dreaded when they moved from the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        One event, an event of great importance to both from that point of view,
        did indeed happen&mdash;that was Kitty&rsquo;s meeting with Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        The old Princess Marya Borissovna, Kitty&rsquo;s godmother, who had
        always been very fond of her, had insisted on seeing her. Kitty, though
        she did not go into society at all on account of her condition, went
        with her father to see the venerable old lady, and there met Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only thing Kitty could reproach herself for at this meeting was that
        at the instant when she recognized in his civilian dress the features
        once so familiar to her, her breath failed her, the blood rushed to her
        heart, and a vivid blush&mdash;she felt it&mdash;overspread her face.
        But this lasted only a few seconds. Before her father, who purposely
        began talking in a loud voice to Vronsky, had finished, she was
        perfectly ready to look at Vronsky, to speak to him, if necessary,
        exactly as she spoke to Princess Marya Borissovna, and more than that,
        to do so in such a way that everything to the faintest intonation and
        smile would have been approved by her husband, whose unseen presence she
        seemed to feel about her at that instant.
      </p>

      <p>
        She said a few words to him, even smiled serenely at his joke about the
        elections, which he called &ldquo;our parliament.&rdquo; (She had to
        smile to show she saw the joke.) But she turned away immediately to
        Princess Marya Borissovna, and did not once glance at him till he got up
        to go; then she looked at him, but evidently only because it would be
        uncivil not to look at a man when he is saying good-bye.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was grateful to her father for saying nothing to her about their
        meeting Vronsky, but she saw by his special warmth to her after the
        visit during their usual walk that he was pleased with her. She was
        pleased with herself. She had not expected she would have had the power,
        while keeping somewhere in the bottom of her heart all the memories of
        her old feeling for Vronsky, not only to seem but to be perfectly
        indifferent and composed with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin flushed a great deal more than she when she told him she had met
        Vronsky at Princess Marya Borissovna&rsquo;s. It was very hard for her
        to tell him this, but still harder to go on speaking of the details of
        the meeting, as he did not question her, but simply gazed at her with a
        frown.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very sorry you weren&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; she said.
        &ldquo;Not that you weren&rsquo;t in the room ... I couldn&rsquo;t have
        been so natural in your presence ... I am blushing now much more, much,
        much more,&rdquo; she said, blushing till the tears came into her eyes.
        &ldquo;But that you couldn&rsquo;t see through a crack.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The truthful eyes told Levin that she was satisfied with herself, and in
        spite of her blushing he was quickly reassured and began questioning
        her, which was all she wanted. When he had heard everything, even to the
        detail that for the first second she could not help flushing, but that
        afterwards she was just as direct and as much at her ease as with any
        chance acquaintance, Levin was quite happy again and said he was glad of
        it, and would not now behave as stupidly as he had done at the election,
        but would try the first time he met Vronsky to be as friendly as
        possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so wretched to feel that there&rsquo;s a man almost an
        enemy whom it&rsquo;s painful to meet,&rdquo; said Levin.
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very, very glad.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Go, please, go then and call on the Bols,&rdquo; Kitty said to
        her husband, when he came in to see her at eleven o&rsquo;clock before
        going out. &ldquo;I know you are dining at the club; papa put down your
        name. But what are you going to do in the morning?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am only going to Katavasov,&rdquo; answered Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so early?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He promised to introduce me to Metrov. I wanted to talk to him
        about my work. He&rsquo;s a distinguished scientific man from
        Petersburg,&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; wasn&rsquo;t it his article you were praising so? Well, and
        after that?&rdquo; said Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall go to the court, perhaps, about my sister&rsquo;s
        business.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And the concert?&rdquo; she queried.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t go there all alone.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No? do go; there are going to be some new things.... That
        interested you so. I should certainly go.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, anyway, I shall come home before dinner,&rdquo; he said,
        looking at his watch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Put on your frock coat, so that you can go straight to call on
        Countess Bola.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But is it absolutely necessary?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, absolutely! He has been to see us. Come, what is it? You go
        in, sit down, talk for five minutes of the weather, get up and go
        away.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe it! I&rsquo;ve got so out of the
        way of all this that it makes me feel positively ashamed. It&rsquo;s
        such a horrible thing to do! A complete outsider walks in, sits down,
        stays on with nothing to do, wastes their time and worries himself, and
        walks away!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty laughed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, I suppose you used to pay calls before you were married,
        didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I did, but I always felt ashamed, and now I&rsquo;m so out
        of the way of it that, by Jove! I&rsquo;d sooner go two days running
        without my dinner than pay this call! One&rsquo;s so ashamed! I feel all
        the while that they&rsquo;re annoyed, that they&rsquo;re saying,
        &lsquo;What has he come for?&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, they won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll answer for that,&rdquo; said
        Kitty, looking into his face with a laugh. She took his hand.
        &ldquo;Well, good-bye.... Do go, please.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He was just going out after kissing his wife&rsquo;s hand, when she
        stopped him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kostya, do you know I&rsquo;ve only fifty roubles left?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, all right, I&rsquo;ll go to the bank and get some. How
        much?&rdquo; he said, with the expression of dissatisfaction she knew so
        well.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, wait a minute.&rdquo; She held his hand. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
        talk about it, it worries me. I seem to spend nothing unnecessary, but
        money seems to fly away simply. We don&rsquo;t manage well,
        somehow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said with a little cough,
        looking at her from under his brows.
      </p>

      <p>
        That cough she knew well. It was a sign of intense dissatisfaction, not
        with her, but with himself. He certainly was displeased not at so much
        money being spent, but at being reminded of what he, knowing something
        was unsatisfactory, wanted to forget.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have told Sokolov to sell the wheat, and to borrow an advance
        on the mill. We shall have money enough in any case.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m afraid that altogether....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right, all right,&rdquo; he repeated.
        &ldquo;Well, good-bye, darling.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m really sorry sometimes that I listened to mamma.
        How nice it would have been in the country! As it is, I&rsquo;m worrying
        you all, and we&rsquo;re wasting our money.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not at all, not at all. Not once since I&rsquo;ve been married
        have I said that things could have been better than they are....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Truly?&rdquo; she said, looking into his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had said it without thinking, simply to console her. But when he
        glanced at her and saw those sweet truthful eyes fastened questioningly
        on him, he repeated it with his whole heart. &ldquo;I was positively
        forgetting her,&rdquo; he thought. And he remembered what was before
        them, so soon to come.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Will it be soon? How do you feel?&rdquo; he whispered, taking her
        two hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have so often thought so, that now I don&rsquo;t think about it
        or know anything about it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re not frightened?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She smiled contemptuously.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not the least little bit,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, if anything happens, I shall be at
        Katavasov&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, nothing will happen, and don&rsquo;t think about it.
        I&rsquo;m going for a walk on the boulevard with papa. We&rsquo;re going
        to see Dolly. I shall expect you before dinner. Oh, yes! Do you know
        that Dolly&rsquo;s position is becoming utterly impossible? She&rsquo;s
        in debt all round; she hasn&rsquo;t a penny. We were talking yesterday
        with mamma and Arseny&rdquo; (this was her sister&rsquo;s husband Lvov),
        &ldquo;and we determined to send you with him to talk to Stiva.
        It&rsquo;s really unbearable. One can&rsquo;t speak to papa about it....
        But if you and he....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, what can we do?&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be at Arseny&rsquo;s, anyway; talk to him, he will
        tell what we decided.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I agree to everything Arseny thinks beforehand. I&rsquo;ll go
        and see him. By the way, if I do go to the concert, I&rsquo;ll go with
        Natalia. Well, good-bye.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        On the steps Levin was stopped by his old servant Kouzma, who had been
        with him before his marriage, and now looked after their household in
        town.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Beauty&rdquo; (that was the left shaft-horse brought up from the
        country) &ldquo;has been badly shod and is quite lame,&rdquo; he said.
        &ldquo;What does your honor wish to be done?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        During the first part of their stay in Moscow, Levin had used his own
        horses brought up from the country. He had tried to arrange this part of
        their expenses in the best and cheapest way possible; but it appeared
        that their own horses came dearer than hired horses, and they still
        hired too.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Send for the veterinary, there may be a bruise.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And for Katerina Alexandrovna?&rdquo; asked Kouzma.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin was not by now struck as he had been at first by the fact that to
        get from one end of Moscow to the other he had to have two powerful
        horses put into a heavy carriage, to take the carriage three miles
        through the snowy slush and to keep it standing there four hours, paying
        five roubles every time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now it seemed quite natural.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Hire a pair for our carriage from the jobmaster,&rdquo; said he.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And so, simply and easily, thanks to the facilities of town life, Levin
        settled a question which, in the country, would have called for so much
        personal trouble and exertion, and going out onto the steps, he called a
        sledge, sat down, and drove to Nikitsky. On the way he thought no more
        of money, but mused on the introduction that awaited him to the
        Petersburg savant, a writer on sociology, and what he would say to him
        about his book.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only during the first days of his stay in Moscow Levin had been struck
        by the expenditure, strange to one living in the country, unproductive
        but inevitable, that was expected of him on every side. But by now he
        had grown used to it. That had happened to him in this matter which is
        said to happen to drunkards&mdash;the first glass sticks in the throat,
        the second flies down like a hawk, but after the third they&rsquo;re
        like tiny little birds. When Levin had changed his first hundred-rouble
        note to pay for liveries for his footmen and hall-porter he could not
        help reflecting that these liveries were of no use to anyone&mdash;but
        they were indubitably necessary, to judge by the amazement of the
        princess and Kitty when he suggested that they might do without
        liveries,&mdash;that these liveries would cost the wages of two laborers
        for the summer, that is, would pay for about three hundred working days
        from Easter to Ash Wednesday, and each a day of hard work from early
        morning to late evening&mdash;and that hundred-rouble note did stick in
        his throat. But the next note, changed to pay for providing a dinner for
        their relations, that cost twenty-eight roubles, though it did excite in
        Levin the reflection that twenty-eight roubles meant nine measures of
        oats, which men would with groans and sweat have reaped and bound and
        thrashed and winnowed and sifted and sown,&mdash;this next one he parted
        with more easily. And now the notes he changed no longer aroused such
        reflections, and they flew off like little birds. Whether the labor
        devoted to obtaining the money corresponded to the pleasure given by
        what was bought with it, was a consideration he had long ago dismissed.
        His business calculation that there was a certain price below which he
        could not sell certain grain was forgotten too. The rye, for the price
        of which he had so long held out, had been sold for fifty kopecks a
        measure cheaper than it had been fetching a month ago. Even the
        consideration that with such an expenditure he could not go on living
        for a year without debt, that even had no force. Only one thing was
        essential: to have money in the bank, without inquiring where it came
        from, so as to know that one had the wherewithal to buy meat for
        tomorrow. And this condition had hitherto been fulfilled; he had always
        had the money in the bank. But now the money in the bank had gone, and
        he could not quite tell where to get the next installment. And this it
        was which, at the moment when Kitty had mentioned money, had disturbed
        him; but he had no time to think about it. He drove off, thinking of
        Katavasov and the meeting with Metrov that was before him.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 3</h3>

      <p>
        Levin had on this visit to town seen a great deal of his old friend at
        the university, Professor Katavasov, whom he had not seen since his
        marriage. He liked in Katavasov the clearness and simplicity of his
        conception of life. Levin thought that the clearness of
        Katavasov&rsquo;s conception of life was due to the poverty of his
        nature; Katavasov thought that the disconnectedness of Levin&rsquo;s
        ideas was due to his lack of intellectual discipline; but Levin enjoyed
        Katavasov&rsquo;s clearness, and Katavasov enjoyed the abundance of
        Levin&rsquo;s untrained ideas, and they liked to meet and to discuss.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin had read Katavasov some parts of his book, and he had liked them.
        On the previous day Katavasov had met Levin at a public lecture and told
        him that the celebrated Metrov, whose article Levin had so much liked,
        was in Moscow, that he had been much interested by what Katavasov had
        told him about Levin&rsquo;s work, and that he was coming to see him
        tomorrow at eleven, and would be very glad to make Levin&rsquo;s
        acquaintance.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re positively a reformed character, I&rsquo;m glad to
        see,&rdquo; said Katavasov, meeting Levin in the little drawing-room.
        &ldquo;I heard the bell and thought: Impossible that it can be he at the
        exact time!... Well, what do you say to the Montenegrins now?
        They&rsquo;re a race of warriors.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; asked Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Katavasov in a few words told him the last piece of news from the war,
        and going into his study, introduced Levin to a short, thick-set man of
        pleasant appearance. This was Metrov. The conversation touched for a
        brief space on politics and on how recent events were looked at in the
        higher spheres in Petersburg. Metrov repeated a saying that had reached
        him through a most trustworthy source, reported as having been uttered
        on this subject by the Tsar and one of the ministers. Katavasov had
        heard also on excellent authority that the Tsar had said something quite
        different. Levin tried to imagine circumstances in which both sayings
        might have been uttered, and the conversation on that topic dropped.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, here he&rsquo;s written almost a book on the natural
        conditions of the laborer in relation to the land,&rdquo; said
        Katavasov; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a specialist, but I, as a natural
        science man, was pleased at his not taking mankind as something outside
        biological laws; but, on the contrary, seeing his dependence on his
        surroundings, and in that dependence seeking the laws of his
        development.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very interesting,&rdquo; said Metrov.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What I began precisely was to write a book on agriculture; but
        studying the chief instrument of agriculture, the laborer,&rdquo; said
        Levin, reddening, &ldquo;I could not help coming to quite unexpected
        results.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Levin began carefully, as it were, feeling his ground, to expound
        his views. He knew Metrov had written an article against the generally
        accepted theory of political economy, but to what extent he could reckon
        on his sympathy with his own new views he did not know and could not
        guess from the clever and serene face of the learned man.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But in what do you see the special characteristics of the Russian
        laborer?&rdquo; said Metrov; &ldquo;in his biological characteristics,
        so to speak, or in the condition in which he is placed?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin saw that there was an idea underlying this question with which he
        did not agree. But he went on explaining his own idea that the Russian
        laborer has a quite special view of the land, different from that of
        other people; and to support this proposition he made haste to add that
        in his opinion this attitude of the Russian peasant was due to the
        consciousness of his vocation to people vast unoccupied expanses in the
        East.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;One may easily be led into error in basing any conclusion on the
        general vocation of a people,&rdquo; said Metrov, interrupting Levin.
        &ldquo;The condition of the laborer will always depend on his relation
        to the land and to capital.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And without letting Levin finish explaining his idea, Metrov began
        expounding to him the special point of his own theory.
      </p>

      <p>
        In what the point of his theory lay, Levin did not understand, because
        he did not take the trouble to understand. He saw that Metrov, like
        other people, in spite of his own article, in which he had attacked the
        current theory of political economy, looked at the position of the
        Russian peasant simply from the point of view of capital, wages, and
        rent. He would indeed have been obliged to admit that in the
        eastern&mdash;much the larger&mdash;part of Russia rent was as yet nil,
        that for nine-tenths of the eighty millions of the Russian peasants
        wages took the form simply of food provided for themselves, and that
        capital does not so far exist except in the form of the most primitive
        tools. Yet it was only from that point of view that he considered every
        laborer, though in many points he differed from the economists and had
        his own theory of the wage-fund, which he expounded to Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin listened reluctantly, and at first made objections. He would have
        liked to interrupt Metrov, to explain his own thought, which in his
        opinion would have rendered further exposition of Metrov&rsquo;s
        theories superfluous. But later on, feeling convinced that they looked
        at the matter so differently, that they could never understand one
        another, he did not even oppose his statements, but simply listened.
        Although what Metrov was saying was by now utterly devoid of interest
        for him, he yet experienced a certain satisfaction in listening to him.
        It flattered his vanity that such a learned man should explain his ideas
        to him so eagerly, with such intensity and confidence in Levin&rsquo;s
        understanding of the subject, sometimes with a mere hint referring him
        to a whole aspect of the subject. He put this down to his own credit,
        unaware that Metrov, who had already discussed his theory over and over
        again with all his intimate friends, talked of it with special eagerness
        to every new person, and in general was eager to talk to anyone of any
        subject that interested him, even if still obscure to himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We are late though,&rdquo; said Katavasov, looking at his watch
        directly Metrov had finished his discourse.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a meeting of the Society of Amateurs today in
        commemoration of the jubilee of Svintitch,&rdquo; said Katavasov in
        answer to Levin&rsquo;s inquiry. &ldquo;Pyotr Ivanovitch and I were
        going. I&rsquo;ve promised to deliver an address on his labors in
        zoology. Come along with us, it&rsquo;s very interesting.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, and indeed it&rsquo;s time to start,&rdquo; said Metrov.
        &ldquo;Come with us, and from there, if you care to, come to my place. I
        should very much like to hear your work.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no! It&rsquo;s no good yet, it&rsquo;s unfinished. But I
        shall be very glad to go to the meeting.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I say, friends, have you heard? He has handed in the separate
        report,&rdquo; Katavasov called from the other room, where he was
        putting on his frock coat.
      </p>

      <p>
        And a conversation sprang up upon the university question, which was a
        very important event that winter in Moscow. Three old professors in the
        council had not accepted the opinion of the younger professors. The
        young ones had registered a separate resolution. This, in the judgment
        of some people, was monstrous, in the judgment of others it was the
        simplest and most just thing to do, and the professors were split up
        into two parties.
      </p>

      <p>
        One party, to which Katavasov belonged, saw in the opposite party a
        scoundrelly betrayal and treachery, while the opposite party saw in them
        childishness and lack of respect for the authorities. Levin, though he
        did not belong to the university, had several times already during his
        stay in Moscow heard and talked about this matter, and had his own
        opinion on the subject. He took part in the conversation that was
        continued in the street, as they all three walked to the buildings of
        the old university.
      </p>

      <p>
        The meeting had already begun. Round the cloth-covered table, at which
        Katavasov and Metrov seated themselves, there were some half-dozen
        persons, and one of these was bending close over a manuscript, reading
        something aloud. Levin sat down in one of the empty chairs that were
        standing round the table, and in a whisper asked a student sitting near
        what was being read. The student, eyeing Levin with displeasure, said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Biography.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Though Levin was not interested in the biography, he could not help
        listening, and learned some new and interesting facts about the life of
        the distinguished man of science.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the reader had finished, the chairman thanked him and read some
        verses of the poet Ment sent him on the jubilee, and said a few words by
        way of thanks to the poet. Then Katavasov in his loud, ringing voice
        read his address on the scientific labors of the man whose jubilee was
        being kept.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Katavasov had finished, Levin looked at his watch, saw it was past
        one, and thought that there would not be time before the concert to read
        Metrov his book, and indeed, he did not now care to do so. During the
        reading he had thought over their conversation. He saw distinctly now
        that though Metrov&rsquo;s ideas might perhaps have value, his own ideas
        had a value too, and their ideas could only be made clear and lead to
        something if each worked separately in his chosen path, and that nothing
        would be gained by putting their ideas together. And having made up his
        mind to refuse Metrov&rsquo;s invitation, Levin went up to him at the
        end of the meeting. Metrov introduced Levin to the chairman, with whom
        he was talking of the political news. Metrov told the chairman what he
        had already told Levin, and Levin made the same remarks on his news that
        he had already made that morning, but for the sake of variety he
        expressed also a new opinion which had only just struck him. After that
        the conversation turned again on the university question. As Levin had
        already heard it all, he made haste to tell Metrov that he was sorry he
        could not take advantage of his invitation, took leave, and drove to
        Lvov&rsquo;s.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 4</h3>

      <p>
        Lvov, the husband of Natalia, Kitty&rsquo;s sister, had spent all his
        life in foreign capitals, where he had been educated, and had been in
        the diplomatic service.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the previous year he had left the diplomatic service, not owing
        to any &ldquo;unpleasantness&rdquo; (he never had any
        &ldquo;unpleasantness&rdquo; with anyone), and was transferred to the
        department of the court of the palace in Moscow, in order to give his
        two boys the best education possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        In spite of the striking contrast in their habits and views and the fact
        that Lvov was older than Levin, they had seen a great deal of one
        another that winter, and had taken a great liking to each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lvov was at home, and Levin went in to him unannounced.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lvov, in a house coat with a belt and in chamois leather shoes, was
        sitting in an armchair, and with a pince-nez with blue glasses he was
        reading a book that stood on a reading desk, while in his beautiful hand
        he held a half-burned cigarette daintily away from him.
      </p>

      <p>
        His handsome, delicate, and still youthful-looking face, to which his
        curly, glistening silvery hair gave a still more aristocratic air,
        lighted up with a smile when he saw Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Capital! I was meaning to send to you. How&rsquo;s Kitty? Sit
        here, it&rsquo;s more comfortable.&rdquo; He got up and pushed up a
        rocking chair. &ldquo;Have you read the last circular in the
        <i>Journal de St. Pétersbourg?</i> I think it&rsquo;s excellent,&rdquo;
        he said, with a slight French accent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin told him what he had heard from Katavasov was being said in
        Petersburg, and after talking a little about politics, he told him of
        his interview with Metrov, and the learned society&rsquo;s meeting. To
        Lvov it was very interesting.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I envy you, that you are able to mix in these
        interesting scientific circles,&rdquo; he said. And as he talked, he
        passed as usual into French, which was easier to him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
        true I haven&rsquo;t the time for it. My official work and the children
        leave me no time; and then I&rsquo;m not ashamed to own that my
        education has been too defective.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; said Levin with a smile,
        feeling, as he always did, touched at Lvov&rsquo;s low opinion of
        himself, which was not in the least put on from a desire to seem or to
        be modest, but was absolutely sincere.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed! I feel now how badly educated I am. To educate
        my children I positively have to look up a great deal, and in fact
        simply to study myself. For it&rsquo;s not enough to have teachers,
        there must be someone to look after them, just as on your land you want
        laborers and an overseer. See what I&rsquo;m reading&rdquo;&mdash;he
        pointed to Buslaev&rsquo;s
        <i>Grammar</i> on the desk&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s expected of Misha,
        and it&rsquo;s so difficult.... Come, explain to me.... Here he
        says....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin tried to explain to him that it couldn&rsquo;t be understood, but
        that it had to be taught; but Lvov would not agree with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re laughing at it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;On the contrary, you can&rsquo;t imagine how, when I look at you,
        I&rsquo;m always learning the task that lies before me, that is the
        education of one&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing for you to learn,&rdquo; said Lvov.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All I know,&rdquo; said Levin, &ldquo;is that I have never seen
        better brought-up children than yours, and I wouldn&rsquo;t wish for
        children better than yours.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Lvov visibly tried to restrain the expression of his delight, but he was
        positively radiant with smiles.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If only they&rsquo;re better than I! That&rsquo;s all I desire.
        You don&rsquo;t know yet all the work,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with boys
        who&rsquo;ve been left like mine to run wild abroad.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch all that up. They&rsquo;re such clever
        children. The great thing is the education of character. That&rsquo;s
        what I learn when I look at your children.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You talk of the education of character. You can&rsquo;t imagine
        how difficult that is! You have hardly succeeded in combating one
        tendency when others crop up, and the struggle begins again. If one had
        not a support in religion&mdash;you remember we talked about
        that&mdash;no father could bring children up relying on his own strength
        alone without that help.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This subject, which always interested Levin, was cut short by the
        entrance of the beauty Natalia Alexandrovna, dressed to go out.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were here,&rdquo; she said, unmistakably
        feeling no regret, but a positive pleasure, in interrupting this
        conversation on a topic she had heard so much of that she was by now
        weary of it. &ldquo;Well, how is Kitty? I am dining with you today. I
        tell you what, Arseny,&rdquo; she turned to her husband, &ldquo;you take
        the carriage.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And the husband and wife began to discuss their arrangements for the
        day. As the husband had to drive to meet someone on official business,
        while the wife had to go to the concert and some public meeting of a
        committee on the Eastern Question, there was a great deal to consider
        and settle. Levin had to take part in their plans as one of themselves.
        It was settled that Levin should go with Natalia to the concert and the
        meeting, and that from there they should send the carriage to the office
        for Arseny, and he should call for her and take her to Kitty&rsquo;s; or
        that, if he had not finished his work, he should send the carriage back
        and Levin would go with her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s spoiling me,&rdquo; Lvov said to his wife; &ldquo;he
        assures me that our children are splendid, when I know how much
        that&rsquo;s bad there is in them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Arseny goes to extremes, I always say,&rdquo; said his wife.
        &ldquo;If you look for perfection, you will never be satisfied. And
        it&rsquo;s true, as papa says,&mdash;that when we were brought up there
        was one extreme&mdash;we were kept in the basement, while our parents
        lived in the best rooms; now it&rsquo;s just the other way&mdash;the
        parents are in the wash house, while the children are in the best rooms.
        Parents now are not expected to live at all, but to exist altogether for
        their children.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what if they like it better?&rdquo; Lvov said, with his
        beautiful smile, touching her hand. &ldquo;Anyone who didn&rsquo;t know
        you would think you were a stepmother, not a true mother.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, extremes are not good in anything,&rdquo; Natalia said
        serenely, putting his paper-knife straight in its proper place on the
        table.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, come here, you perfect children,&rdquo; Lvov said to the
        two handsome boys who came in, and after bowing to Levin, went up to
        their father, obviously wishing to ask him about something.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin would have liked to talk to them, to hear what they would say to
        their father, but Natalia began talking to him, and then Lvov&rsquo;s
        colleague in the service, Mahotin, walked in, wearing his court uniform,
        to go with him to meet someone, and a conversation was kept up without a
        break upon Herzegovina, Princess Korzinskaya, the town council, and the
        sudden death of Madame Apraksina.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin even forgot the commission intrusted to him. He recollected it as
        he was going into the hall.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, Kitty told me to talk to you about Oblonsky,&rdquo; he said,
        as Lvov was standing on the stairs, seeing his wife and Levin off.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, maman wants us, <i>les beaux-frères,</i> to attack
        him,&rdquo; he said, blushing. &ldquo;But why should I?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, I will attack him,&rdquo; said Madame Lvova, with a
        smile, standing in her white sheepskin cape, waiting till they had
        finished speaking. &ldquo;Come, let us go.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 5</h3>

      <p>
        At the concert in the afternoon two very interesting things were
        performed. One was a fantasia, <i>King Lear;</i> the other was a
        quartette dedicated to the memory of Bach. Both were new and in the new
        style, and Levin was eager to form an opinion of them. After escorting
        his sister-in-law to her stall, he stood against a column and tried to
        listen as attentively and conscientiously as possible. He tried not to
        let his attention be distracted, and not to spoil his impression by
        looking at the conductor in a white tie, waving his arms, which always
        disturbed his enjoyment of music so much, or the ladies in bonnets, with
        strings carefully tied over their ears, and all these people either
        thinking of nothing at all or thinking of all sorts of things except the
        music. He tried to avoid meeting musical connoisseurs or talkative
        acquaintances, and stood looking at the floor straight before him,
        listening.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the more he listened to the fantasia of <i>King Lear</i> the further
        he felt from forming any definite opinion of it. There was, as it were,
        a continual beginning, a preparation of the musical expression of some
        feeling, but it fell to pieces again directly, breaking into new musical
        motives, or simply nothing but the whims of the composer, exceedingly
        complex but disconnected sounds. And these fragmentary musical
        expressions, though sometimes beautiful, were disagreeable, because they
        were utterly unexpected and not led up to by anything. Gaiety and grief
        and despair and tenderness and triumph followed one another without any
        connection, like the emotions of a madman. And those emotions, like a
        madman&rsquo;s, sprang up quite unexpectedly.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the whole of the performance Levin felt like a deaf man watching
        people dancing, and was in a state of complete bewilderment when the
        fantasia was over, and felt a great weariness from the fruitless strain
        on his attention. Loud applause resounded on all sides. Everyone got up,
        moved about, and began talking. Anxious to throw some light on his own
        perplexity from the impressions of others, Levin began to walk about,
        looking for connoisseurs, and was glad to see a well-known musical
        amateur in conversation with Pestsov, whom he knew.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Marvelous!&rdquo; Pestsov was saying in his mellow bass.
        &ldquo;How are you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch? Particularly sculpturesque
        and plastic, so to say, and richly colored is that passage where you
        feel Cordelia&rsquo;s approach, where woman,
        <i>das ewig Weibliche,</i> enters into conflict with fate. Isn&rsquo;t
        it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You mean ... what has Cordelia to do with it?&rdquo; Levin asked
        timidly, forgetting that the fantasia was supposed to represent King
        Lear.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Cordelia comes in ... see here!&rdquo; said Pestsov, tapping his
        finger on the satiny surface of the program he held in his hand and
        passing it to Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only then Levin recollected the title of the fantasia, and made haste to
        read in the Russian translation the lines from Shakespeare that were
        printed on the back of the program.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t follow it without that,&rdquo; said Pestsov,
        addressing Levin, as the person he had been speaking to had gone away,
        and he had no one to talk to.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the <i>entr&rsquo;acte</i> Levin and Pestsov fell into an argument
        upon the merits and defects of music of the Wagner school. Levin
        maintained that the mistake of Wagner and all his followers lay in their
        trying to take music into the sphere of another art, just as poetry goes
        wrong when it tries to paint a face as the art of painting ought to do,
        and as an instance of this mistake he cited the sculptor who carved in
        marble certain poetic phantasms flitting round the figure of the poet on
        the pedestal. &ldquo;These phantoms were so far from being phantoms that
        they were positively clinging on the ladder,&rdquo; said Levin. The
        comparison pleased him, but he could not remember whether he had not
        used the same phrase before, and to Pestsov, too, and as he said it he
        felt confused.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pestsov maintained that art is one, and that it can attain its highest
        manifestations only by conjunction with all kinds of art.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second piece that was performed Levin could not hear. Pestsov, who
        was standing beside him, was talking to him almost all the time,
        condemning the music for its excessive affected assumption of
        simplicity, and comparing it with the simplicity of the Pre-Raphaelites
        in painting. As he went out Levin met many more acquaintances, with whom
        he talked of politics, of music, and of common acquaintances. Among
        others he met Count Bol, whom he had utterly forgotten to call upon.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, go at once then,&rdquo; Madame Lvova said, when he told
        her; &ldquo;perhaps they&rsquo;ll not be at home, and then you can come
        to the meeting to fetch me. You&rsquo;ll find me still there.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 6</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;re not at home?&rdquo; said Levin, as he went
        into the hall of Countess Bola&rsquo;s house.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;At home; please walk in,&rdquo; said the porter, resolutely
        removing his overcoat.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How annoying!&rdquo; thought Levin with a sigh, taking off one
        glove and stroking his hat. &ldquo;What did I come for? What have I to
        say to them?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        As he passed through the first drawing-room Levin met in the doorway
        Countess Bola, giving some order to a servant with a care-worn and
        severe face. On seeing Levin she smiled, and asked him to come into the
        little drawing-room, where he heard voices. In this room there were
        sitting in armchairs the two daughters of the countess, and a Moscow
        colonel, whom Levin knew. Levin went up, greeted them, and sat down
        beside the sofa with his hat on his knees.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How is your wife? Have you been at the concert? We couldn&rsquo;t
        go. Mamma had to be at the funeral service.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I heard.... What a sudden death!&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        The countess came in, sat down on the sofa, and she too asked after his
        wife and inquired about the concert.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin answered, and repeated an inquiry about Madame Apraksina&rsquo;s
        sudden death.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But she was always in weak health.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Were you at the opera yesterday?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I was.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Lucca was very good.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, very good,&rdquo; he said, and as it was utterly of no
        consequence to him what they thought of him, he began repeating what
        they had heard a hundred times about the characteristics of the
        singer&rsquo;s talent. Countess Bola pretended to be listening. Then,
        when he had said enough and paused, the colonel, who had been silent
        till then, began to talk. The colonel too talked of the opera, and about
        culture. At last, after speaking of the proposed
        <i>folle journée</i> at Turin&rsquo;s, the colonel laughed, got up
        noisily, and went away. Levin too rose, but he saw by the face of the
        countess that it was not yet time for him to go. He must stay two
        minutes longer. He sat down.
      </p>

      <p>
        But as he was thinking all the while how stupid it was, he could not
        find a subject for conversation, and sat silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are not going to the public meeting? They say it will be very
        interesting,&rdquo; began the countess.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I promised my <i>belle-sœur</i> to fetch her from it,&rdquo;
        said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        A silence followed. The mother once more exchanged glances with a
        daughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, now I think the time has come,&rdquo; thought Levin, and he
        got up. The ladies shook hands with him, and begged him to say
        <i>mille choses</i>
        to his wife for them.
      </p>

      <p>
        The porter asked him, as he gave him his coat, &ldquo;Where is your
        honor staying?&rdquo; and immediately wrote down his address in a big
        handsomely bound book.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t care, but still I feel ashamed and
        awfully stupid,&rdquo; thought Levin, consoling himself with the
        reflection that everyone does it. He drove to the public meeting, where
        he was to find his sister-in-law, so as to drive home with her.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the public meeting of the committee there were a great many people,
        and almost all the highest society. Levin was in time for the report
        which, as everyone said, was very interesting. When the reading of the
        report was over, people moved about, and Levin met Sviazhsky, who
        invited him very pressingly to come that evening to a meeting of the
        Society of Agriculture, where a celebrated lecture was to be delivered,
        and Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had only just come from the races, and many
        other acquaintances; and Levin heard and uttered various criticisms on
        the meeting, on the new fantasia, and on a public trial. But, probably
        from the mental fatigue he was beginning to feel, he made a blunder in
        speaking of the trial, and this blunder he recalled several times with
        vexation. Speaking of the sentence upon a foreigner who had been
        condemned in Russia, and of how unfair it would be to punish him by
        exile abroad, Levin repeated what he had heard the day before in
        conversation from an acquaintance.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think sending him abroad is much the same as punishing a carp
        by putting it into the water,&rdquo; said Levin. Then he recollected
        that this idea, which he had heard from an acquaintance and uttered as
        his own, came from a fable of Krilov&rsquo;s, and that the acquaintance
        had picked it up from a newspaper article.
      </p>

      <p>
        After driving home with his sister-in-law, and finding Kitty in good
        spirits and quite well, Levin drove to the club.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 7</h3>

      <p>
        Levin reached the club just at the right time. Members and visitors were
        driving up as he arrived. Levin had not been at the club for a very long
        while&mdash;not since he lived in Moscow, when he was leaving the
        university and going into society. He remembered the club, the external
        details of its arrangement, but he had completely forgotten the
        impression it had made on him in old days. But as soon as, driving into
        the wide semicircular court and getting out of the sledge, he mounted
        the steps, and the hall-porter, adorned with a crossway scarf,
        noiselessly opened the door to him with a bow; as soon as he saw in the
        porter&rsquo;s room the cloaks and galoshes of members who thought it
        less trouble to take them off downstairs; as soon as he heard the
        mysterious ringing bell that preceded him as he ascended the easy,
        carpeted staircase, and saw the statue on the landing, and the third
        porter at the top doors, a familiar figure grown older, in the club
        livery, opening the door without haste or delay, and scanning the
        visitors as they passed in&mdash;Levin felt the old impression of the
        club come back in a rush, an impression of repose, comfort, and
        propriety.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Your hat, please,&rdquo; the porter said to Levin, who forgot the
        club rule to leave his hat in the porter&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;Long time
        since you&rsquo;ve been. The prince put your name down yesterday. Prince
        Stepan Arkadyevitch is not here yet.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The porter did not only know Levin, but also all his ties and
        relationships, and so immediately mentioned his intimate friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        Passing through the outer hall, divided up by screens, and the room
        partitioned on the right, where a man sits at the fruit buffet, Levin
        overtook an old man walking slowly in, and entered the dining-room full
        of noise and people.
      </p>

      <p>
        He walked along the tables, almost all full, and looked at the visitors.
        He saw people of all sorts, old and young; some he knew a little, some
        intimate friends. There was not a single cross or worried-looking face.
        All seemed to have left their cares and anxieties in the porter&rsquo;s
        room with their hats, and were all deliberately getting ready to enjoy
        the material blessings of life. Sviazhsky was here and Shtcherbatsky,
        Nevyedovsky and the old prince, and Vronsky and Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! why are you late?&rdquo; the prince said smiling, and giving
        him his hand over his own shoulder. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Kitty?&rdquo; he
        added, smoothing out the napkin he had tucked in at his waistcoat
        buttons.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;All right; they are dining at home, all the three of them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, &lsquo;Aline-Nadine,&rsquo; to be sure! There&rsquo;s no room
        with us. Go to that table, and make haste and take a seat,&rdquo; said
        the prince, and turning away he carefully took a plate of eel soup.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Levin, this way!&rdquo; a good-natured voice shouted a little
        farther on. It was Turovtsin. He was sitting with a young officer, and
        beside them were two chairs turned upside down. Levin gladly went up to
        them. He had always liked the good-hearted rake, Turovtsin&mdash;he was
        associated in his mind with memories of his courtship&mdash;and at that
        moment, after the strain of intellectual conversation, the sight of
        Turovtsin&rsquo;s good-natured face was particularly welcome.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For you and Oblonsky. He&rsquo;ll be here directly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The young man, holding himself very erect, with eyes forever twinkling
        with enjoyment, was an officer from Petersburg, Gagin. Turovtsin
        introduced them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oblonsky&rsquo;s always late.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, here he is!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you only just come?&rdquo; said Oblonsky, coming quickly
        towards them. &ldquo;Good day. Had some vodka? Well, come along
        then.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin got up and went with him to the big table spread with spirits and
        appetizers of the most various kinds. One would have thought that out of
        two dozen delicacies one might find something to one&rsquo;s taste, but
        Stepan Arkadyevitch asked for something special, and one of the liveried
        waiters standing by immediately brought what was required. They drank a
        wine-glassful and returned to their table.
      </p>

      <p>
        At once, while they were still at the soup, Gagin was served with
        champagne, and told the waiter to fill four glasses. Levin did not
        refuse the wine, and asked for a second bottle. He was very hungry, and
        ate and drank with great enjoyment, and with still greater enjoyment
        took part in the lively and simple conversation of his companions.
        Gagin, dropping his voice, told the last good story from Petersburg, and
        the story, though improper and stupid, was so ludicrous that Levin broke
        into roars of laughter so loud that those near looked round.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s in the same style as, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s a thing I
        can&rsquo;t endure!&rsquo; You know the story?&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s exquisite! Another bottle,&rdquo;
        he said to the waiter, and he began to relate his good story.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Pyotr Illyitch Vinovsky invites you to drink with him,&rdquo; a
        little old waiter interrupted Stepan Arkadyevitch, bringing two delicate
        glasses of sparkling champagne, and addressing Stepan Arkadyevitch and
        Levin. Stepan Arkadyevitch took the glass, and looking towards a bald
        man with red mustaches at the other end of the table, he nodded to him,
        smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You met him once at my place, don&rsquo;t you remember? A
        good-natured fellow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin did the same as Stepan Arkadyevitch and took the glass.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s anecdote too was very amusing. Levin told
        his story, and that too was successful. Then they talked of horses, of
        the races, of what they had been doing that day, and of how smartly
        Vronsky&rsquo;s Atlas had won the first prize. Levin did not notice how
        the time passed at dinner.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! and here they are!&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch said towards
        the end of dinner, leaning over the back of his chair and holding out
        his hand to Vronsky, who came up with a tall officer of the Guards.
        Vronsky&rsquo;s face too beamed with the look of good-humored enjoyment
        that was general in the club. He propped his elbow playfully on Stepan
        Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s shoulder, whispering something to him, and he held
        out his hand to Levin with the same good-humored smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very glad to meet you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I looked out for
        you at the election, but I was told you had gone away.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I left the same day. We&rsquo;ve just been talking of your
        horse. I congratulate you,&rdquo; said Levin. &ldquo;It was very rapidly
        run.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; you&rsquo;ve race horses too, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, my father had; but I remember and know something about
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where have you dined?&rdquo; asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We were at the second table, behind the columns.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been celebrating his success,&rdquo; said the tall
        colonel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his second Imperial prize. I wish I might
        have the luck at cards he has with horses. Well, why waste the precious
        time? I&rsquo;m going to the &lsquo;infernal regions,&rsquo;&rdquo;
        added the colonel, and he walked away.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Yashvin,&rdquo; Vronsky said in answer to Turovtsin,
        and he sat down in the vacated seat beside them. He drank the glass
        offered him, and ordered a bottle of wine. Under the influence of the
        club atmosphere or the wine he had drunk, Levin chatted away to Vronsky
        of the best breeds of cattle, and was very glad not to feel the
        slightest hostility to this man. He even told him, among other things,
        that he had heard from his wife that she had met him at Princess Marya
        Borissovna&rsquo;s.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, Princess Marya Borissovna, she&rsquo;s exquisite!&rdquo; said
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, and he told an anecdote about her which set them
        all laughing. Vronsky particularly laughed with such simplehearted
        amusement that Levin felt quite reconciled to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, have we finished?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting
        up with a smile. &ldquo;Let us go.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 8</h3>

      <p>
        Getting up from the table, Levin walked with Gagin through the lofty
        room to the billiard room, feeling his arms swing as he walked with a
        peculiar lightness and ease. As he crossed the big room, he came upon
        his father-in-law.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, how do you like our Temple of Indolence?&rdquo; said the
        prince, taking his arm. &ldquo;Come along, come along!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I wanted to walk about and look at everything. It&rsquo;s
        interesting.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s interesting for you. But its interest for me is
        quite different. You look at those little old men now,&rdquo; he said,
        pointing to a club member with bent back and projecting lip, shuffling
        towards them in his soft boots, &ldquo;and imagine that they were
        <i>shlupiks</i> like that from their birth up.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;How <i>shlupiks</i>?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I see you don&rsquo;t know that name. That&rsquo;s our club
        designation. You know the game of rolling eggs: when one&rsquo;s rolled
        a long while it becomes a <i>shlupik</i>. So it is with us; one goes on
        coming and coming to the club, and ends by becoming a <i>shlupik</i>.
        Ah, you laugh! but we look out, for fear of dropping into it ourselves.
        You know Prince Tchetchensky?&rdquo; inquired the prince; and Levin saw
        by his face that he was just going to relate something funny.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so! Well, Prince Tchetchensky is a well-known
        figure. No matter, though. He&rsquo;s always playing billiards here.
        Only three years ago he was not a <i>shlupik</i> and kept up his spirits
        and even used to call other people <i>shlupiks</i>. But one day he turns
        up, and our porter ... you know Vassily? Why, that fat one; he&rsquo;s
        famous for his <i>bon mots</i>. And so Prince Tchetchensky asks him,
        &lsquo;Come, Vassily, who&rsquo;s here? Any <i>shlupiks</i> here
        yet?&rsquo; And he says, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re the third.&rsquo; Yes, my
        dear boy, that he did!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Talking and greeting the friends they met, Levin and the prince walked
        through all the rooms: the great room where tables had already been set,
        and the usual partners were playing for small stakes; the divan room,
        where they were playing chess, and Sergey Ivanovitch was sitting talking
        to somebody; the billiard room, where, about a sofa in a recess, there
        was a lively party drinking champagne&mdash;Gagin was one of them. They
        peeped into the &ldquo;infernal regions,&rdquo; where a good many men
        were crowding round one table, at which Yashvin was sitting. Trying not
        to make a noise, they walked into the dark reading room, where under the
        shaded lamps there sat a young man with a wrathful countenance, turning
        over one journal after another, and a bald general buried in a book.
        They went, too, into what the prince called the intellectual room, where
        three gentlemen were engaged in a heated discussion of the latest
        political news.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Prince, please come, we&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; said one of his
        card party, who had come to look for him, and the prince went off. Levin
        sat down and listened, but recalling all the conversation of the morning
        he felt all of a sudden fearfully bored. He got up hurriedly, and went
        to look for Oblonsky and Turovtsin, with whom it had been so pleasant.
      </p>

      <p>
        Turovtsin was one of the circle drinking in the billiard room, and
        Stepan Arkadyevitch was talking with Vronsky near the door at the
        farther corner of the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that she&rsquo;s dull; but this undefined, this
        unsettled position,&rdquo; Levin caught, and he was hurrying away, but
        Stepan Arkadyevitch called to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Levin,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and Levin noticed that
        his eyes were not full of tears exactly, but moist, which always
        happened when he had been drinking, or when he was touched. Just now it
        was due to both causes. &ldquo;Levin, don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; he said,
        and he warmly squeezed his arm above the elbow, obviously not at all
        wishing to let him go.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This is a true friend of mine&mdash;almost my greatest
        friend,&rdquo; he said to Vronsky. &ldquo;You have become even closer
        and dearer to me. And I want you, and I know you ought, to be friends,
        and great friends, because you&rsquo;re both splendid fellows.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing for us now but to kiss and be
        friends,&rdquo; Vronsky said, with good-natured playfulness, holding out
        his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin quickly took the offered hand, and pressed it warmly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very, very glad,&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Waiter, a bottle of champagne,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m very glad,&rdquo; said Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        But in spite of Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s desire, and their own
        desire, they had nothing to talk about, and both felt it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know, he has never met Anna?&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch
        said to Vronsky. &ldquo;And I want above everything to take him to see
        her. Let us go, Levin!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Vronsky. &ldquo;She will be very glad to see
        you. I should be going home at once,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but
        I&rsquo;m worried about Yashvin, and I want to stay on till he
        finishes.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, is he losing?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He keeps losing, and I&rsquo;m the only friend that can restrain
        him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what do you say to pyramids? Levin, will you play?
        Capital!&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;Get the table
        ready,&rdquo; he said to the marker.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It has been ready a long while,&rdquo; answered the marker, who
        had already set the balls in a triangle, and was knocking the red one
        about for his own diversion.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, let us begin.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        After the game Vronsky and Levin sat down at Gagin&rsquo;s table, and at
        Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s suggestion Levin took a hand in the game.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky sat down at the table, surrounded by friends, who were
        incessantly coming up to him. Every now and then he went to the
        &ldquo;infernal&rdquo; to keep an eye on Yashvin. Levin was enjoying a
        delightful sense of repose after the mental fatigue of the morning. He
        was glad that all hostility was at an end with Vronsky, and the sense of
        peace, decorum, and comfort never left him.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the game was over, Stepan Arkadyevitch took Levin&rsquo;s arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, let us go to Anna&rsquo;s, then. At once? Eh? She is at
        home. I promised her long ago to bring you. Where were you meaning to
        spend the evening?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, nowhere specially. I promised Sviazhsky to go to the Society
        of Agriculture. By all means, let us go,&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very good; come along. Find out if my carriage is here,&rdquo;
        Stepan Arkadyevitch said to the waiter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin went up to the table, paid the forty roubles he had lost; paid his
        bill, the amount of which was in some mysterious way ascertained by the
        little old waiter who stood at the counter, and swinging his arms he
        walked through all the rooms to the way out.
      </p>

        &ldquo;Oblonsky&rsquo;s carriage!&rdquo; the porter shouted in an angry
        bass. The carriage drove up and both got in. It was only for the first
        few moments, while the carriage was driving out of the clubhouse gates,
        that Levin was still under the influence of the club atmosphere of
        repose, comfort, and unimpeachable good form. But as soon as the
        carriage drove out into the street, and he felt it jolting over the
        uneven road, heard the angry shout of a sledge driver coming towards
        them, saw in the uncertain light the red blind of a tavern and the
        shops, this impression was dissipated, and he began to think over his
        actions, and to wonder whether he was doing right in going to see Anna.
        What would Kitty say? But Stepan Arkadyevitch gave him no time for
        reflection, and, as though divining his doubts, he scattered them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How glad I am,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you should know her!
        You know Dolly has long wished for it. And Lvov&rsquo;s been to see her,
        and often goes. Though she is my sister,&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch
        pursued, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hesitate to say that she&rsquo;s a
        remarkable woman. But you will see. Her position is very painful,
        especially now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why especially now?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We are carrying on negotiations with her husband about a divorce.
        And he&rsquo;s agreed; but there are difficulties in regard to the son,
        and the business, which ought to have been arranged long ago, has been
        dragging on for three months past. As soon as the divorce is over, she
        will marry Vronsky. How stupid these old ceremonies are, that no one
        believes in, and which only prevent people being comfortable!&rdquo;
        Stepan Arkadyevitch put in. &ldquo;Well, then their position will be as
        regular as mine, as yours.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the difficulty?&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a long and tedious story! The whole business is in
        such an anomalous position with us. But the point is she has been for
        three months in Moscow, where everyone knows her, waiting for the
        divorce; she goes out nowhere, sees no woman except Dolly, because, do
        you understand, she doesn&rsquo;t care to have people come as a favor.
        That fool Princess Varvara, even she has left her, considering this a
        breach of propriety. Well, you see, in such a position any other woman
        would not have found resources in herself. But you&rsquo;ll see how she
        has arranged her life&mdash;how calm, how dignified she is. To the left,
        in the crescent opposite the church!&rdquo; shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        leaning out of the window. &ldquo;Phew! how hot it is!&rdquo; he said,
        in spite of twelve degrees of frost, flinging his open overcoat still
        wider open.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But she has a daughter: no doubt she&rsquo;s busy looking after
        her?&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I believe you picture every woman simply as a female,
        <i>une couveuse,</i>&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;If
        she&rsquo;s occupied, it must be with her children. No, she brings her
        up capitally, I believe, but one doesn&rsquo;t hear about her.
        She&rsquo;s busy, in the first place, with what she writes. I see
        you&rsquo;re smiling ironically, but you&rsquo;re wrong. She&rsquo;s
        writing a children&rsquo;s book, and doesn&rsquo;t talk about it to
        anyone, but she read it to me and I gave the manuscript to Vorkuev ...
        you know the publisher ... and he&rsquo;s an author himself too, I
        fancy. He understands those things, and he says it&rsquo;s a remarkable
        piece of work. But are you fancying she&rsquo;s an authoress?&mdash;not
        a bit of it. She&rsquo;s a woman with a heart, before everything, but
        you&rsquo;ll see. Now she has a little English girl with her, and a
        whole family she&rsquo;s looking after.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, something in a philanthropic way?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, you will look at everything in the worst light. It&rsquo;s
        not from philanthropy, it&rsquo;s from the heart. They&mdash;that is,
        Vronsky&mdash;had a trainer, an Englishman, first-rate in his own line,
        but a drunkard. He&rsquo;s completely given up to drink&mdash;delirium
        tremens&mdash;and the family were cast on the world. She saw them,
        helped them, got more and more interested in them, and now the whole
        family is on her hands. But not by way of patronage, you know, helping
        with money; she&rsquo;s herself preparing the boys in Russian for the
        high school, and she&rsquo;s taken the little girl to live with her. But
        you&rsquo;ll see her for yourself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The carriage drove into the courtyard, and Stepan Arkadyevitch rang
        loudly at the entrance where sledges were standing.
      </p>

      <p>
        And without asking the servant who opened the door whether the lady were
        at home, Stepan Arkadyevitch walked into the hall. Levin followed him,
        more and more doubtful whether he was doing right or wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at himself in the glass, Levin noticed that he was red in the
        face, but he felt certain he was not drunk, and he followed Stepan
        Arkadyevitch up the carpeted stairs. At the top Stepan Arkadyevitch
        inquired of the footman, who bowed to him as to an intimate friend, who
        was with Anna Arkadyevna, and received the answer that it was M.
        Vorkuev.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In the study.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Passing through the dining-room, a room not very large, with dark,
        paneled walls, Stepan Arkadyevitch and Levin walked over the soft carpet
        to the half-dark study, lighted up by a single lamp with a big dark
        shade. Another lamp with a reflector was hanging on the wall, lighting
        up a big full-length portrait of a woman, which Levin could not help
        looking at. It was the portrait of Anna, painted in Italy by Mihailov.
        While Stepan Arkadyevitch went behind the <i>treillage</i>, and the
        man&rsquo;s voice which had been speaking paused, Levin gazed at the
        portrait, which stood out from the frame in the brilliant light thrown
        on it, and he could not tear himself away from it. He positively forgot
        where he was, and not even hearing what was said, he could not take his
        eyes off the marvelous portrait. It was not a picture, but a living,
        charming woman, with black curling hair, with bare arms and shoulders,
        with a pensive smile on the lips, covered with soft down; triumphantly
        and softly she looked at him with eyes that baffled him. She was not
        living only because she was more beautiful than a living woman can be.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am delighted!&rdquo; He heard suddenly near him a voice,
        unmistakably addressing him, the voice of the very woman he had been
        admiring in the portrait. Anna had come from behind the
        <i>treillage</i> to meet him, and Levin saw in the dim light of the
        study the very woman of the portrait, in a dark blue shot gown, not in
        the same position nor with the same expression, but with the same
        perfection of beauty which the artist had caught in the portrait. She
        was less dazzling in reality, but, on the other hand, there was
        something fresh and seductive in the living woman which was not in the
        portrait.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 10</h3>

      <p>
        She had risen to meet him, not concealing her pleasure at seeing him;
        and in the quiet ease with which she held out her little vigorous hand,
        introduced him to Vorkuev and indicated a red-haired, pretty little girl
        who was sitting at work, calling her her pupil, Levin recognized and
        liked the manners of a woman of the great world, always self-possessed
        and natural.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am delighted, delighted,&rdquo; she repeated, and on her lips
        these simple words took for Levin&rsquo;s ears a special significance.
        &ldquo;I have known you and liked you for a long while, both from your
        friendship with Stiva and for your wife&rsquo;s sake.... I knew her for
        a very short time, but she left on me the impression of an exquisite
        flower, simply a flower. And to think she will soon be a mother!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She spoke easily and without haste, looking now and then from Levin to
        her brother, and Levin felt that the impression he was making was good,
        and he felt immediately at home, simple and happy with her, as though he
        had known her from childhood.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ivan Petrovitch and I settled in Alexey&rsquo;s study,&rdquo; she
        said in answer to Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s question whether he might
        smoke, &ldquo;just so as to be able to smoke&rdquo;&mdash;and glancing
        at Levin, instead of asking whether he would smoke, she pulled closer a
        tortoise-shell cigar-case and took a cigarette.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How are you feeling today?&rdquo; her brother asked her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, nothing. Nerves, as usual.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it extraordinarily fine?&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, noticing that Levin was scrutinizing the picture.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have never seen a better portrait.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And extraordinarily like, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Vorkuev.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin looked from the portrait to the original. A peculiar brilliance
        lighted up Anna&rsquo;s face when she felt his eyes on her. Levin
        flushed, and to cover his confusion would have asked whether she had
        seen Darya Alexandrovna lately; but at that moment Anna spoke. &ldquo;We
        were just talking, Ivan Petrovitch and I, of Vashtchenkov&rsquo;s last
        pictures. Have you seen them?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I have seen them,&rdquo; answered Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But, I beg your pardon, I interrupted you ... you were
        saying?...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin asked if she had seen Dolly lately.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She was here yesterday. She was very indignant with the high
        school people on Grisha&rsquo;s account. The Latin teacher, it seems,
        had been unfair to him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I have seen his pictures. I didn&rsquo;t care for them very
        much,&rdquo; Levin went back to the subject she had started.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin talked now not at all with that purely businesslike attitude to
        the subject with which he had been talking all the morning. Every word
        in his conversation with her had a special significance. And talking to
        her was pleasant; still pleasanter it was to listen to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna talked not merely naturally and cleverly, but cleverly and
        carelessly, attaching no value to her own ideas and giving great weight
        to the ideas of the person she was talking to.
      </p>

      <p>
        The conversation turned on the new movement in art, on the new
        illustrations of the Bible by a French artist. Vorkuev attacked the
        artist for a realism carried to the point of coarseness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin said that the French had carried conventionality further than
        anyone, and that consequently they see a great merit in the return to
        realism. In the fact of not lying they see poetry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Never had anything clever said by Levin given him so much pleasure as
        this remark. Anna&rsquo;s face lighted up at once, as at once she
        appreciated the thought. She laughed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I laugh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as one laughs when one sees a
        very true portrait. What you said so perfectly hits off French art now,
        painting and literature too, indeed&mdash;Zola, Daudet. But perhaps it
        is always so, that men form their conceptions from fictitious,
        conventional types, and then&mdash;all the
        <i>combinaisons</i> made&mdash;they are tired of the fictitious figures
        and begin to invent more natural, true figures.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s perfectly true,&rdquo; said Vorknev.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve been at the club?&rdquo; she said to her brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, this is a woman!&rdquo; Levin thought, forgetting
        himself and staring persistently at her lovely, mobile face, which at
        that moment was all at once completely transformed. Levin did not hear
        what she was talking of as she leaned over to her brother, but he was
        struck by the change of her expression. Her face&mdash;so handsome a
        moment before in its repose&mdash;suddenly wore a look of strange
        curiosity, anger, and pride. But this lasted only an instant. She
        dropped her eyelids, as though recollecting something.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, but that&rsquo;s of no interest to anyone,&rdquo; she
        said, and she turned to the English girl.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Please order the tea in the drawing-room,&rdquo; she said in
        English.
      </p>

      <p>
        The girl got up and went out.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, how did she get through her examination?&rdquo; asked
        Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Splendidly! She&rsquo;s a very gifted child and a sweet
        character.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It will end in your loving her more than your own.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There a man speaks. In love there&rsquo;s no more nor less. I
        love my daughter with one love, and her with another.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I was just telling Anna Arkadyevna,&rdquo; said Vorkuev,
        &ldquo;that if she were to put a hundredth part of the energy she
        devotes to this English girl to the public question of the education of
        Russian children, she would be doing a great and useful work.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but I can&rsquo;t help it; I couldn&rsquo;t do it. Count
        Alexey Kirillovitch urged me very much&rdquo; (as she uttered the words
        <i>Count Alexey Kirillovitch</i> she glanced with appealing timidity at
        Levin, and he unconsciously responded with a respectful and reassuring
        look); &ldquo;he urged me to take up the school in the village. I
        visited it several times. The children were very nice, but I could not
        feel drawn to the work. You speak of energy. Energy rests upon love; and
        come as it will, there&rsquo;s no forcing it. I took to this
        child&mdash;I could not myself say why.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And she glanced again at Levin. And her smile and her glance&mdash;all
        told him that it was to him only she was addressing her words, valuing
        his good opinion, and at the same time sure beforehand that they
        understood each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I quite understand that,&rdquo; Levin answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
        impossible to give one&rsquo;s heart to a school or such institutions in
        general, and I believe that&rsquo;s just why philanthropic institutions
        always give such poor results.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She was silent for a while, then she smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she agreed; &ldquo;I never could.
        <i>Je n&rsquo;ai pas le cœur assez</i> large to love a whole asylum of
        horrid little girls. <i>Cela ne m&rsquo;a jamais réussi.</i> There are
        so many women who have made themselves <i>une position sociale</i> in
        that way. And now more than ever,&rdquo; she said with a mournful,
        confiding expression, ostensibly addressing her brother, but
        unmistakably intending her words only for Levin, &ldquo;now when I have
        such need of some occupation, I cannot.&rdquo; And suddenly frowning
        (Levin saw that she was frowning at herself for talking about herself)
        she changed the subject. &ldquo;I know about you,&rdquo; she said to
        Levin; &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re not a public-spirited citizen, and I
        have defended you to the best of my ability.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How have you defended me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, according to the attacks made on you. But won&rsquo;t you
        have some tea?&rdquo; She rose and took up a book bound in morocco.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Give it to me, Anna Arkadyevna,&rdquo; said Vorkuev, indicating
        the book. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well worth taking up.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, it&rsquo;s all so sketchy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I told him about it,&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch said to his
        sister, nodding at Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have. My writing is something after the
        fashion of those little baskets and carving which Liza Mertsalova used
        to sell me from the prisons. She had the direction of the prison
        department in that society,&rdquo; she turned to Levin; &ldquo;and they
        were miracles of patience, the work of those poor wretches.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Levin saw a new trait in this woman, who attracted him so
        extraordinarily. Besides wit, grace, and beauty, she had truth. She had
        no wish to hide from him all the bitterness of her position. As she said
        that she sighed, and her face suddenly taking a hard expression, looked
        as it were turned to stone. With that expression on her face she was
        more beautiful than ever; but the expression was new; it was utterly
        unlike that expression, radiant with happiness and creating happiness,
        which had been caught by the painter in her portrait. Levin looked more
        than once at the portrait and at her figure, as taking her
        brother&rsquo;s arm she walked with him to the high doors and he felt
        for her a tenderness and pity at which he wondered himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        She asked Levin and Vorkuev to go into the drawing-room, while she
        stayed behind to say a few words to her brother. &ldquo;About her
        divorce, about Vronsky, and what he&rsquo;s doing at the club, about
        me?&rdquo; wondered Levin. And he was so keenly interested by the
        question of what she was saying to Stepan Arkadyevitch, that he scarcely
        heard what Vorkuev was telling him of the qualities of the story for
        children Anna Arkadyevna had written.
      </p>

      <p>
        At tea the same pleasant sort of talk, full of interesting matter,
        continued. There was not a single instant when a subject for
        conversation was to seek; on the contrary, it was felt that one had
        hardly time to say what one had to say, and eagerly held back to hear
        what the others were saying. And all that was said, not only by her, but
        by Vorkuev and Stepan Arkadyevitch&mdash;all, so it seemed to Levin,
        gained peculiar significance from her appreciation and her criticism.
        While he followed this interesting conversation, Levin was all the time
        admiring her&mdash;her beauty, her intelligence, her culture, and at the
        same time her directness and genuine depth of feeling. He listened and
        talked, and all the while he was thinking of her inner life, trying to
        divine her feelings. And though he had judged her so severely hitherto,
        now by some strange chain of reasoning he was justifying her and was
        also sorry for her, and afraid that Vronsky did not fully understand
        her. At eleven o&rsquo;clock, when Stepan Arkadyevitch got up to go
        (Vorkuev had left earlier), it seemed to Levin that he had only just
        come. Regretfully Levin too rose.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she said, holding his hand and glancing into his
        face with a winning look. &ldquo;I am very glad
        <i>que la glace est rompue.</i>&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She dropped his hand, and half closed her eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell your wife that I love her as before, and that if she cannot
        pardon me my position, then my wish for her is that she may never pardon
        it. To pardon it, one must go through what I have gone through, and may
        God spare her that.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly, yes, I will tell her....&rdquo; Levin said, blushing.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 11</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a marvelous, sweet and unhappy woman!&rdquo; he was
        thinking, as he stepped out into the frosty air with Stepan
        Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        seeing that Levin had been completely won over.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Levin dreamily, &ldquo;an extraordinary woman!
        It&rsquo;s not her cleverness, but she has such wonderful depth of
        feeling. I&rsquo;m awfully sorry for her!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, please God, everything will soon be settled. Well, well,
        don&rsquo;t be hard on people in future,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, opening the carriage door. &ldquo;Good-bye; we don&rsquo;t
        go the same way.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Still thinking of Anna, of everything, even the simplest phrase in their
        conversation with her, and recalling the minutest changes in her
        expression, entering more and more into her position, and feeling
        sympathy for her, Levin reached home.
      </p>

      <p class="p2">
        At home Kouzma told Levin that Katerina Alexandrovna was quite well, and
        that her sisters had not long been gone, and he handed him two letters.
        Levin read them at once in the hall, that he might not overlook them
        later. One was from Sokolov, his bailiff. Sokolov wrote that the corn
        could not be sold, that it was fetching only five and a half roubles,
        and that more than that could not be got for it. The other letter was
        from his sister. She scolded him for her business being still unsettled.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, we must sell it at five and a half if we can&rsquo;t get
        more,&rdquo; Levin decided the first question, which had always before
        seemed such a weighty one, with extraordinary facility on the spot.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s extraordinary how all one&rsquo;s time is taken up
        here,&rdquo; he thought, considering the second letter. He felt himself
        to blame for not having got done what his sister had asked him to do for
        her. &ldquo;Today, again, I&rsquo;ve not been to the court, but today
        I&rsquo;ve certainly not had time.&rdquo; And resolving that he would
        not fail to do it next day, he went up to his wife. As he went in, Levin
        rapidly ran through mentally the day he had spent. All the events of the
        day were conversations, conversations he had heard and taken part in.
        All the conversations were upon subjects which, if he had been alone at
        home, he would never have taken up, but here they were very interesting.
        And all these conversations were right enough, only in two places there
        was something not quite right. One was what he had said about the carp,
        the other was something not &ldquo;quite the thing&rdquo; in the tender
        sympathy he was feeling for Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin found his wife low-spirited and dull. The dinner of the three
        sisters had gone off very well, but then they had waited and waited for
        him, all of them had felt dull, the sisters had departed, and she had
        been left alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and what have you been doing?&rdquo; she asked him, looking
        straight into his eyes, which shone with rather a suspicious brightness.
        But that she might not prevent his telling her everything, she concealed
        her close scrutiny of him, and with an approving smile listened to his
        account of how he had spent the evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m very glad I met Vronsky. I felt quite at ease and
        natural with him. You understand, I shall try not to see him, but
        I&rsquo;m glad that this awkwardness is all over,&rdquo; he said, and
        remembering that by way of trying not to see him, he had immediately
        gone to call on Anna, he blushed. &ldquo;We talk about the peasants
        drinking; I don&rsquo;t know which drinks most, the peasantry or our own
        class; the peasants do on holidays, but....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But Kitty took not the slightest interest in discussing the drinking
        habits of the peasants. She saw that he blushed, and she wanted to know
        why.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and then where did you go?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Stiva urged me awfully to go and see Anna Arkadyevna.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And as he said this, Levin blushed even more, and his doubts as to
        whether he had done right in going to see Anna were settled once for
        all. He knew now that he ought not to have done so.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty&rsquo;s eyes opened in a curious way and gleamed at Anna&rsquo;s
        name, but controlling herself with an effort, she concealed her emotion
        and deceived him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; was all she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t be angry at my going. Stiva begged
        me to, and Dolly wished it,&rdquo; Levin went on.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she said, but he saw in her eyes a constraint that
        boded him no good.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She is a very sweet, very, very unhappy, good woman,&rdquo; he
        said, telling her about Anna, her occupations, and what she had told him
        to say to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, of course, she is very much to be pitied,&rdquo; said Kitty,
        when he had finished. &ldquo;Whom was your letter from?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He told her, and believing in her calm tone, he went to change his coat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Coming back, he found Kitty in the same easy chair. When he went up to
        her, she glanced at him and broke into sobs.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What? what is it?&rdquo; he asked, knowing beforehand what.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in love with that hateful woman; she has bewitched
        you! I saw it in your eyes. Yes, yes! What can it all lead to? You were
        drinking at the club, drinking and gambling, and then you went ... to
        her of all people! No, we must go away.... I shall go away
        tomorrow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        It was a long while before Levin could soothe his wife. At last he
        succeeded in calming her, only by confessing that a feeling of pity, in
        conjunction with the wine he had drunk, had been too much for him, that
        he had succumbed to Anna&rsquo;s artful influence, and that he would
        avoid her. One thing he did with more sincerity confess to was that
        living so long in Moscow, a life of nothing but conversation, eating and
        drinking, he was degenerating. They talked till three o&rsquo;clock in
        the morning. Only at three o&rsquo;clock were they sufficiently
        reconciled to be able to go to sleep.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 12</h3>

      <p>
        After taking leave of her guests, Anna did not sit down, but began
        walking up and down the room. She had unconsciously the whole evening
        done her utmost to arouse in Levin a feeling of love&mdash;as of late
        she had fallen into doing with all young men&mdash;and she knew she had
        attained her aim, as far as was possible in one evening, with a married
        and conscientious man. She liked him indeed extremely, and, in spite of
        the striking difference, from the masculine point of view, between
        Vronsky and Levin, as a woman she saw something they had in common,
        which had made Kitty able to love both. Yet as soon as he was out of the
        room, she ceased to think of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        One thought, and one only, pursued her in different forms, and refused
        to be shaken off. &ldquo;If I have so much effect on others, on this
        man, who loves his home and his wife, why is it <i>he</i> is so cold to
        me?... not cold exactly, he loves me, I know that! But something new is
        drawing us apart now. Why wasn&rsquo;t he here all the evening? He told
        Stiva to say he could not leave Yashvin, and must watch over his play.
        Is Yashvin a child? But supposing it&rsquo;s true. He never tells a lie.
        But there&rsquo;s something else in it if it&rsquo;s true. He is glad of
        an opportunity of showing me that he has other duties; I know that, I
        submit to that. But why prove that to me? He wants to show me that his
        love for me is not to interfere with his freedom. But I need no proofs,
        I need love. He ought to understand all the bitterness of this life for
        me here in Moscow. Is this life? I am not living, but waiting for an
        event, which is continually put off and put off. No answer again! And
        Stiva says he cannot go to Alexey Alexandrovitch. And I can&rsquo;t
        write again. I can do nothing, can begin nothing, can alter nothing; I
        hold myself in, I wait, inventing amusements for myself&mdash;the
        English family, writing, reading&mdash;but it&rsquo;s all nothing but a
        sham, it&rsquo;s all the same as morphine. He ought to feel for
        me,&rdquo; she said, feeling tears of self-pity coming into her eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        She heard Vronsky&rsquo;s abrupt ring and hurriedly dried her
        tears&mdash;not only dried her tears, but sat down by a lamp and opened
        a book, affecting composure. She wanted to show him that she was
        displeased that he had not come home as he had promised&mdash;displeased
        only, and not on any account to let him see her distress, and least of
        all, her self-pity. She might pity herself, but he must not pity her.
        She did not want strife, she blamed him for wanting to quarrel, but
        unconsciously put herself into an attitude of antagonism.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve not been dull?&rdquo; he said, eagerly and
        good-humoredly, going up to her. &ldquo;What a terrible passion it
        is&mdash;gambling!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve not been dull; I&rsquo;ve learned long ago not to
        be dull. Stiva has been here and Levin.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, they meant to come and see you. Well, how did you like
        Levin?&rdquo; he said, sitting down beside her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very much. They have not long been gone. What was Yashvin
        doing?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He was winning&mdash;seventeen thousand. I got him away. He had
        really started home, but he went back again, and now he&rsquo;s
        losing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then what did you stay for?&rdquo; she asked, suddenly lifting
        her eyes to him. The expression of her face was cold and ungracious.
        &ldquo;You told Stiva you were staying on to get Yashvin away. And you
        have left him there.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The same expression of cold readiness for the conflict appeared on his
        face too.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In the first place, I did not ask him to give you any message;
        and secondly, I never tell lies. But what&rsquo;s the chief point, I
        wanted to stay, and I stayed,&rdquo; he said, frowning. &ldquo;Anna,
        what is it for, why will you?&rdquo; he said after a moment&rsquo;s
        silence, bending over towards her, and he opened his hand, hoping she
        would lay hers in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was glad of this appeal for tenderness. But some strange force of
        evil would not let her give herself up to her feelings, as though the
        rules of warfare would not permit her to surrender.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course you wanted to stay, and you stayed. You do everything
        you want to. But what do you tell me that for? With what object?&rdquo;
        she said, getting more and more excited. &ldquo;Does anyone contest your
        rights? But you want to be right, and you&rsquo;re welcome to be
        right.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        His hand closed, he turned away, and his face wore a still more
        obstinate expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For you it&rsquo;s a matter of obstinacy,&rdquo; she said,
        watching him intently and suddenly finding the right word for that
        expression that irritated her, &ldquo;simply obstinacy. For you
        it&rsquo;s a question of whether you keep the upper hand of me, while
        for me....&rdquo; Again she felt sorry for herself, and she almost burst
        into tears. &ldquo;If you knew what it is for me! When I feel as I do
        now that you are hostile, yes, hostile to me, if you knew what this
        means for me! If you knew how I feel on the brink of calamity at this
        instant, how afraid I am of myself!&rdquo; And she turned away, hiding
        her sobs.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what are you talking about?&rdquo; he said, horrified at her
        expression of despair, and again bending over her, he took her hand and
        kissed it. &ldquo;What is it for? Do I seek amusements outside our home?
        Don&rsquo;t I avoid the society of women?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, yes! If that were all!&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, tell me what I ought to do to give you peace of mind? I am
        ready to do anything to make you happy,&rdquo; he said, touched by her
        expression of despair; &ldquo;what wouldn&rsquo;t I do to save you from
        distress of any sort, as now, Anna!&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, nothing!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
        don&rsquo;t know myself whether it&rsquo;s the solitary life, my
        nerves.... Come, don&rsquo;t let us talk of it. What about the race? You
        haven&rsquo;t told me!&rdquo; she inquired, trying to conceal her
        triumph at the victory, which had anyway been on her side.
      </p>

      <p>
        He asked for supper, and began telling her about the races; but in his
        tone, in his eyes, which became more and more cold, she saw that he did
        not forgive her for her victory, that the feeling of obstinacy with
        which she had been struggling had asserted itself again in him. He was
        colder to her than before, as though he were regretting his surrender.
        And she, remembering the words that had given her the victory,
        &ldquo;how I feel on the brink of calamity, how afraid I am of
        myself,&rdquo; saw that this weapon was a dangerous one, and that it
        could not be used a second time. And she felt that beside the love that
        bound them together there had grown up between them some evil spirit of
        strife, which she could not exorcise from his, and still less from her
        own heart.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 13</h3>

      <p>
        There are no conditions to which a man cannot become used, especially if
        he sees that all around him are living in the same way. Levin could not
        have believed three months before that he could have gone quietly to
        sleep in the condition in which he was that day, that leading an
        aimless, irrational life, living too beyond his means, after drinking to
        excess (he could not call what happened at the club anything else),
        forming inappropriately friendly relations with a man with whom his wife
        had once been in love, and a still more inappropriate call upon a woman
        who could only be called a lost woman, after being fascinated by that
        woman and causing his wife distress&mdash;he could still go quietly to
        sleep. But under the influence of fatigue, a sleepless night, and the
        wine he had drunk, his sleep was sound and untroubled.
      </p>

      <p>
        At five o&rsquo;clock the creak of a door opening waked him. He jumped
        up and looked round. Kitty was not in bed beside him. But there was a
        light moving behind the screen, and he heard her steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it?... what is it?&rdquo; he said, half-asleep.
        &ldquo;Kitty! What is it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she said, coming from behind the screen with a
        candle in her hand. &ldquo;I felt unwell,&rdquo; she said, smiling a
        particularly sweet and meaning smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What? has it begun?&rdquo; he said in terror. &ldquo;We ought to
        send....&rdquo; and hurriedly he reached after his clothes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said, smiling and holding his hand.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure to be nothing. I was rather unwell, only a
        little. It&rsquo;s all over now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And getting into bed, she blew out the candle, lay down and was still.
        Though he thought her stillness suspicious, as though she were holding
        her breath, and still more suspicious the expression of peculiar
        tenderness and excitement with which, as she came from behind the
        screen, she said &ldquo;nothing,&rdquo; he was so sleepy that he fell
        asleep at once. Only later he remembered the stillness of her breathing,
        and understood all that must have been passing in her sweet, precious
        heart while she lay beside him, not stirring, in anticipation of the
        greatest event in a woman&rsquo;s life. At seven o&rsquo;clock he was
        waked by the touch of her hand on his shoulder, and a gentle whisper.
        She seemed struggling between regret at waking him, and the desire to
        talk to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kostya, don&rsquo;t be frightened. It&rsquo;s all right. But I
        fancy.... We ought to send for Lizaveta Petrovna.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The candle was lighted again. She was sitting up in bed, holding some
        knitting, which she had been busy upon during the last few days.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t be frightened, it&rsquo;s all right.
        I&rsquo;m not a bit afraid,&rdquo; she said, seeing his scared face, and
        she pressed his hand to her bosom and then to her lips.
      </p>

      <p>
        He hurriedly jumped up, hardly awake, and kept his eyes fixed on her, as
        he put on his dressing gown; then he stopped, still looking at her. He
        had to go, but he could not tear himself from her eyes. He thought he
        loved her face, knew her expression, her eyes, but never had he seen it
        like this. How hateful and horrible he seemed to himself, thinking of
        the distress he had caused her yesterday. Her flushed face, fringed with
        soft curling hair under her night cap, was radiant with joy and courage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though there was so little that was complex or artificial in
        Kitty&rsquo;s character in general, Levin was struck by what was
        revealed now, when suddenly all disguises were thrown off and the very
        kernel of her soul shone in her eyes. And in this simplicity and
        nakedness of her soul, she, the very woman he loved in her, was more
        manifest than ever. She looked at him, smiling; but all at once her
        brows twitched, she threw up her head, and going quickly up to him,
        clutched his hand and pressed close up to him, breathing her hot breath
        upon him. She was in pain and was, as it were, complaining to him of her
        suffering. And for the first minute, from habit, it seemed to him that
        he was to blame. But in her eyes there was a tenderness that told him
        that she was far from reproaching him, that she loved him for her
        sufferings. &ldquo;If not I, who is to blame for it?&rdquo; he thought
        unconsciously, seeking someone responsible for this suffering for him to
        punish; but there was no one responsible. She was suffering,
        complaining, and triumphing in her sufferings, and rejoicing in them,
        and loving them. He saw that something sublime was being accomplished in
        her soul, but what? He could not make it out. It was beyond his
        understanding.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have sent to mamma. You go quickly to fetch Lizaveta Petrovna
        ... Kostya!... Nothing, it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She moved away from him and rang the bell.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, go now; Pasha&rsquo;s coming. I am all right.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Levin saw with astonishment that she had taken up the knitting she
        had brought in in the night and begun working at it again.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Levin was going out of one door, he heard the maid-servant come in at
        the other. He stood at the door and heard Kitty giving exact directions
        to the maid, and beginning to help her move the bedstead.
      </p>

      <p>
        He dressed, and while they were putting in his horses, as a hired sledge
        was not to be seen yet, he ran again up to the bedroom, not on tiptoe,
        it seemed to him, but on wings. Two maid-servants were carefully moving
        something in the bedroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty was walking about knitting rapidly and giving directions.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going for the doctor. They have sent for Lizaveta
        Petrovna, but I&rsquo;ll go on there too. Isn&rsquo;t there anything
        wanted? Yes, shall I go to Dolly&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She looked at him, obviously not hearing what he was saying.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes. Do go,&rdquo; she said quickly, frowning and waving her
        hand to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had just gone into the drawing-room, when suddenly a plaintive moan
        sounded from the bedroom, smothered instantly. He stood still, and for a
        long while he could not understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that is she,&rdquo; he said to himself, and clutching at his
        head he ran downstairs.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Lord have mercy on us! pardon us! aid us!&rdquo; he repeated the
        words that for some reason came suddenly to his lips. And he, an
        unbeliever, repeated these words not with his lips only. At that instant
        he knew that all his doubts, even the impossibility of believing with
        his reason, of which he was aware in himself, did not in the least
        hinder his turning to God. All of that now floated out of his soul like
        dust. To whom was he to turn if not to Him in whose hands he felt
        himself, his soul, and his love?
      </p>

      <p>
        The horse was not yet ready, but feeling a peculiar concentration of his
        physical forces and his intellect on what he had to do, he started off
        on foot without waiting for the horse, and told Kouzma to overtake him.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the corner he met a night cabman driving hurriedly. In the little
        sledge, wrapped in a velvet cloak, sat Lizaveta Petrovna with a kerchief
        round her head. &ldquo;Thank God! thank God!&rdquo; he said, overjoyed
        to recognize her little fair face which wore a peculiarly serious, even
        stern expression. Telling the driver not to stop, he ran along beside
        her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For two hours, then? Not more?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;You
        should let Pyotr Dmitrievitch know, but don&rsquo;t hurry him. And get
        some opium at the chemist&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you think that it may go on well? Lord have mercy on us and
        help us!&rdquo; Levin said, seeing his own horse driving out of the
        gate. Jumping into the sledge beside Kouzma, he told him to drive to the
        doctor&rsquo;s.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 14</h3>

      <p>
        The doctor was not yet up, and the footman said that &ldquo;he had been
        up late, and had given orders not to be waked, but would get up
        soon.&rdquo; The footman was cleaning the lamp-chimneys, and seemed very
        busy about them. This concentration of the footman upon his lamps, and
        his indifference to what was passing in Levin, at first astounded him,
        but immediately on considering the question he realized that no one knew
        or was bound to know his feelings, and that it was all the more
        necessary to act calmly, sensibly, and resolutely to get through this
        wall of indifference and attain his aim.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry or let anything slip,&rdquo; Levin said
        to himself, feeling a greater and greater flow of physical energy and
        attention to all that lay before him to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having ascertained that the doctor was not getting up, Levin considered
        various plans, and decided on the following one: that Kouzma should go
        for another doctor, while he himself should go to the chemist&rsquo;s
        for opium, and if when he came back the doctor had not yet begun to get
        up, he would either by tipping the footman, or by force, wake the doctor
        at all hazards.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the chemist&rsquo;s the lank shopman sealed up a packet of powders
        for a coachman who stood waiting, and refused him opium with the same
        callousness with which the doctor&rsquo;s footman had cleaned his lamp
        chimneys. Trying not to get flurried or out of temper, Levin mentioned
        the names of the doctor and midwife, and explaining what the opium was
        needed for, tried to persuade him. The assistant inquired in German
        whether he should give it, and receiving an affirmative reply from
        behind the partition, he took out a bottle and a funnel, deliberately
        poured the opium from a bigger bottle into a little one, stuck on a
        label, sealed it up, in spite of Levin&rsquo;s request that he would not
        do so, and was about to wrap it up too. This was more than Levin could
        stand; he took the bottle firmly out of his hands, and ran to the big
        glass doors. The doctor was not even now getting up, and the footman,
        busy now in putting down the rugs, refused to wake him. Levin
        deliberately took out a ten rouble note, and, careful to speak slowly,
        though losing no time over the business, he handed him the note, and
        explained that Pyotr Dmitrievitch (what a great and important personage
        he seemed to Levin now, this Pyotr Dmitrievitch, who had been of so
        little consequence in his eyes before!) had promised to come at any
        time; that he would certainly not be angry! and that he must therefore
        wake him at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        The footman agreed, and went upstairs, taking Levin into the waiting
        room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin could hear through the door the doctor coughing, moving about,
        washing, and saying something. Three minutes passed; it seemed to Levin
        that more than an hour had gone by. He could not wait any longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Pyotr Dmitrievitch, Pyotr Dmitrievitch!&rdquo; he said in an
        imploring voice at the open door. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, forgive
        me! See me as you are. It&rsquo;s been going on more than two hours
        already.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In a minute; in a minute!&rdquo; answered a voice, and to his
        amazement Levin heard that the doctor was smiling as he spoke.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For one instant.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In a minute.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Two minutes more passed while the doctor was putting on his boots, and
        two minutes more while the doctor put on his coat and combed his hair.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Pyotr Dmitrievitch!&rdquo; Levin was beginning again in a
        plaintive voice, just as the doctor came in dressed and ready.
        &ldquo;These people have no conscience,&rdquo; thought Levin.
        &ldquo;Combing his hair, while we&rsquo;re dying!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; the doctor said to him, shaking hands, and,
        as it were, teasing him with his composure. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
        hurry. Well now?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Trying to be as accurate as possible, Levin began to tell him every
        unnecessary detail of his wife&rsquo;s condition, interrupting his
        account repeatedly with entreaties that the doctor would come with him
        at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t be in any hurry. You don&rsquo;t
        understand, you know. I&rsquo;m certain I&rsquo;m not wanted, still
        I&rsquo;ve promised, and if you like, I&rsquo;ll come. But there&rsquo;s
        no hurry. Please sit down; won&rsquo;t you have some coffee?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin stared at him with eyes that asked whether he was laughing at him;
        but the doctor had no notion of making fun of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; the doctor said, smiling; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
        a married man myself; and at these moments we husbands are very much to
        be pitied. I&rsquo;ve a patient whose husband always takes refuge in the
        stables on such occasions.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what do you think, Pyotr Dmitrievitch? Do you suppose it may
        go all right?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Everything points to a favorable issue.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll come immediately?&rdquo; said Levin, looking
        wrathfully at the servant who was bringing in the coffee.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In an hour&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, for mercy&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, let me drink my coffee, anyway.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The doctor started upon his coffee. Both were silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The Turks are really getting beaten, though. Did you read
        yesterday&rsquo;s telegrams?&rdquo; said the doctor, munching some roll.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t stand it!&rdquo; said Levin, jumping up.
        &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll be with us in a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In half an hour.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;On your honor?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        When Levin got home, he drove up at the same time as the princess, and
        they went up to the bedroom door together. The princess had tears in her
        eyes, and her hands were shaking. Seeing Levin, she embraced him, and
        burst into tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, my dear Lizaveta Petrovna?&rdquo; she queried, clasping the
        hand of the midwife, who came out to meet them with a beaming and
        anxious face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going on well,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;persuade her
        to lie down. She will be easier so.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        From the moment when he had waked up and understood what was going on,
        Levin had prepared his mind to bear resolutely what was before him, and
        without considering or anticipating anything, to avoid upsetting his
        wife, and on the contrary to soothe her and keep up her courage. Without
        allowing himself even to think of what was to come, of how it would end,
        judging from his inquiries as to the usual duration of these ordeals,
        Levin had in his imagination braced himself to bear up and to keep a
        tight rein on his feelings for five hours, and it had seemed to him he
        could do this. But when he came back from the doctor&rsquo;s and saw her
        sufferings again, he fell to repeating more and more frequently:
        &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!&rdquo; He sighed, and
        flung his head up, and began to feel afraid he could not bear it, that
        he would burst into tears or run away. Such agony it was to him. And
        only one hour had passed.
      </p>

      <p>
        But after that hour there passed another hour, two hours, three, the
        full five hours he had fixed as the furthest limit of his sufferings,
        and the position was still unchanged; and he was still bearing it
        because there was nothing to be done but bear it; every instant feeling
        that he had reached the utmost limits of his endurance, and that his
        heart would break with sympathy and pain.
      </p>

      <p>
        But still the minutes passed by and the hours, and still hours more, and
        his misery and horror grew and were more and more intense.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the ordinary conditions of life, without which one can form no
        conception of anything, had ceased to exist for Levin. He lost all sense
        of time. Minutes&mdash;those minutes when she sent for him and he held
        her moist hand, that would squeeze his hand with extraordinary violence
        and then push it away&mdash;seemed to him hours, and hours seemed to him
        minutes. He was surprised when Lizaveta Petrovna asked him to light a
        candle behind a screen, and he found that it was five o&rsquo;clock in
        the afternoon. If he had been told it was only ten o&rsquo;clock in the
        morning, he would not have been more surprised. Where he was all this
        time, he knew as little as the time of anything. He saw her swollen
        face, sometimes bewildered and in agony, sometimes smiling and trying to
        reassure him. He saw the old princess too, flushed and overwrought, with
        her gray curls in disorder, forcing herself to gulp down her tears,
        biting her lips; he saw Dolly too and the doctor, smoking fat
        cigarettes, and Lizaveta Petrovna with a firm, resolute, reassuring
        face, and the old prince walking up and down the hall with a frowning
        face. But why they came in and went out, where they were, he did not
        know. The princess was with the doctor in the bedroom, then in the
        study, where a table set for dinner suddenly appeared; then she was not
        there, but Dolly was. Then Levin remembered he had been sent somewhere.
        Once he had been sent to move a table and sofa. He had done this
        eagerly, thinking it had to be done for her sake, and only later on he
        found it was his own bed he had been getting ready. Then he had been
        sent to the study to ask the doctor something. The doctor had answered
        and then had said something about the irregularities in the municipal
        council. Then he had been sent to the bedroom to help the old princess
        to move the holy picture in its silver and gold setting, and with the
        princess&rsquo;s old waiting maid he had clambered on a shelf to reach
        it and had broken the little lamp, and the old servant had tried to
        reassure him about the lamp and about his wife, and he carried the holy
        picture and set it at Kitty&rsquo;s head, carefully tucking it in behind
        the pillow. But where, when, and why all this had happened, he could not
        tell. He did not understand why the old princess took his hand, and
        looking compassionately at him, begged him not to worry himself, and
        Dolly persuaded him to eat something and led him out of the room, and
        even the doctor looked seriously and with commiseration at him and
        offered him a drop of something.
      </p>

      <p>
        All he knew and felt was that what was happening was what had happened
        nearly a year before in the hotel of the country town at the deathbed of
        his brother Nikolay. But that had been grief&mdash;this was joy. Yet
        that grief and this joy were alike outside all the ordinary conditions
        of life; they were loop-holes, as it were, in that ordinary life through
        which there came glimpses of something sublime. And in the contemplation
        of this sublime something the soul was exalted to inconceivable heights
        of which it had before had no conception, while reason lagged behind,
        unable to keep up with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!&rdquo; he repeated to
        himself incessantly, feeling, in spite of his long and, as it seemed,
        complete alienation from religion, that he turned to God just as
        trustfully and simply as he had in his childhood and first youth.
      </p>

      <p>
        All this time he had two distinct spiritual conditions. One was away
        from her, with the doctor, who kept smoking one fat cigarette after
        another and extinguishing them on the edge of a full ashtray, with
        Dolly, and with the old prince, where there was talk about dinner, about
        politics, about Marya Petrovna&rsquo;s illness, and where Levin suddenly
        forgot for a minute what was happening, and felt as though he had waked
        up from sleep; the other was in her presence, at her pillow, where his
        heart seemed breaking and still did not break from sympathetic
        suffering, and he prayed to God without ceasing. And every time he was
        brought back from a moment of oblivion by a scream reaching him from the
        bedroom, he fell into the same strange terror that had come upon him the
        first minute. Every time he heard a shriek, he jumped up, ran to justify
        himself, remembered on the way that he was not to blame, and he longed
        to defend her, to help her. But as he looked at her, he saw again that
        help was impossible, and he was filled with terror and prayed:
        &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on us, and help us!&rdquo; And as time went on,
        both these conditions became more intense; the calmer he became away
        from her, completely forgetting her, the more agonizing became both her
        sufferings and his feeling of helplessness before them. He jumped up,
        would have liked to run away, but ran to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes, when again and again she called upon him, he blamed her; but
        seeing her patient, smiling face, and hearing the words, &ldquo;I am
        worrying you,&rdquo; he threw the blame on God; but thinking of God, at
        once he fell to beseeching God to forgive him and have mercy.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 15</h3>

      <p>
        He did not know whether it was late or early. The candles had all burned
        out. Dolly had just been in the study and had suggested to the doctor
        that he should lie down. Levin sat listening to the doctor&rsquo;s
        stories of a quack mesmerizer and looking at the ashes of his cigarette.
        There had been a period of repose, and he had sunk into oblivion. He had
        completely forgotten what was going on now. He heard the doctor&rsquo;s
        chat and understood it. Suddenly there came an unearthly shriek. The
        shriek was so awful that Levin did not even jump up, but holding his
        breath, gazed in terrified inquiry at the doctor. The doctor put his
        head on one side, listened, and smiled approvingly. Everything was so
        extraordinary that nothing could strike Levin as strange. &ldquo;I
        suppose it must be so,&rdquo; he thought, and still sat where he was.
        Whose scream was this? He jumped up, ran on tiptoe to the bedroom, edged
        round Lizaveta Petrovna and the princess, and took up his position at
        Kitty&rsquo;s pillow. The scream had subsided, but there was some change
        now. What it was he did not see and did not comprehend, and he had no
        wish to see or comprehend. But he saw it by the face of Lizaveta
        Petrovna. Lizaveta Petrovna&rsquo;s face was stern and pale, and still
        as resolute, though her jaws were twitching, and her eyes were fixed
        intently on Kitty. Kitty&rsquo;s swollen and agonized face, a tress of
        hair clinging to her moist brow, was turned to him and sought his eyes.
        Her lifted hands asked for his hands. Clutching his chill hands in her
        moist ones, she began squeezing them to her face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, don&rsquo;t go! I&rsquo;m not afraid, I&rsquo;m
        not afraid!&rdquo; she said rapidly. &ldquo;Mamma, take my earrings.
        They bother me. You&rsquo;re not afraid? Quick, quick, Lizaveta
        Petrovna....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She spoke quickly, very quickly, and tried to smile. But suddenly her
        face was drawn, she pushed him away.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, this is awful! I&rsquo;m dying, I&rsquo;m dying! Go
        away!&rdquo; she shrieked, and again he heard that unearthly scream.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin clutched at his head and ran out of the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, it&rsquo;s nothing, it&rsquo;s all
        right,&rdquo; Dolly called after him.
      </p>

      <p>
        But they might say what they liked, he knew now that all was over. He
        stood in the next room, his head leaning against the door post, and
        heard shrieks, howls such as he had never heard before, and he knew that
        what had been Kitty was uttering these shrieks. He had long ago ceased
        to wish for the child. By now he loathed this child. He did not even
        wish for her life now, all he longed for was the end of this awful
        anguish.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Doctor! What is it? What is it? By God!&rdquo; he said, snatching
        at the doctor&rsquo;s hand as he came up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end,&rdquo; said the doctor. And the
        doctor&rsquo;s face was so grave as he said it that Levin took
        <i>the end</i> as meaning her death.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beside himself, he ran into the bedroom. The first thing he saw was the
        face of Lizaveta Petrovna. It was even more frowning and stern.
        Kitty&rsquo;s face he did not know. In the place where it had been was
        something that was fearful in its strained distortion and in the sounds
        that came from it. He fell down with his head on the wooden framework of
        the bed, feeling that his heart was bursting. The awful scream never
        paused, it became still more awful, and as though it had reached the
        utmost limit of terror, suddenly it ceased. Levin could not believe his
        ears, but there could be no doubt; the scream had ceased and he heard a
        subdued stir and bustle, and hurried breathing, and her voice, gasping,
        alive, tender, and blissful, uttered softly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
        over!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He lifted his head. With her hands hanging exhausted on the quilt,
        looking extraordinarily lovely and serene, she looked at him in silence
        and tried to smile, and could not.
      </p>

      <p>
        And suddenly, from the mysterious and awful far-away world in which he
        had been living for the last twenty-two hours, Levin felt himself all in
        an instant borne back to the old every-day world, glorified though now,
        by such a radiance of happiness that he could not bear it. The strained
        chords snapped, sobs and tears of joy which he had never foreseen rose
        up with such violence that his whole body shook, that for long they
        prevented him from speaking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Falling on his knees before the bed, he held his wife&rsquo;s hand
        before his lips and kissed it, and the hand, with a weak movement of the
        fingers, responded to his kiss. And meanwhile, there at the foot of the
        bed, in the deft hands of Lizaveta Petrovna, like a flickering light in
        a lamp, lay the life of a human creature, which had never existed
        before, and which would now with the same right, with the same
        importance to itself, live and create in its own image.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alive! alive! And a boy too! Set your mind at rest!&rdquo; Levin
        heard Lizaveta Petrovna saying, as she slapped the baby&rsquo;s back
        with a shaking hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mamma, is it true?&rdquo; said Kitty&rsquo;s voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        The princess&rsquo;s sobs were all the answers she could make. And in
        the midst of the silence there came in unmistakable reply to the
        mother&rsquo;s question, a voice quite unlike the subdued voices
        speaking in the room. It was the bold, clamorous, self-assertive squall
        of the new human being, who had so incomprehensibly appeared.
      </p>

      <p>
        If Levin had been told before that Kitty was dead, and that he had died
        with her, and that their children were angels, and that God was standing
        before him, he would have been surprised at nothing. But now, coming
        back to the world of reality, he had to make great mental efforts to
        take in that she was alive and well, and that the creature squalling so
        desperately was his son. Kitty was alive, her agony was over. And he was
        unutterably happy. That he understood; he was completely happy in it.
        But the baby? Whence, why, who was he?... He could not get used to the
        idea. It seemed to him something extraneous, superfluous, to which he
        could not accustom himself.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 16</h3>

      <p>
        At ten o&rsquo;clock the old prince, Sergey Ivanovitch, and Stepan
        Arkadyevitch were sitting at Levin&rsquo;s. Having inquired after Kitty,
        they had dropped into conversation upon other subjects. Levin heard
        them, and unconsciously, as they talked, going over the past, over what
        had been up to that morning, he thought of himself as he had been
        yesterday till that point. It was as though a hundred years had passed
        since then. He felt himself exalted to unattainable heights, from which
        he studiously lowered himself so as not to wound the people he was
        talking to. He talked, and was all the time thinking of his wife, of her
        condition now, of his son, in whose existence he tried to school himself
        into believing. The whole world of woman, which had taken for him since
        his marriage a new value he had never suspected before, was now so
        exalted that he could not take it in in his imagination. He heard them
        talk of yesterday&rsquo;s dinner at the club, and thought: &ldquo;What
        is happening with her now? Is she asleep? How is she? What is she
        thinking of? Is he crying, my son Dmitri?&rdquo; And in the middle of
        the conversation, in the middle of a sentence, he jumped up and went out
        of the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Send me word if I can see her,&rdquo; said the prince.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, in a minute,&rdquo; answered Levin, and without
        stopping, he went to her room.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was not asleep, she was talking gently with her mother, making plans
        about the christening.
      </p>

      <p>
        Carefully set to rights, with hair well-brushed, in a smart little cap
        with some blue in it, her arms out on the quilt, she was lying on her
        back. Meeting his eyes, her eyes drew him to her. Her face, bright
        before, brightened still more as he drew near her. There was the same
        change in it from earthly to unearthly that is seen in the face of the
        dead. But then it means farewell, here it meant welcome. Again a rush of
        emotion, such as he had felt at the moment of the child&rsquo;s birth,
        flooded his heart. She took his hand and asked him if he had slept. He
        could not answer, and turned away, struggling with his weakness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have had a nap, Kostya!&rdquo; she said to him; &ldquo;and I am
        so comfortable now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She looked at him, but suddenly her expression changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Give him to me,&rdquo; she said, hearing the baby&rsquo;s cry.
        &ldquo;Give him to me, Lizaveta Petrovna, and he shall look at
        him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To be sure, his papa shall look at him,&rdquo; said Lizaveta
        Petrovna, getting up and bringing something red, and queer, and
        wriggling. &ldquo;Wait a minute, we&rsquo;ll make him tidy first,&rdquo;
        and Lizaveta Petrovna laid the red wobbling thing on the bed, began
        untrussing and trussing up the baby, lifting it up and turning it over
        with one finger and powdering it with something.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin, looking at the tiny, pitiful creature, made strenuous efforts to
        discover in his heart some traces of fatherly feeling for it. He felt
        nothing towards it but disgust. But when it was undressed and he caught
        a glimpse of wee, wee, little hands, little feet, saffron-colored, with
        little toes, too, and positively with a little big toe different from
        the rest, and when he saw Lizaveta Petrovna closing the wide-open little
        hands, as though they were soft springs, and putting them into linen
        garments, such pity for the little creature came upon him, and such
        terror that she would hurt it, that he held her hand back.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lizaveta Petrovna laughed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, don&rsquo;t be frightened!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        When the baby had been put to rights and transformed into a firm doll,
        Lizaveta Petrovna dandled it as though proud of her handiwork, and stood
        a little away so that Levin might see his son in all his glory.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty looked sideways in the same direction, never taking her eyes off
        the baby. &ldquo;Give him to me! give him to me!&rdquo; she said, and
        even made as though she would sit up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What are you thinking of, Katerina Alexandrovna, you
        mustn&rsquo;t move like that! Wait a minute. I&rsquo;ll give him to you.
        Here we&rsquo;re showing papa what a fine fellow we are!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Lizaveta Petrovna, with one hand supporting the wobbling head,
        lifted up on the other arm the strange, limp, red creature, whose head
        was lost in its swaddling clothes. But it had a nose, too, and slanting
        eyes and smacking lips.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A splendid baby!&rdquo; said Lizaveta Petrovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin sighed with mortification. This splendid baby excited in him no
        feeling but disgust and compassion. It was not at all the feeling he had
        looked forward to.
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned away while Lizaveta Petrovna put the baby to the unaccustomed
        breast.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suddenly laughter made him look round. The baby had taken the breast.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, that&rsquo;s enough, that&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; said
        Lizaveta Petrovna, but Kitty would not let the baby go. He fell asleep
        in her arms.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Look, now,&rdquo; said Kitty, turning the baby so that he could
        see it. The aged-looking little face suddenly puckered up still more and
        the baby sneezed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Smiling, hardly able to restrain his tears, Levin kissed his wife and
        went out of the dark room. What he felt towards this little creature was
        utterly unlike what he had expected. There was nothing cheerful and
        joyous in the feeling; on the contrary, it was a new torture of
        apprehension. It was the consciousness of a new sphere of liability to
        pain. And this sense was so painful at first, the apprehension lest this
        helpless creature should suffer was so intense, that it prevented him
        from noticing the strange thrill of senseless joy and even pride that he
        had felt when the baby sneezed.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 17</h3>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s affairs were in a very bad way.
      </p>

      <p>
        The money for two-thirds of the forest had all been spent already, and
        he had borrowed from the merchant in advance at ten per cent discount,
        almost all the remaining third. The merchant would not give more,
        especially as Darya Alexandrovna, for the first time that winter
        insisting on her right to her own property, had refused to sign the
        receipt for the payment of the last third of the forest. All his salary
        went on household expenses and in payment of petty debts that could not
        be put off. There was positively no money.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was unpleasant and awkward, and in Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s
        opinion things could not go on like this. The explanation of the
        position was, in his view, to be found in the fact that his salary was
        too small. The post he filled had been unmistakably very good five years
        ago, but it was so no longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Petrov, the bank director, had twelve thousand; Sventitsky, a company
        director, had seventeen thousand; Mitin, who had founded a bank,
        received fifty thousand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Clearly I&rsquo;ve been napping, and they&rsquo;ve overlooked
        me,&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch thought about himself. And he began
        keeping his eyes and ears open, and towards the end of the winter he had
        discovered a very good berth and had formed a plan of attack upon it, at
        first from Moscow through aunts, uncles, and friends, and then, when the
        matter was well advanced, in the spring, he went himself to Petersburg.
        It was one of those snug, lucrative berths of which there are so many
        more nowadays than there used to be, with incomes ranging from one
        thousand to fifty thousand roubles. It was the post of secretary of the
        committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways, and of
        certain banking companies. This position, like all such appointments,
        called for such immense energy and such varied qualifications, that it
        was difficult for them to be found united in any one man. And since a
        man combining all the qualifications was not to be found, it was at
        least better that the post be filled by an honest than by a dishonest
        man. And Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely an honest
        man&mdash;unemphatically&mdash;in the common acceptation of the words,
        he was an honest man&mdash;emphatically&mdash;in that special sense
        which the word has in Moscow, when they talk of an &ldquo;honest&rdquo;
        politician, an &ldquo;honest&rdquo; writer, an &ldquo;honest&rdquo;
        newspaper, an &ldquo;honest&rdquo; institution, an &ldquo;honest&rdquo;
        tendency, meaning not simply that the man or the institution is not
        dishonest, but that they are capable on occasion of taking a line of
        their own in opposition to the authorities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch moved in those circles in Moscow in which that
        expression had come into use, was regarded there as an honest man, and
        so had more right to this appointment than others.
      </p>

      <p>
        The appointment yielded an income of from seven to ten thousand a year,
        and Oblonsky could fill it without giving up his government position. It
        was in the hands of two ministers, one lady, and two Jews, and all these
        people, though the way had been paved already with them, Stepan
        Arkadyevitch had to see in Petersburg. Besides this business, Stepan
        Arkadyevitch had promised his sister Anna to obtain from Karenin a
        definite answer on the question of divorce. And begging fifty roubles
        from Dolly, he set off for Petersburg.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch sat in Karenin&rsquo;s study listening to his report
        on the causes of the unsatisfactory position of Russian finance, and
        only waiting for the moment when he would finish to speak about his own
        business or about Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s very true,&rdquo; he said, when Alexey
        Alexandrovitch took off the pince-nez, without which he could not read
        now, and looked inquiringly at his former brother-in-law,
        &ldquo;that&rsquo;s very true in particular cases, but still the
        principle of our day is freedom.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but I lay down another principle, embracing the principle of
        freedom,&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch, with emphasis on the word
        &ldquo;embracing,&rdquo; and he put on his pince-nez again, so as to
        read the passage in which this statement was made. And turning over the
        beautifully written, wide-margined manuscript, Alexey Alexandrovitch
        read aloud over again the conclusive passage.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t advocate protection for the sake of private
        interests, but for the public weal, and for the lower and upper classes
        equally,&rdquo; he said, looking over his pince-nez at Oblonsky.
        &ldquo;But <i>they</i> cannot grasp that, <i>they</i> are taken up now
        with personal interests, and carried away by phrases.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch knew that when Karenin began to talk of what
        <i>they</i>
        were doing and thinking, the persons who would not accept his report and
        were the cause of everything wrong in Russia, that it was coming near
        the end. And so now he eagerly abandoned the principle of free-trade,
        and fully agreed. Alexey Alexandrovitch paused, thoughtfully turning
        over the pages of his manuscript.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, by the way,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, &ldquo;I wanted
        to ask you, some time when you see Pomorsky, to drop him a hint that I
        should be very glad to get that new appointment of secretary of the
        committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways and banking
        companies.&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch was familiar by now with the title
        of the post he coveted, and he brought it out rapidly without mistake.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch questioned him as to the duties of this new
        committee, and pondered. He was considering whether the new committee
        would not be acting in some way contrary to the views he had been
        advocating. But as the influence of the new committee was of a very
        complex nature, and his views were of very wide application, he could
        not decide this straight off, and taking off his pince-nez, he said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course, I can mention it to him; but what is your reason
        precisely for wishing to obtain the appointment?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good salary, rising to nine thousand, and my
        means....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nine thousand!&rdquo; repeated Alexey Alexandrovitch, and he
        frowned. The high figure of the salary made him reflect that on that
        side Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s proposed position ran counter to the
        main tendency of his own projects of reform, which always leaned towards
        economy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I consider, and I have embodied my views in a note on the
        subject, that in our day these immense salaries are evidence of the
        unsound economic
        <i>assiette</i> of our finances.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
        &ldquo;Suppose a bank director gets ten thousand&mdash;well, he&rsquo;s
        worth it; or an engineer gets twenty thousand&mdash;after all,
        it&rsquo;s a growing thing, you know!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I assume that a salary is the price paid for a commodity, and it
        ought to conform with the law of supply and demand. If the salary is
        fixed without any regard for that law, as, for instance, when I see two
        engineers leaving college together, both equally well trained and
        efficient, and one getting forty thousand while the other is satisfied
        with two; or when I see lawyers and hussars, having no special
        qualifications, appointed directors of banking companies with immense
        salaries, I conclude that the salary is not fixed in accordance with the
        law of supply and demand, but simply through personal interest. And this
        is an abuse of great gravity in itself, and one that reacts injuriously
        on the government service. I consider....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch made haste to interrupt his brother-in-law.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but you must agree that it&rsquo;s a new institution of
        undoubted utility that&rsquo;s being started. After all, you know,
        it&rsquo;s a growing thing! What they lay particular stress on is the
        thing being carried on honestly,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch with
        emphasis.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the Moscow significance of the word &ldquo;honest&rdquo; was lost on
        Alexey Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Honesty is only a negative qualification,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll do me a great service, anyway,&rdquo; said
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, &ldquo;by putting in a word to Pomorsky&mdash;just
        in the way of conversation....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I fancy it&rsquo;s more in Volgarinov&rsquo;s hands,&rdquo;
        said Alexey Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Volgarinov has fully assented, as far as he&rsquo;s
        concerned,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, turning red. Stepan
        Arkadyevitch reddened at the mention of that name, because he had been
        that morning at the Jew Volgarinov&rsquo;s, and the visit had left an
        unpleasant recollection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch believed most positively that the committee in which
        he was trying to get an appointment was a new, genuine, and honest
        public body, but that morning when Volgarinov had&mdash;intentionally,
        beyond a doubt&mdash;kept him two hours waiting with other petitioners
        in his waiting room, he had suddenly felt uneasy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether he was uncomfortable that he, a descendant of Rurik, Prince
        Oblonsky, had been kept for two hours waiting to see a Jew, or that for
        the first time in his life he was not following the example of his
        ancestors in serving the government, but was turning off into a new
        career, anyway he was very uncomfortable. During those two hours in
        Volgarinov&rsquo;s waiting room Stepan Arkadyevitch, stepping jauntily
        about the room, pulling his whiskers, entering into conversation with
        the other petitioners, and inventing an epigram on his position,
        assiduously concealed from others, and even from himself, the feeling he
        was experiencing.
      </p>

      <p>
        But all the time he was uncomfortable and angry, he could not have said
        why&mdash;whether because he could not get his epigram just right, or
        from some other reason. When at last Volgarinov had received him with
        exaggerated politeness and unmistakable triumph at his humiliation, and
        had all but refused the favor asked of him, Stepan Arkadyevitch had made
        haste to forget it all as soon as possible. And now, at the mere
        recollection, he blushed.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 18</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Now there is something I want to talk about, and you know what it
        is. About Anna,&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch said, pausing for a brief
        space, and shaking off the unpleasant impression.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as Oblonsky uttered Anna&rsquo;s name, the face of Alexey
        Alexandrovitch was completely transformed; all the life was gone out of
        it, and it looked weary and dead.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it exactly that you want from me?&rdquo; he said, moving
        in his chair and snapping his pince-nez.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A definite settlement, Alexey Alexandrovitch, some settlement of
        the position. I&rsquo;m appealing to you&rdquo; (&ldquo;not as an
        injured husband,&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch was going to say, but afraid
        of wrecking his negotiation by this, he changed the words) &ldquo;not as
        a statesman&rdquo; (which did not sound <i>à propos</i>), &ldquo;but
        simply as a man, and a good-hearted man and a Christian. You must have
        pity on her,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That is, in what way precisely?&rdquo; Karenin said softly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, pity on her. If you had seen her as I have!&mdash;I have
        been spending all the winter with her&mdash;you would have pity on her.
        Her position is awful, simply awful!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I had imagined,&rdquo; answered Alexey Alexandrovitch in a
        higher, almost shrill voice, &ldquo;that Anna Arkadyevna had everything
        she had desired for herself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, Alexey Alexandrovitch, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t
        let us indulge in recriminations! What is past is past, and you know
        what she wants and is waiting for&mdash;divorce.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I believe Anna Arkadyevna refuses a divorce, if I make it a
        condition to leave me my son. I replied in that sense, and supposed that
        the matter was ended. I consider it at an end,&rdquo; shrieked Alexey
        Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t get hot!&rdquo; said
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, touching his brother-in-law&rsquo;s knee.
        &ldquo;The matter is not ended. If you will allow me to recapitulate, it
        was like this: when you parted, you were as magnanimous as could
        possibly be; you were ready to give her everything&mdash;freedom,
        divorce even. She appreciated that. No, don&rsquo;t think that. She did
        appreciate it&mdash;to such a degree that at the first moment, feeling
        how she had wronged you, she did not consider and could not consider
        everything. She gave up everything. But experience, time, have shown
        that her position is unbearable, impossible.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The life of Anna Arkadyevna can have no interest for me,&rdquo;
        Alexey Alexandrovitch put in, lifting his eyebrows.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Allow me to disbelieve that,&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch replied
        gently. &ldquo;Her position is intolerable for her, and of no benefit to
        anyone whatever. She has deserved it, you will say. She knows that and
        asks you for nothing; she says plainly that she dare not ask you. But I,
        all of us, her relatives, all who love her, beg you, entreat you. Why
        should she suffer? Who is any the better for it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, you seem to put me in the position of the guilty
        party,&rdquo; observed Alexey Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, oh, no, not at all! please understand me,&rdquo; said
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, touching his hand again, as though feeling sure
        this physical contact would soften his brother-in-law. &ldquo;All I say
        is this: her position is intolerable, and it might be alleviated by you,
        and you will lose nothing by it. I will arrange it all for you, so that
        you&rsquo;ll not notice it. You did promise it, you know.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The promise was given before. And I had supposed that the
        question of my son had settled the matter. Besides, I had hoped that
        Anna Arkadyevna had enough generosity....&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch
        articulated with difficulty, his lips twitching and his face white.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She leaves it all to your generosity. She begs, she implores one
        thing of you&mdash;to extricate her from the impossible position in
        which she is placed. She does not ask for her son now. Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, you are a good man. Put yourself in her position for a
        minute. The question of divorce for her in her position is a question of
        life and death. If you had not promised it once, she would have
        reconciled herself to her position, she would have gone on living in the
        country. But you promised it, and she wrote to you, and moved to Moscow.
        And here she&rsquo;s been for six months in Moscow, where every chance
        meeting cuts her to the heart, every day expecting an answer. Why,
        it&rsquo;s like keeping a condemned criminal for six months with the
        rope round his neck, promising him perhaps death, perhaps mercy. Have
        pity on her, and I will undertake to arrange everything.
        <i>Vos scrupules</i>....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am not talking about that, about that....&rdquo; Alexey
        Alexandrovitch interrupted with disgust. &ldquo;But, perhaps, I promised
        what I had no right to promise.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you go back from your promise?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have never refused to do all that is possible, but I want time
        to consider how much of what I promised is possible.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, Alexey Alexandrovitch!&rdquo; cried Oblonsky, jumping up,
        &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe that! She&rsquo;s unhappy as only an
        unhappy woman can be, and you cannot refuse in such....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;As much of what I promised as is possible.
        <i>Vous professez d&rsquo;être libre penseur.</i> But I as a believer
        cannot, in a matter of such gravity, act in opposition to the Christian
        law.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But in Christian societies and among us, as far as I&rsquo;m
        aware, divorce is allowed,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
        &ldquo;Divorce is sanctioned even by our church. And we see....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It is allowed, but not in the sense....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey Alexandrovitch, you are not like yourself,&rdquo; said
        Oblonsky, after a brief pause. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it you (and
        didn&rsquo;t we all appreciate it in you?) who forgave everything, and
        moved simply by Christian feeling was ready to make any sacrifice? You
        said yourself: if a man take thy coat, give him thy cloak also, and
        now....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I beg,&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch shrilly, getting
        suddenly onto his feet, his face white and his jaws twitching, &ldquo;I
        beg you to drop this ... to drop ... this subject!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no! Oh, forgive me, forgive me if I have wounded you,&rdquo;
        said Stepan Arkadyevitch, holding out his hand with a smile of
        embarrassment; &ldquo;but like a messenger I have simply performed the
        commission given me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch gave him his hand, pondered a little, and said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I must think it over and seek for guidance. The day after
        tomorrow I will give you a final answer,&rdquo; he said, after
        considering a moment.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 19</h3>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch was about to go away when Korney came in to
        announce:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Sergey Alexyevitch!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Sergey Alexyevitch?&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch was
        beginning, but he remembered immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, Seryozha!&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;Sergey Alexyevitch! I
        thought it was the director of a department. Anna asked me to see him
        too,&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        And he recalled the timid, piteous expression with which Anna had said
        to him at parting: &ldquo;Anyway, you will see him. Find out exactly
        where he is, who is looking after him. And Stiva ... if it were
        possible! Could it be possible?&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch knew what was
        meant by that &ldquo;if it were possible,&rdquo;&mdash;if it were
        possible to arrange the divorce so as to let her have her son.... Stepan
        Arkadyevitch saw now that it was no good to dream of that, but still he
        was glad to see his nephew.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch reminded his brother-in-law that they never spoke
        to the boy of his mother, and he begged him not to mention a single word
        about her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He was very ill after that interview with his mother, which we
        had not foreseen,&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch. &ldquo;Indeed, we
        feared for his life. But with rational treatment, and sea-bathing in the
        summer, he regained his strength, and now, by the doctor&rsquo;s advice,
        I have let him go to school. And certainly the companionship of school
        has had a good effect on him, and he is perfectly well, and making good
        progress.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a fine fellow he&rsquo;s grown! He&rsquo;s not Seryozha now,
        but quite full-fledged Sergey Alexyevitch!&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, smiling, as he looked at the handsome, broad-shouldered
        lad in blue coat and long trousers, who walked in alertly and
        confidently. The boy looked healthy and good-humored. He bowed to his
        uncle as to a stranger, but recognizing him, he blushed and turned
        hurriedly away from him, as though offended and irritated at something.
        The boy went up to his father and handed him a note of the marks he had
        gained in school.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s very fair,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;you
        can go.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s thinner and taller, and has grown out of being a child
        into a boy; I like that,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;Do you
        remember me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The boy looked back quickly at his uncle.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, <i>mon oncle</i>,&rdquo; he answered, glancing at his
        father, and again he looked downcast.
      </p>

      <p>
        His uncle called him to him, and took his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and how are you getting on?&rdquo; he said, wanting to talk
        to him, and not knowing what to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        The boy, blushing and making no answer, cautiously drew his hand away.
        As soon as Stepan Arkadyevitch let go his hand, he glanced doubtfully at
        his father, and like a bird set free, he darted out of the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        A year had passed since the last time Seryozha had seen his mother.
        Since then he had heard nothing more of her. And in the course of that
        year he had gone to school, and made friends among his schoolfellows.
        The dreams and memories of his mother, which had made him ill after
        seeing her, did not occupy his thoughts now. When they came back to him,
        he studiously drove them away, regarding them as shameful and girlish,
        below the dignity of a boy and a schoolboy. He knew that his father and
        mother were separated by some quarrel, he knew that he had to remain
        with his father, and he tried to get used to that idea.
      </p>

      <p>
        He disliked seeing his uncle, so like his mother, for it called up those
        memories of which he was ashamed. He disliked it all the more as from
        some words he had caught as he waited at the study door, and still more
        from the faces of his father and uncle, he guessed that they must have
        been talking of his mother. And to avoid condemning the father with whom
        he lived and on whom he was dependent, and, above all, to avoid giving
        way to sentimentality, which he considered so degrading, Seryozha tried
        not to look at his uncle who had come to disturb his peace of mind, and
        not to think of what he recalled to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        But when Stepan Arkadyevitch, going out after him, saw him on the
        stairs, and calling to him, asked him how he spent his playtime at
        school, Seryozha talked more freely to him away from his father&rsquo;s
        presence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We have a railway now,&rdquo; he said in answer to his
        uncle&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this, do you see: two sit
        on a bench&mdash;they&rsquo;re the passengers; and one stands up
        straight on the bench. And all are harnessed to it by their arms or by
        their belts, and they run through all the rooms&mdash;the doors are left
        open beforehand. Well, and it&rsquo;s pretty hard work being the
        conductor!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one that stands?&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch
        inquired, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you want pluck for it, and cleverness too, especially when
        they stop all of a sudden, or someone falls down.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that must be a serious matter,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, watching with mournful interest the eager eyes, like his
        mother&rsquo;s; not childish now&mdash;no longer fully innocent. And
        though he had promised Alexey Alexandrovitch not to speak of Anna, he
        could not restrain himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you remember your mother?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Seryozha said quickly. He blushed
        crimson, and his face clouded over. And his uncle could get nothing more
        out of him. His tutor found his pupil on the staircase half an hour
        later, and for a long while he could not make out whether he was
        ill-tempered or crying.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it? I expect you hurt yourself when you fell down?&rdquo;
        said the tutor. &ldquo;I told you it was a dangerous game. And we shall
        have to speak to the director.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If I had hurt myself, nobody should have found it out,
        that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what is it, then?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Leave me alone! If I remember, or if I don&rsquo;t remember?...
        what business is it of his? Why should I remember? Leave me in
        peace!&rdquo; he said, addressing not his tutor, but the whole world.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 20</h3>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch, as usual, did not waste his time in Petersburg. In
        Petersburg, besides business, his sister&rsquo;s divorce, and his
        coveted appointment, he wanted, as he always did, to freshen himself up,
        as he said, after the mustiness of Moscow.
      </p>

      <p>
        In spite of its <i>cafés chantants</i> and its omnibuses, Moscow was yet
        a stagnant bog. Stepan Arkadyevitch always felt it. After living for
        some time in Moscow, especially in close relations with his family, he
        was conscious of a depression of spirits. After being a long time in
        Moscow without a change, he reached a point when he positively began to
        be worrying himself over his wife&rsquo;s ill-humor and reproaches, over
        his children&rsquo;s health and education, and the petty details of his
        official work; even the fact of being in debt worried him. But he had
        only to go and stay a little while in Petersburg, in the circle there in
        which he moved, where people lived&mdash;really lived&mdash;instead of
        vegetating as in Moscow, and all such ideas vanished and melted away at
        once, like wax before the fire. His wife?... Only that day he had been
        talking to Prince Tchetchensky. Prince Tchetchensky had a wife and
        family, grown-up pages in the corps, ... and he had another illegitimate
        family of children also. Though the first family was very nice too,
        Prince Tchetchensky felt happier in his second family; and he used to
        take his eldest son with him to his second family, and told Stepan
        Arkadyevitch that he thought it good for his son, enlarging his ideas.
        What would have been said to that in Moscow?
      </p>

      <p>
        His children? In Petersburg children did not prevent their parents from
        enjoying life. The children were brought up in schools, and there was no
        trace of the wild idea that prevailed in Moscow, in Lvov&rsquo;s
        household, for instance, that all the luxuries of life were for the
        children, while the parents have nothing but work and anxiety. Here
        people understood that a man is in duty bound to live for himself, as
        every man of culture should live.
      </p>

      <p>
        His official duties? Official work here was not the stiff, hopeless
        drudgery that it was in Moscow. Here there was some interest in official
        life. A chance meeting, a service rendered, a happy phrase, a knack of
        facetious mimicry, and a man&rsquo;s career might be made in a trice. So
        it had been with Bryantsev, whom Stepan Arkadyevitch had met the
        previous day, and who was one of the highest functionaries in government
        now. There was some interest in official work like that.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Petersburg attitude on pecuniary matters had an especially soothing
        effect on Stepan Arkadyevitch. Bartnyansky, who must spend at least
        fifty thousand to judge by the style he lived in, had made an
        interesting comment the day before on that subject.
      </p>

      <p>
        As they were talking before dinner, Stepan Arkadyevitch said to
        Bartnyansky:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re friendly, I fancy, with Mordvinsky; you might do me
        a favor: say a word to him, please, for me. There&rsquo;s an appointment
        I should like to get&mdash;secretary of the agency....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I shan&rsquo;t remember all that, if you tell it to me....
        But what possesses you to have to do with railways and Jews?... Take it
        as you will, it&rsquo;s a low business.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch did not say to Bartnyansky that it was a
        &ldquo;growing thing&rdquo;&mdash;Bartnyansky would not have understood
        that.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I want the money, I&rsquo;ve nothing to live on.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re living, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but in debt.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you, though? Heavily?&rdquo; said Bartnyansky
        sympathetically.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very heavily: twenty thousand.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Bartnyansky broke into good-humored laughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, lucky fellow!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My debts mount up to a
        million and a half, and I&rsquo;ve nothing, and still I can live, as you
        see!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Stepan Arkadyevitch saw the correctness of this view not in words
        only but in actual fact. Zhivahov owed three hundred thousand, and
        hadn&rsquo;t a farthing to bless himself with, and he lived, and in
        style too! Count Krivtsov was considered a hopeless case by everyone,
        and yet he kept two mistresses. Petrovsky had run through five millions,
        and still lived in just the same style, and was even a manager in the
        financial department with a salary of twenty thousand. But besides this,
        Petersburg had physically an agreeable effect on Stepan Arkadyevitch. It
        made him younger. In Moscow he sometimes found a gray hair in his head,
        dropped asleep after dinner, stretched, walked slowly upstairs,
        breathing heavily, was bored by the society of young women, and did not
        dance at balls. In Petersburg he always felt ten years younger.
      </p>

      <p>
        His experience in Petersburg was exactly what had been described to him
        on the previous day by Prince Pyotr Oblonsky, a man of sixty, who had
        just come back from abroad:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know the way to live here,&rdquo; said Pyotr
        Oblonsky. &ldquo;I spent the summer in Baden, and you wouldn&rsquo;t
        believe it, I felt quite a young man. At a glimpse of a pretty woman, my
        thoughts.... One dines and drinks a glass of wine, and feels strong and
        ready for anything. I came home to Russia&mdash;had to see my wife, and,
        what&rsquo;s more, go to my country place; and there, you&rsquo;d hardly
        believe it, in a fortnight I&rsquo;d got into a dressing gown and given
        up dressing for dinner. Needn&rsquo;t say I had no thoughts left for
        pretty women. I became quite an old gentleman. There was nothing left
        for me but to think of my eternal salvation. I went off to Paris&mdash;I
        was as right as could be at once.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch felt exactly the difference that Pyotr Oblonsky
        described. In Moscow he degenerated so much that if he had had to be
        there for long together, he might in good earnest have come to
        considering his salvation; in Petersburg he felt himself a man of the
        world again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Between Princess Betsy Tverskaya and Stepan Arkadyevitch there had long
        existed rather curious relations. Stepan Arkadyevitch always flirted
        with her in jest, and used to say to her, also in jest, the most
        unseemly things, knowing that nothing delighted her so much. The day
        after his conversation with Karenin, Stepan Arkadyevitch went to see
        her, and felt so youthful that in this jesting flirtation and nonsense
        he recklessly went so far that he did not know how to extricate himself,
        as unluckily he was so far from being attracted by her that he thought
        her positively disagreeable. What made it hard to change the
        conversation was the fact that he was very attractive to her. So that he
        was considerably relieved at the arrival of Princess Myakaya, which cut
        short their
        <i>tête-à-tête</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, so you&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; said she when she saw him.
        &ldquo;Well, and what news of your poor sister? You needn&rsquo;t look
        at me like that,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Ever since they&rsquo;ve all
        turned against her, all those who&rsquo;re a thousand times worse than
        she, I&rsquo;ve thought she did a very fine thing. I can&rsquo;t forgive
        Vronsky for not letting me know when she was in Petersburg. I&rsquo;d
        have gone to see her and gone about with her everywhere. Please give her
        my love. Come, tell me about her.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, her position is very difficult; she....&rdquo; began Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, in the simplicity of his heart accepting as sterling coin
        Princess Myakaya&rsquo;s words &ldquo;tell me about her.&rdquo; Princess
        Myakaya interrupted him immediately, as she always did, and began
        talking herself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s done what they all do, except me&mdash;only they hide
        it. But she wouldn&rsquo;t be deceitful, and she did a fine thing. And
        she did better still in throwing up that crazy brother-in-law of yours.
        You must excuse me. Everybody used to say he was so clever, so very
        clever; I was the only one that said he was a fool. Now that he&rsquo;s
        so thick with Lidia Ivanovna and Landau, they all say he&rsquo;s crazy,
        and I should prefer not to agree with everybody, but this time I
        can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, do please explain,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch;
        &ldquo;what does it mean? Yesterday I was seeing him on my
        sister&rsquo;s behalf, and I asked him to give me a final answer. He
        gave me no answer, and said he would think it over. But this morning,
        instead of an answer, I received an invitation from Countess Lidia
        Ivanovna for this evening.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, so that&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; said Princess
        Myakaya gleefully, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re going to ask Landau what
        he&rsquo;s to say.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ask Landau? What for? Who or what&rsquo;s Landau?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What! you don&rsquo;t know Jules Landau,
        <i>le fameux Jules Landau, le clairvoyant</i>? He&rsquo;s crazy too, but
        on him your sister&rsquo;s fate depends. See what comes of living in the
        provinces&mdash;you know nothing about anything. Landau, do you see, was
        a <i>commis</i> in a shop in Paris, and he went to a doctor&rsquo;s; and
        in the doctor&rsquo;s waiting room he fell asleep, and in his sleep he
        began giving advice to all the patients. And wonderful advice it was!
        Then the wife of Yury Meledinsky&mdash;you know, the
        invalid?&mdash;heard of this Landau, and had him to see her husband. And
        he cured her husband, though I can&rsquo;t say that I see he did him
        much good, for he&rsquo;s just as feeble a creature as ever he was, but
        they believed in him, and took him along with them and brought him to
        Russia. Here there&rsquo;s been a general rush to him, and he&rsquo;s
        begun doctoring everyone. He cured Countess Bezzubova, and she took such
        a fancy to him that she adopted him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Adopted him?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, as her son. He&rsquo;s not Landau any more now, but Count
        Bezzubov. That&rsquo;s neither here nor there, though; but
        Lidia&mdash;I&rsquo;m very fond of her, but she has a screw loose
        somewhere&mdash;has lost her heart to this Landau now, and nothing is
        settled now in her house or Alexey Alexandrovitch&rsquo;s without him,
        and so your sister&rsquo;s fate is now in the hands of Landau,
        <i>alias</i> Count Bezzubov.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 21</h3>

      <p>
        After a capital dinner and a great deal of cognac drunk at
        Bartnyansky&rsquo;s, Stepan Arkadyevitch, only a little later than the
        appointed time, went in to Countess Lidia Ivanovna&rsquo;s.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who else is with the countess?&mdash;a Frenchman?&rdquo; Stepan
        Arkadyevitch asked the hall-porter, as he glanced at the familiar
        overcoat of Alexey Alexandrovitch and a queer, rather artless-looking
        overcoat with clasps.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin and Count Bezzubov,&rdquo; the
        porter answered severely.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Princess Myakaya guessed right,&rdquo; thought Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, as he went upstairs. &ldquo;Curious! It would be quite as
        well, though, to get on friendly terms with her. She has immense
        influence. If she would say a word to Pomorsky, the thing would be a
        certainty.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        It was still quite light out-of-doors, but in Countess Lidia
        Ivanovna&rsquo;s little drawing-room the blinds were drawn and the lamps
        lighted. At a round table under a lamp sat the countess and Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, talking softly. A short, thinnish man, very pale and
        handsome, with feminine hips and knock-kneed legs, with fine brilliant
        eyes and long hair lying on the collar of his coat, was standing at the
        end of the room gazing at the portraits on the wall. After greeting the
        lady of the house and Alexey Alexandrovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch could
        not resist glancing once more at the unknown man.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur Landau!&rdquo; the countess addressed him with a
        softness and caution that impressed Oblonsky. And she introduced them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Landau looked round hurriedly, came up, and smiling, laid his moist,
        lifeless hand in Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s outstretched hand and
        immediately walked away and fell to gazing at the portraits again. The
        countess and Alexey Alexandrovitch looked at each other significantly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very glad to see you, particularly today,&rdquo; said
        Countess Lidia Ivanovna, pointing Stepan Arkadyevitch to a seat beside
        Karenin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I introduced you to him as Landau,&rdquo; she said in a soft
        voice, glancing at the Frenchman and again immediately after at Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, &ldquo;but he is really Count Bezzubov, as you&rsquo;re
        probably aware. Only he does not like the title.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I heard so,&rdquo; answered Stepan Arkadyevitch; &ldquo;they
        say he completely cured Countess Bezzubova.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She was here today, poor thing!&rdquo; the countess said, turning
        to Alexey Alexandrovitch. &ldquo;This separation is awful for her.
        It&rsquo;s such a blow to her!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And he positively is going?&rdquo; queried Alexey Alexandrovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s going to Paris. He heard a voice
        yesterday,&rdquo; said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, looking at Stepan
        Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, a voice!&rdquo; repeated Oblonsky, feeling that he must be as
        circumspect as he possibly could in this society, where something
        peculiar was going on, or was to go on, to which he had not the key.
      </p>

      <p>
        A moment&rsquo;s silence followed, after which Countess Lidia Ivanovna,
        as though approaching the main topic of conversation, said with a fine
        smile to Oblonsky:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known you for a long while, and am very glad to make a
        closer acquaintance with you.
        <i>Les amis de nos amis sont nos amis.</i> But to be a true friend, one
        must enter into the spiritual state of one&rsquo;s friend, and I fear
        that you are not doing so in the case of Alexey Alexandrovitch. You
        understand what I mean?&rdquo; she said, lifting her fine pensive eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In part, countess, I understand the position of Alexey
        Alexandrovitch....&rdquo; said Oblonsky. Having no clear idea what they
        were talking about, he wanted to confine himself to generalities.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The change is not in his external position,&rdquo; Countess Lidia
        Ivanovna said sternly, following with eyes of love the figure of Alexey
        Alexandrovitch as he got up and crossed over to Landau; &ldquo;his heart
        is changed, a new heart has been vouchsafed him, and I fear you
        don&rsquo;t fully apprehend the change that has taken place in
        him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, in general outlines I can conceive the change. We have
        always been friendly, and now....&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
        responding with a sympathetic glance to the expression of the countess,
        and mentally balancing the question with which of the two ministers she
        was most intimate, so as to know about which to ask her to speak for
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The change that has taken place in him cannot lessen his love for
        his neighbors; on the contrary, that change can only intensify love in
        his heart. But I am afraid you do not understand me. Won&rsquo;t you
        have some tea?&rdquo; she said, with her eyes indicating the footman,
        who was handing round tea on a tray.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not quite, countess. Of course, his misfortune....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, a misfortune which has proved the highest happiness, when
        his heart was made new, was filled full of it,&rdquo; she said, gazing
        with eyes full of love at Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I do believe I might ask her to speak to both of them,&rdquo;
        thought Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, of course, countess,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I imagine
        such changes are a matter so private that no one, even the most intimate
        friend, would care to speak of them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;On the contrary! We ought to speak freely and help one
        another.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, undoubtedly so, but there is such a difference of
        convictions, and besides....&rdquo; said Oblonsky with a soft smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There can be no difference where it is a question of holy
        truth.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, of course; but....&rdquo; and Stepan Arkadyevitch paused
        in confusion. He understood at last that they were talking of religion.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I fancy he will fall asleep immediately,&rdquo; said Alexey
        Alexandrovitch in a whisper full of meaning, going up to Lidia Ivanovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch looked round. Landau was sitting at the window,
        leaning on his elbow and the back of his chair, his head drooping.
        Noticing that all eyes were turned on him he raised his head and smiled
        a smile of childlike artlessness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take any notice,&rdquo; said Lidia Ivanovna, and she
        lightly moved a chair up for Alexey Alexandrovitch. &ldquo;I have
        observed....&rdquo; she was beginning, when a footman came into the room
        with a letter. Lidia Ivanovna rapidly ran her eyes over the note, and
        excusing herself, wrote an answer with extraordinary rapidity, handed it
        to the man, and came back to the table. &ldquo;I have observed,&rdquo;
        she went on, &ldquo;that Moscow people, especially the men, are more
        indifferent to religion than anyone.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, countess, I thought Moscow people had the reputation of
        being the firmest in the faith,&rdquo; answered Stepan Arkadyevitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But as far as I can make out, you are unfortunately one of the
        indifferent ones,&rdquo; said Alexey Alexandrovitch, turning to him with
        a weary smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How anyone can be indifferent!&rdquo; said Lidia Ivanovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am not so much indifferent on that subject as I am waiting in
        suspense,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, with his most deprecating
        smile. &ldquo;I hardly think that the time for such questions has come
        yet for me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna looked at each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We can never tell whether the time has come for us or not,&rdquo;
        said Alexey Alexandrovitch severely. &ldquo;We ought not to think
        whether we are ready or not ready. God&rsquo;s grace is not guided by
        human considerations: sometimes it comes not to those that strive for
        it, and comes to those that are unprepared, like Saul.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I believe it won&rsquo;t be just yet,&rdquo; said Lidia
        Ivanovna, who had been meanwhile watching the movements of the
        Frenchman. Landau got up and came to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you allow me to listen?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes; I did not want to disturb you,&rdquo; said Lidia
        Ivanovna, gazing tenderly at him; &ldquo;sit here with us.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;One has only not to close one&rsquo;s eyes to shut out the
        light,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch went on.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, if you knew the happiness we know, feeling His presence ever
        in our hearts!&rdquo; said Countess Lidia Ivanovna with a rapturous
        smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But a man may feel himself unworthy sometimes to rise to that
        height,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, conscious of hypocrisy in
        admitting this religious height, but at the same time unable to bring
        himself to acknowledge his free-thinking views before a person who, by a
        single word to Pomorsky, might procure him the coveted appointment.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?&rdquo; said Lidia
        Ivanovna. &ldquo;But that is a false idea. There is no sin for
        believers, their sin has been atoned for. <i>Pardon,</i>&rdquo; she
        added, looking at the footman, who came in again with another letter.
        She read it and gave a verbal answer: &ldquo;Tomorrow at the Grand
        Duchess&rsquo;s, say.&rdquo; &ldquo;For the believer sin is not,&rdquo;
        she went on.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but faith without works is dead,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, recalling the phrase from the catechism, and only by his
        smile clinging to his independence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There you have it&mdash;from the epistle of St. James,&rdquo;
        said Alexey Alexandrovitch, addressing Lidia Ivanovna, with a certain
        reproachfulness in his tone. It was unmistakably a subject they had
        discussed more than once before. &ldquo;What harm has been done by the
        false interpretation of that passage! Nothing holds men back from belief
        like that misinterpretation. &lsquo;I have not works, so I cannot
        believe,&rsquo; though all the while that is not said. But the very
        opposite is said.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Striving for God, saving the soul by fasting,&rdquo; said
        Countess Lidia Ivanovna, with disgusted contempt, &ldquo;those are the
        crude ideas of our monks.... Yet that is nowhere said. It is far simpler
        and easier,&rdquo; she added, looking at Oblonsky with the same
        encouraging smile with which at court she encouraged youthful maids of
        honor, disconcerted by the new surroundings of the court.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We are saved by Christ who suffered for us. We are saved by
        faith,&rdquo; Alexey Alexandrovitch chimed in, with a glance of approval
        at her words.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>&ldquo;Vous comprenez l&rsquo;anglais?&rdquo;</i> asked Lidia
        Ivanovna, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, she got up and began
        looking through a shelf of books.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I want to read him &lsquo;Safe and Happy,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Under
        the Wing,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said, looking inquiringly at Karenin. And
        finding the book, and sitting down again in her place, she opened it.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very short. In it is described the way by which faith
        can be reached, and the happiness, above all earthly bliss, with which
        it fills the soul. The believer cannot be unhappy because he is not
        alone. But you will see.&rdquo; She was just settling herself to read
        when the footman came in again. &ldquo;Madame Borozdina? Tell her,
        tomorrow at two o&rsquo;clock. Yes,&rdquo; she said, putting her finger
        in the place in the book, and gazing before her with her fine pensive
        eyes, &ldquo;that is how true faith acts. You know Marie Sanina? You
        know about her trouble? She lost her only child. She was in despair. And
        what happened? She found this comforter, and she thanks God now for the
        death of her child. Such is the happiness faith brings!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, that is most....&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch, glad
        they were going to read, and let him have a chance to collect his
        faculties. &ldquo;No, I see I&rsquo;d better not ask her about anything
        today,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;If only I can get out of this without
        putting my foot in it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It will be dull for you,&rdquo; said Countess Lidia Ivanovna,
        addressing Landau; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know English, but it&rsquo;s
        short.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I shall understand,&rdquo; said Landau, with the same smile,
        and he closed his eyes. Alexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna
        exchanged meaningful glances, and the reading began.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 22</h3>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch felt completely nonplussed by the strange talk which
        he was hearing for the first time. The complexity of Petersburg, as a
        rule, had a stimulating effect on him, rousing him out of his Moscow
        stagnation. But he liked these complications, and understood them only
        in the circles he knew and was at home in. In these unfamiliar
        surroundings he was puzzled and disconcerted, and could not get his
        bearings. As he listened to Countess Lidia Ivanovna, aware of the
        beautiful, artless&mdash;or perhaps artful, he could not decide
        which&mdash;eyes of Landau fixed upon him, Stepan Arkadyevitch began to
        be conscious of a peculiar heaviness in his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most incongruous ideas were in confusion in his head. &ldquo;Marie
        Sanina is glad her child&rsquo;s dead.... How good a smoke would be
        now!... To be saved, one need only believe, and the monks don&rsquo;t
        know how the thing&rsquo;s to be done, but Countess Lidia Ivanovna does
        know.... And why is my head so heavy? Is it the cognac, or all this
        being so queer? Anyway, I fancy I&rsquo;ve done nothing unsuitable so
        far. But anyway, it won&rsquo;t do to ask her now. They say they make
        one say one&rsquo;s prayers. I only hope they won&rsquo;t make me!
        That&rsquo;ll be too imbecile. And what stuff it is she&rsquo;s reading!
        but she has a good accent. Landau&mdash;Bezzubov&mdash;what&rsquo;s he
        Bezzubov for?&rdquo; All at once Stepan Arkadyevitch became aware that
        his lower jaw was uncontrollably forming a yawn. He pulled his whiskers
        to cover the yawn, and shook himself together. But soon after he became
        aware that he was dropping asleep and on the very point of snoring. He
        recovered himself at the very moment when the voice of Countess Lidia
        Ivanovna was saying &ldquo;he&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch
        started with dismay, feeling guilty and caught. But he was reassured at
        once by seeing that the words &ldquo;he&rsquo;s asleep&rdquo; referred
        not to him, but to Landau. The Frenchman was asleep as well as Stepan
        Arkadyevitch. But Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s being asleep would have
        offended them, as he thought (though even this, he thought, might not be
        so, as everything seemed so queer), while Landau&rsquo;s being asleep
        delighted them extremely, especially Countess Lidia Ivanovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>&ldquo;Mon ami,&rdquo;</i> said Lidia Ivanovna, carefully holding the
        folds of her silk gown so as not to rustle, and in her excitement
        calling Karenin not Alexey Alexandrovitch, but
        <i>&ldquo;mon ami,&rdquo; &ldquo;donnez-lui la main. Vous voyez?</i>
        Sh!&rdquo; she hissed at the footman as he came in again. &ldquo;Not at
        home.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The Frenchman was asleep, or pretending to be asleep, with his head on
        the back of his chair, and his moist hand, as it lay on his knee, made
        faint movements, as though trying to catch something. Alexey
        Alexandrovitch got up, tried to move carefully, but stumbled against the
        table, went up and laid his hand in the Frenchman&rsquo;s hand. Stepan
        Arkadyevitch got up too, and opening his eyes wide, trying to wake
        himself up if he were asleep, he looked first at one and then at the
        other. It was all real. Stepan Arkadyevitch felt that his head was
        getting worse and worse.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i
          >Que la personne qui est arrivée la dernière, celle qui demande,
          qu&rsquo;elle sorte! Qu&rsquo;elle sorte!</i
        >&rdquo; articulated the Frenchman, without opening his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i
          >Vous m&rsquo;excuserez, mais vous voyez.... Revenez vers dix heures,
          encore mieux demain.</i
        >&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Qu&rsquo;elle sorte!</i>&rdquo; repeated the Frenchman
        impatiently.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est moi, n&rsquo;est-ce pas?</i>&rdquo; And receiving
        an answer in the affirmative, Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgetting the favor
        he had meant to ask of Lidia Ivanovna, and forgetting his sister&rsquo;s
        affairs, caring for nothing, but filled with the sole desire to get away
        as soon as possible, went out on tiptoe and ran out into the street as
        though from a plague-stricken house. For a long while he chatted and
        joked with his cab-driver, trying to recover his spirits.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the French theater where he arrived for the last act, and afterwards
        at the Tatar restaurant after his champagne, Stepan Arkadyevitch felt a
        little refreshed in the atmosphere he was used to. But still he felt
        quite unlike himself all that evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        On getting home to Pyotr Oblonsky&rsquo;s, where he was staying, Stepan
        Arkadyevitch found a note from Betsy. She wrote to him that she was very
        anxious to finish their interrupted conversation, and begged him to come
        next day. He had scarcely read this note, and frowned at its contents,
        when he heard below the ponderous tramp of the servants, carrying
        something heavy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch went out to look. It was the rejuvenated Pyotr
        Oblonsky. He was so drunk that he could not walk upstairs; but he told
        them to set him on his legs when he saw Stepan Arkadyevitch, and
        clinging to him, walked with him into his room and there began telling
        him how he had spent the evening, and fell asleep doing so.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stepan Arkadyevitch was in very low spirits, which happened rarely with
        him, and for a long while he could not go to sleep. Everything he could
        recall to his mind, everything was disgusting; but most disgusting of
        all, as if it were something shameful, was the memory of the evening he
        had spent at Countess Lidia Ivanovna&rsquo;s.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next day he received from Alexey Alexandrovitch a final answer, refusing
        to grant Anna&rsquo;s divorce, and he understood that this decision was
        based on what the Frenchman had said in his real or pretended trance.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 23</h3>

      <p>
        In order to carry through any undertaking in family life, there must
        necessarily be either complete division between the husband and wife, or
        loving agreement. When the relations of a couple are vacillating and
        neither one thing nor the other, no sort of enterprise can be
        undertaken.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many families remain for years in the same place, though both husband
        and wife are sick of it, simply because there is neither complete
        division nor agreement between them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both Vronsky and Anna felt life in Moscow insupportable in the heat and
        dust, when the spring sunshine was followed by the glare of summer, and
        all the trees in the boulevards had long since been in full leaf, and
        the leaves were covered with dust. But they did not go back to
        Vozdvizhenskoe, as they had arranged to do long before; they went on
        staying in Moscow, though they both loathed it, because of late there
        had been no agreement between them.
      </p>

      <p>
        The irritability that kept them apart had no external cause, and all
        efforts to come to an understanding intensified it, instead of removing
        it. It was an inner irritation, grounded in her mind on the conviction
        that his love had grown less; in his, on regret that he had put himself
        for her sake in a difficult position, which she, instead of lightening,
        made still more difficult. Neither of them gave full utterance to their
        sense of grievance, but they considered each other in the wrong, and
        tried on every pretext to prove this to one another.
      </p>

      <p>
        In her eyes the whole of him, with all his habits, ideas, desires, with
        all his spiritual and physical temperament, was one thing&mdash;love for
        women, and that love, she felt, ought to be entirely concentrated on her
        alone. That love was less; consequently, as she reasoned, he must have
        transferred part of his love to other women or to another
        woman&mdash;and she was jealous. She was jealous not of any particular
        woman but of the decrease of his love. Not having got an object for her
        jealousy, she was on the lookout for it. At the slightest hint she
        transferred her jealousy from one object to another. At one time she was
        jealous of those low women with whom he might so easily renew his old
        bachelor ties; then she was jealous of the society women he might meet;
        then she was jealous of the imaginary girl whom he might want to marry,
        for whose sake he would break with her. And this last form of jealousy
        tortured her most of all, especially as he had unwarily told her, in a
        moment of frankness, that his mother knew him so little that she had had
        the audacity to try and persuade him to marry the young Princess
        Sorokina.
      </p>

      <p>
        And being jealous of him, Anna was indignant against him and found
        grounds for indignation in everything. For everything that was difficult
        in her position she blamed him. The agonizing condition of suspense she
        had passed in Moscow, the tardiness and indecision of Alexey
        Alexandrovitch, her solitude&mdash;she put it all down to him. If he had
        loved her he would have seen all the bitterness of her position, and
        would have rescued her from it. For her being in Moscow and not in the
        country, he was to blame too. He could not live buried in the country as
        she would have liked to do. He must have society, and he had put her in
        this awful position, the bitterness of which he would not see. And
        again, it was his fault that she was forever separated from her son.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even the rare moments of tenderness that came from time to time did not
        soothe her; in his tenderness now she saw a shade of complacency, of
        self-confidence, which had not been of old, and which exasperated her.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was dusk. Anna was alone, and waiting for him to come back from a
        bachelor dinner. She walked up and down in his study (the room where the
        noise from the street was least heard), and thought over every detail of
        their yesterday&rsquo;s quarrel. Going back from the well-remembered,
        offensive words of the quarrel to what had been the ground of it, she
        arrived at last at its origin. For a long while she could hardly believe
        that their dissension had arisen from a conversation so inoffensive, of
        so little moment to either. But so it actually had been. It all arose
        from his laughing at the girls&rsquo; high schools, declaring they were
        useless, while she defended them. He had spoken slightingly of
        women&rsquo;s education in general, and had said that Hannah,
        Anna&rsquo;s English protégée, had not the slightest need to know
        anything of physics.
      </p>

      <p>
        This irritated Anna. She saw in this a contemptuous reference to her
        occupations. And she bethought her of a phrase to pay him back for the
        pain he had given her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect you to understand me,
        my feelings, as anyone who loved me might, but simple delicacy I did
        expect,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        And he had actually flushed with vexation, and had said something
        unpleasant. She could not recall her answer, but at that point, with an
        unmistakable desire to wound her too, he had said:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I feel no interest in your infatuation over this girl,
        that&rsquo;s true, because I see it&rsquo;s unnatural.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The cruelty with which he shattered the world she had built up for
        herself so laboriously to enable her to endure her hard life, the
        injustice with which he had accused her of affectation, of
        artificiality, aroused her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very sorry that nothing but what&rsquo;s coarse and material
        is comprehensible and natural to you,&rdquo; she said and walked out of
        the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he had come in to her yesterday evening, they had not referred to
        the quarrel, but both felt that the quarrel had been smoothed over, but
        was not at an end.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today he had not been at home all day, and she felt so lonely and
        wretched in being on bad terms with him that she wanted to forget it
        all, to forgive him, and be reconciled with him; she wanted to throw the
        blame on herself and to justify him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am myself to blame. I&rsquo;m irritable, I&rsquo;m insanely
        jealous. I will make it up with him, and we&rsquo;ll go away to the
        country; there I shall be more at peace.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Unnatural!&rdquo; She suddenly recalled the word that had stung
        her most of all, not so much the word itself as the intent to wound her
        with which it was said. &ldquo;I know what he meant; he
        meant&mdash;unnatural, not loving my own daughter, to love another
        person&rsquo;s child. What does he know of love for children, of my love
        for Seryozha, whom I&rsquo;ve sacrificed for him? But that wish to wound
        me! No, he loves another woman, it must be so.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And perceiving that, while trying to regain her peace of mind, she had
        gone round the same circle that she had been round so often before, and
        had come back to her former state of exasperation, she was horrified at
        herself. &ldquo;Can it be impossible? Can it be beyond me to control
        myself?&rdquo; she said to herself, and began again from the beginning.
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s truthful, he&rsquo;s honest, he loves me. I love him,
        and in a few days the divorce will come. What more do I want? I want
        peace of mind and trust, and I will take the blame on myself. Yes, now
        when he comes in, I will tell him I was wrong, though I was not wrong,
        and we will go away tomorrow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And to escape thinking any more, and being overcome by irritability, she
        rang, and ordered the boxes to be brought up for packing their things
        for the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        At ten o&rsquo;clock Vronsky came in.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 24</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, was it nice?&rdquo; she asked, coming out to meet him with
        a penitent and meek expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Just as usual,&rdquo; he answered, seeing at a glance that she
        was in one of her good moods. He was used by now to these transitions,
        and he was particularly glad to see it today, as he was in a specially
        good humor himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do I see? Come, that&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; he said, pointing
        to the boxes in the passage.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, we must go. I went out for a drive, and it was so fine I
        longed to be in the country. There&rsquo;s nothing to keep you, is
        there?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the one thing I desire. I&rsquo;ll be back directly,
        and we&rsquo;ll talk it over; I only want to change my coat. Order some
        tea.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he went into his room.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was something mortifying in the way he had said &ldquo;Come,
        that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; as one says to a child when it leaves off
        being naughty, and still more mortifying was the contrast between her
        penitent and his self-confident tone; and for one instant she felt the
        lust of strife rising up in her again, but making an effort she
        conquered it, and met Vronsky as good-humoredly as before.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he came in she told him, partly repeating phrases she had prepared
        beforehand, how she had spent the day, and her plans for going away.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You know it came to me almost like an inspiration,&rdquo; she
        said. &ldquo;Why wait here for the divorce? Won&rsquo;t it be just the
        same in the country? I can&rsquo;t wait any longer! I don&rsquo;t want
        to go on hoping, I don&rsquo;t want to hear anything about the divorce.
        I have made up my mind it shall not have any more influence on my life.
        Do you agree?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; he said, glancing uneasily at her excited face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What did you do? Who was there?&rdquo; she said, after a pause.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky mentioned the names of the guests. &ldquo;The dinner was first
        rate, and the boat race, and it was all pleasant enough, but in Moscow
        they can never do anything without something <i>ridicule</i>. A lady of
        a sort appeared on the scene, teacher of swimming to the Queen of
        Sweden, and gave us an exhibition of her skill.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How? did she swim?&rdquo; asked Anna, frowning.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In an absurd red <i>costume de natation;</i> she was old and
        hideous too. So when shall we go?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What an absurd fancy! Why, did she swim in some special way,
        then?&rdquo; said Anna, not answering.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There was absolutely nothing in it. That&rsquo;s just what I say,
        it was awfully stupid. Well, then, when do you think of going?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna shook her head as though trying to drive away some unpleasant idea.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;When? Why, the sooner the better! By tomorrow we shan&rsquo;t be
        ready. The day after tomorrow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes ... oh, no, wait a minute! The day after tomorrow&rsquo;s
        Sunday, I have to be at maman&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Vronsky, embarrassed,
        because as soon as he uttered his mother&rsquo;s name he was aware of
        her intent, suspicious eyes. His embarrassment confirmed her suspicion.
        She flushed hotly and drew away from him. It was now not the Queen of
        Sweden&rsquo;s swimming-mistress who filled Anna&rsquo;s imagination,
        but the young Princess Sorokina. She was staying in a village near
        Moscow with Countess Vronskaya.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you go tomorrow?&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, no! The deeds and the money for the business I&rsquo;m
        going there for I can&rsquo;t get by tomorrow,&rdquo; he answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If so, we won&rsquo;t go at all.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But why so?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall not go later. Monday or never!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; said Vronsky, as though in amazement.
        &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s no meaning in it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no meaning in it to you, because you care nothing
        for me. You don&rsquo;t care to understand my life. The one thing that I
        cared for here was Hannah. You say it&rsquo;s affectation. Why, you said
        yesterday that I don&rsquo;t love my daughter, that I love this English
        girl, that it&rsquo;s unnatural. I should like to know what life there
        is for me that could be natural!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        For an instant she had a clear vision of what she was doing, and was
        horrified at how she had fallen away from her resolution. But even
        though she knew it was her own ruin, she could not restrain herself,
        could not keep herself from proving to him that he was wrong, could not
        give way to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I never said that; I said I did not sympathize with this sudden
        passion.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How is it, though you boast of your straightforwardness, you
        don&rsquo;t tell the truth?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I never boast, and I never tell lies,&rdquo; he said slowly,
        restraining his rising anger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great pity if you
        can&rsquo;t respect....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should
        be. And if you don&rsquo;t love me any more, it would be better and more
        honest to say so.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, this is becoming unbearable!&rdquo; cried Vronsky, getting up
        from his chair; and stopping short, facing her, he said, speaking
        deliberately: &ldquo;What do you try my patience for?&rdquo; looking as
        though he might have said much more, but was restraining himself.
        &ldquo;It has limits.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; she cried, looking with terror
        at the undisguised hatred in his whole face, and especially in his
        cruel, menacing eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I mean to say....&rdquo; he was beginning, but he checked
        himself. &ldquo;I must ask what it is you want of me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What can I want? All I can want is that you should not desert me,
        as you think of doing,&rdquo; she said, understanding all he had not
        uttered. &ldquo;But that I don&rsquo;t want; that&rsquo;s secondary. I
        want love, and there is none. So then all is over.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She turned towards the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Stop! sto-op!&rdquo; said Vronsky, with no change in the gloomy
        lines of his brows, though he held her by the hand. &ldquo;What is it
        all about? I said that we must put off going for three days, and on that
        you told me I was lying, that I was not an honorable man.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, and I repeat that the man who reproaches me with having
        sacrificed everything for me,&rdquo; she said, recalling the words of a
        still earlier quarrel, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;s worse than a dishonorable
        man&mdash;he&rsquo;s a heartless man.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, there are limits to endurance!&rdquo; he cried, and hastily
        let go her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He hates me, that&rsquo;s clear,&rdquo; she thought, and in
        silence, without looking round, she walked with faltering steps out of
        the room. &ldquo;He loves another woman, that&rsquo;s even
        clearer,&rdquo; she said to herself as she went into her own room.
        &ldquo;I want love, and there is none. So, then, all is over.&rdquo; She
        repeated the words she had said, &ldquo;and it must be ended.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But how?&rdquo; she asked herself, and she sat down in a low
        chair before the looking-glass.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thoughts of where she would go now, whether to the aunt who had brought
        her up, to Dolly, or simply alone abroad, and of what <i>he</i> was
        doing now alone in his study; whether this was the final quarrel, or
        whether reconciliation were still possible; and of what all her old
        friends at Petersburg would say of her now; and of how Alexey
        Alexandrovitch would look at it, and many other ideas of what would
        happen now after this rupture, came into her head; but she did not give
        herself up to them with all her heart. At the bottom of her heart was
        some obscure idea that alone interested her, but she could not get clear
        sight of it. Thinking once more of Alexey Alexandrovitch, she recalled
        the time of her illness after her confinement, and the feeling which
        never left her at that time. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I die?&rdquo; and
        the words and the feeling of that time came back to her. And all at once
        she knew what was in her soul. Yes, it was that idea which alone solved
        all. &ldquo;Yes, to die!... And the shame and disgrace of Alexey
        Alexandrovitch and of Seryozha, and my awful shame, it will all be saved
        by death. To die! and he will feel remorse; will be sorry; will love me;
        he will suffer on my account.&rdquo; With the trace of a smile of
        commiseration for herself she sat down in the armchair, taking off and
        putting on the rings on her left hand, vividly picturing from different
        sides his feelings after her death.
      </p>

      <p>
        Approaching footsteps&mdash;his steps&mdash;distracted her attention. As
        though absorbed in the arrangement of her rings, she did not even turn
        to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He went up to her, and taking her by the hand, said softly:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna, we&rsquo;ll go the day after tomorrow, if you like. I agree
        to everything.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She did not speak.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he urged.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said, and at the same instant, unable to
        restrain herself any longer, she burst into sobs.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Cast me off!&rdquo; she articulated between her sobs.
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go away tomorrow ... I&rsquo;ll do more. What am I? An
        immoral woman! A stone round your neck. I don&rsquo;t want to make you
        wretched, I don&rsquo;t want to! I&rsquo;ll set you free. You
        don&rsquo;t love me; you love someone else!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky besought her to be calm, and declared that there was no trace of
        foundation for her jealousy; that he had never ceased, and never would
        cease, to love her; that he loved her more than ever.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna, why distress yourself and me so?&rdquo; he said to her,
        kissing her hands. There was tenderness now in his face, and she fancied
        she caught the sound of tears in his voice, and she felt them wet on her
        hand. And instantly Anna&rsquo;s despairing jealousy changed to a
        despairing passion of tenderness. She put her arms round him, and
        covered with kisses his head, his neck, his hands.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 25</h3>

      <p>
        Feeling that the reconciliation was complete, Anna set eagerly to work
        in the morning preparing for their departure. Though it was not settled
        whether they should go on Monday or Tuesday, as they had each given way
        to the other, Anna packed busily, feeling absolutely indifferent whether
        they went a day earlier or later. She was standing in her room over an
        open box, taking things out of it, when he came in to see her earlier
        than usual, dressed to go out.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going off at once to see maman; she can send me the
        money by Yegorov. And I shall be ready to go tomorrow,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though she was in such a good mood, the thought of his visit to his
        mother&rsquo;s gave her a pang.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t be ready by then myself,&rdquo; she said; and
        at once reflected, &ldquo;so then it was possible to arrange to do as I
        wished.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, do as you meant to do. Go into the
        dining-room, I&rsquo;m coming directly. It&rsquo;s only to turn out
        those things that aren&rsquo;t wanted,&rdquo; she said, putting
        something more on the heap of frippery that lay in Annushka&rsquo;s
        arms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky was eating his beefsteak when she came into the dining-room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how distasteful these rooms have
        become to me,&rdquo; she said, sitting down beside him to her coffee.
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more awful than these
        <i>chambres garnies</i>. There&rsquo;s no individuality in them, no
        soul. These clocks, and curtains, and, worst of all, the
        wallpapers&mdash;they&rsquo;re a nightmare. I think of Vozdvizhenskoe as
        the promised land. You&rsquo;re not sending the horses off yet?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, they will come after us. Where are you going to?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I wanted to go to Wilson&rsquo;s to take some dresses to her. So
        it&rsquo;s really to be tomorrow?&rdquo; she said in a cheerful voice;
        but suddenly her face changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky&rsquo;s valet came in to ask him to sign a receipt for a
        telegram from Petersburg. There was nothing out of the way in
        Vronsky&rsquo;s getting a telegram, but he said, as though anxious to
        conceal something from her, that the receipt was in his study, and he
        turned hurriedly to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;By tomorrow, without fail, I will finish it all.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;From whom is the telegram?&rdquo; she asked, not hearing him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;From Stiva,&rdquo; he answered reluctantly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you show it to me? What secret can there be
        between Stiva and me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky called the valet back, and told him to bring the telegram.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to show it to you, because Stiva has such a
        passion for telegraphing: why telegraph when nothing is settled?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;About the divorce?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but he says he has not been able to come at anything yet. He
        has promised a decisive answer in a day or two. But here it is; read
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        With trembling hands Anna took the telegram, and read what Vronsky had
        told her. At the end was added: &ldquo;Little hope; but I will do
        everything possible and impossible.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I said yesterday that it&rsquo;s absolutely nothing to me when I
        get, or whether I never get, a divorce,&rdquo; she said, flushing
        crimson. &ldquo;There was not the slightest necessity to hide it from
        me.&rdquo; &ldquo;So he may hide and does hide his correspondence with
        women from me,&rdquo; she thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yashvin meant to come this morning with Voytov,&rdquo; said
        Vronsky; &ldquo;I believe he&rsquo;s won from Pyevtsov all and more than
        he can pay, about sixty thousand.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, irritated by his so obviously showing by
        this change of subject that he was irritated, &ldquo;why did you suppose
        that this news would affect me so, that you must even try to hide it? I
        said I don&rsquo;t want to consider it, and I should have liked you to
        care as little about it as I do.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I care about it because I like definiteness,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Definiteness is not in the form but the love,&rdquo; she said,
        more and more irritated, not by his words, but by the tone of cool
        composure in which he spoke. &ldquo;What do you want it for?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My God! love again,&rdquo; he thought, frowning.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, you know what for; for your sake and your children&rsquo;s in
        the future.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be children in the future.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great pity,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You want it for the children&rsquo;s sake, but you don&rsquo;t
        think of me?&rdquo; she said, quite forgetting or not having heard that
        he had said, &ldquo;<i>For your sake</i> and the
        children&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The question of the possibility of having children had long been a
        subject of dispute and irritation to her. His desire to have children
        she interpreted as a proof he did not prize her beauty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I said: for your sake. Above all for your sake,&rdquo; he
        repeated, frowning as though in pain, &ldquo;because I am certain that
        the greater part of your irritability comes from the indefiniteness of
        the position.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, now he has laid aside all pretense, and all his cold hatred
        for me is apparent,&rdquo; she thought, not hearing his words, but
        watching with terror the cold, cruel judge who looked mocking her out of
        his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The cause is not that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and, indeed, I
        don&rsquo;t see how the cause of my irritability, as you call it, can be
        that I am completely in your power. What indefiniteness is there in the
        position? on the contrary....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very sorry that you don&rsquo;t care to understand,&rdquo;
        he interrupted, obstinately anxious to give utterance to his thought.
        &ldquo;The indefiniteness consists in your imagining that I am
        free.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;On that score you can set your mind quite at rest,&rdquo; she
        said, and turning away from him, she began drinking her coffee.
      </p>

      <p>
        She lifted her cup, with her little finger held apart, and put it to her
        lips. After drinking a few sips she glanced at him, and by his
        expression, she saw clearly that he was repelled by her hand, and her
        gesture, and the sound made by her lips.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care in the least what your mother thinks, and what
        match she wants to make for you,&rdquo; she said, putting the cup down
        with a shaking hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But we are not talking about that.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s just what we are talking about. And let me tell
        you that a heartless woman, whether she&rsquo;s old or not old, your
        mother or anyone else, is of no consequence to me, and I would not
        consent to know her.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna, I beg you not to speak disrespectfully of my mother.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A woman whose heart does not tell her where her son&rsquo;s
        happiness and honor lie has no heart.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I repeat my request that you will not speak disrespectfully of my
        mother, whom I respect,&rdquo; he said, raising his voice and looking
        sternly at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        She did not answer. Looking intently at him, at his face, his hands, she
        recalled all the details of their reconciliation the previous day, and
        his passionate caresses. &ldquo;There, just such caresses he has
        lavished, and will lavish, and longs to lavish on other women!&rdquo;
        she thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t love your mother. That&rsquo;s all talk, and
        talk, and talk!&rdquo; she said, looking at him with hatred in her eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Even if so, you must....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Must decide, and I have decided,&rdquo; she said, and she would
        have gone away, but at that moment Yashvin walked into the room. Anna
        greeted him and remained.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why, when there was a tempest in her soul, and she felt she was standing
        at a turning point in her life, which might have fearful
        consequences&mdash;why, at that minute, she had to keep up appearances
        before an outsider, who sooner or later must know it all&mdash;she did
        not know. But at once quelling the storm within her, she sat down and
        began talking to their guest.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, how are you getting on? Has your debt been paid you?&rdquo;
        she asked Yashvin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, pretty fair; I fancy I shan&rsquo;t get it all, but I shall
        get a good half. And when are you off?&rdquo; said Yashvin, looking at
        Vronsky, and unmistakably guessing at a quarrel.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The day after tomorrow, I think,&rdquo; said Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been meaning to go so long, though.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But now it&rsquo;s quite decided,&rdquo; said Anna, looking
        Vronsky straight in the face with a look which told him not to dream of
        the possibility of reconciliation.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel sorry for that unlucky Pyevtsov?&rdquo; she
        went on, talking to Yashvin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never asked myself the question, Anna Arkadyevna,
        whether I&rsquo;m sorry for him or not. You see, all my fortune&rsquo;s
        here&rdquo;&mdash;he touched his breast pocket&mdash;&ldquo;and just now
        I&rsquo;m a wealthy man. But today I&rsquo;m going to the club, and I
        may come out a beggar. You see, whoever sits down to play with
        me&mdash;he wants to leave me without a shirt to my back, and so do I
        him. And so we fight it out, and that&rsquo;s the pleasure of it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, but suppose you were married,&rdquo; said Anna, &ldquo;how
        would it be for your wife?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Yashvin laughed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not married, and never mean to
        be.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And Helsingfors?&rdquo; said Vronsky, entering into the
        conversation and glancing at Anna&rsquo;s smiling face. Meeting his
        eyes, Anna&rsquo;s face instantly took a coldly severe expression as
        though she were saying to him: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not forgotten.
        It&rsquo;s all the same.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Were you really in love?&rdquo; she said to Yashvin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh heavens! ever so many times! But you see, some men can play
        but only so that they can always lay down their cards when the hour of a
        <i>rendezvous</i> comes, while I can take up love, but only so as not to
        be late for my cards in the evening. That&rsquo;s how I manage
        things.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t mean that, but the real thing.&rdquo; She
        would have said <i>Helsingfors</i>, but would not repeat the word used
        by Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        Voytov, who was buying the horse, came in. Anna got up and went out of
        the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before leaving the house, Vronsky went into her room. She would have
        pretended to be looking for something on the table, but ashamed of
        making a pretense, she looked straight in his face with cold eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she asked in French.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To get the guarantee for Gambetta, I&rsquo;ve sold him,&rdquo; he
        said, in a tone which said more clearly than words, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no
        time for discussing things, and it would lead to nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not to blame in any way,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;If
        she will punish herself, <i>tant pis pour elle.</i> But as he was going
        he fancied that she said something, and his heart suddenly ached with
        pity for her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Eh, Anna?&rdquo; he queried.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I said nothing,&rdquo; she answered just as coldly and calmly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, nothing, <i>tant pis</i> then,&rdquo; he thought, feeling
        cold again, and he turned and went out. As he was going out he caught a
        glimpse in the looking-glass of her face, white, with quivering lips. He
        even wanted to stop and to say some comforting word to her, but his legs
        carried him out of the room before he could think what to say. The whole
        of that day he spent away from home, and when he came in late in the
        evening the maid told him that Anna Arkadyevna had a headache and begged
        him not to go in to her.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 26</h3>

      <p>
        Never before had a day been passed in quarrel. Today was the first time.
        And this was not a quarrel. It was the open acknowledgment of complete
        coldness. Was it possible to glance at her as he had glanced when he
        came into the room for the guarantee?&mdash;to look at her, see her
        heart was breaking with despair, and go out without a word with that
        face of callous composure? He was not merely cold to her, he hated her
        because he loved another woman&mdash;that was clear.
      </p>

      <p>
        And remembering all the cruel words he had said, Anna supplied, too, the
        words that he had unmistakably wished to say and could have said to her,
        and she grew more and more exasperated.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t prevent you,&rdquo; he might say. &ldquo;You can go
        where you like. You were unwilling to be divorced from your husband, no
        doubt so that you might go back to him. Go back to him. If you want
        money, I&rsquo;ll give it to you. How many roubles do you want?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        All the most cruel words that a brutal man could say, he said to her in
        her imagination, and she could not forgive him for them, as though he
        had actually said them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t he only yesterday swear he loved me, he, a
        truthful and sincere man? Haven&rsquo;t I despaired for nothing many
        times already?&rdquo; she said to herself afterwards.
      </p>

      <p>
        All that day, except for the visit to Wilson&rsquo;s, which occupied two
        hours, Anna spent in doubts whether everything were over or whether
        there were still hope of reconciliation, whether she should go away at
        once or see him once more. She was expecting him the whole day, and in
        the evening, as she went to her own room, leaving a message for him that
        her head ached, she said to herself, &ldquo;If he comes in spite of what
        the maid says, it means that he loves me still. If not, it means that
        all is over, and then I will decide what I&rsquo;m to do!...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        In the evening she heard the rumbling of his carriage stop at the
        entrance, his ring, his steps and his conversation with the servant; he
        believed what was told him, did not care to find out more, and went to
        his own room. So then everything was over.
      </p>

      <p>
        And death rose clearly and vividly before her mind as the sole means of
        bringing back love for her in his heart, of punishing him and of gaining
        the victory in that strife which the evil spirit in possession of her
        heart was waging with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now nothing mattered: going or not going to Vozdvizhenskoe, getting or
        not getting a divorce from her husband&mdash;all that did not matter.
        The one thing that mattered was punishing him. When she poured herself
        out her usual dose of opium, and thought that she had only to drink off
        the whole bottle to die, it seemed to her so simple and easy, that she
        began musing with enjoyment on how he would suffer, and repent and love
        her memory when it would be too late. She lay in bed with open eyes, by
        the light of a single burned-down candle, gazing at the carved cornice
        of the ceiling and at the shadow of the screen that covered part of it,
        while she vividly pictured to herself how he would feel when she would
        be no more, when she would be only a memory to him. &ldquo;How could I
        say such cruel things to her?&rdquo; he would say. &ldquo;How could I go
        out of the room without saying anything to her? But now she is no more.
        She has gone away from us forever. She is....&rdquo; Suddenly the shadow
        of the screen wavered, pounced on the whole cornice, the whole ceiling;
        other shadows from the other side swooped to meet it, for an instant the
        shadows flitted back, but then with fresh swiftness they darted forward,
        wavered, commingled, and all was darkness. &ldquo;Death!&rdquo; she
        thought. And such horror came upon her that for a long while she could
        not realize where she was, and for a long while her trembling hands
        could not find the matches and light another candle, instead of the one
        that had burned down and gone out. &ldquo;No, anything&mdash;only to
        live! Why, I love him! Why, he loves me! This has been before and will
        pass,&rdquo; she said, feeling that tears of joy at the return to life
        were trickling down her cheeks. And to escape from her panic she went
        hurriedly to his room.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was asleep there, and sleeping soundly. She went up to him, and
        holding the light above his face, she gazed a long while at him. Now
        when he was asleep, she loved him so that at the sight of him she could
        not keep back tears of tenderness. But she knew that if he waked up he
        would look at her with cold eyes, convinced that he was right, and that
        before telling him of her love, she would have to prove to him that he
        had been wrong in his treatment of her. Without waking him, she went
        back, and after a second dose of opium she fell towards morning into a
        heavy, incomplete sleep, during which she never quite lost
        consciousness.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the morning she was waked by a horrible nightmare, which had recurred
        several times in her dreams, even before her connection with Vronsky. A
        little old man with unkempt beard was doing something bent down over
        some iron, muttering meaningless French words, and she, as she always
        did in this nightmare (it was what made the horror of it), felt that
        this peasant was taking no notice of her, but was doing something
        horrible with the iron&mdash;over her. And she waked up in a cold sweat.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she got up, the previous day came back to her as though veiled in
        mist.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There was a quarrel. Just what has happened several times. I said
        I had a headache, and he did not come in to see me. Tomorrow we&rsquo;re
        going away; I must see him and get ready for the journey,&rdquo; she
        said to herself. And learning that he was in his study, she went down to
        him. As she passed through the drawing-room she heard a carriage stop at
        the entrance, and looking out of the window she saw the carriage, from
        which a young girl in a lilac hat was leaning out giving some direction
        to the footman ringing the bell. After a parley in the hall, someone
        came upstairs, and Vronsky&rsquo;s steps could be heard passing the
        drawing-room. He went rapidly downstairs. Anna went again to the window.
        She saw him come out onto the steps without his hat and go up to the
        carriage. The young girl in the lilac hat handed him a parcel. Vronsky,
        smiling, said something to her. The carriage drove away, he ran rapidly
        upstairs again.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mists that had shrouded everything in her soul parted suddenly. The
        feelings of yesterday pierced the sick heart with a fresh pang. She
        could not understand now how she could have lowered herself by spending
        a whole day with him in his house. She went into his room to announce
        her determination.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That was Madame Sorokina and her daughter. They came and brought
        me the money and the deeds from maman. I couldn&rsquo;t get them
        yesterday. How is your head, better?&rdquo; he said quietly, not wishing
        to see and to understand the gloomy and solemn expression of her face.
      </p>

      <p>
        She looked silently, intently at him, standing in the middle of the
        room. He glanced at her, frowned for a moment, and went on reading a
        letter. She turned, and went deliberately out of the room. He still
        might have turned her back, but she had reached the door, he was still
        silent, and the only sound audible was the rustling of the note paper as
        he turned it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, by the way,&rdquo; he said at the very moment she was in the
        doorway, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going tomorrow for certain, aren&rsquo;t
        we?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You, but not I,&rdquo; she said, turning round to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Anna, we can&rsquo;t go on like this....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You, but not I,&rdquo; she repeated.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This is getting unbearable!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You ... you will be sorry for this,&rdquo; she said, and went
        out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Frightened by the desperate expression with which these words were
        uttered, he jumped up and would have run after her, but on second
        thoughts he sat down and scowled, setting his teeth. This
        vulgar&mdash;as he thought it&mdash;threat of something vague
        exasperated him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried everything,&rdquo; he thought;
        &ldquo;the only thing left is not to pay attention,&rdquo; and he began
        to get ready to drive into town, and again to his mother&rsquo;s to get
        her signature to the deeds.
      </p>

      <p>
        She heard the sound of his steps about the study and the dining-room. At
        the drawing-room he stood still. But he did not turn in to see her, he
        merely gave an order that the horse should be given to Voytov if he came
        while he was away. Then she heard the carriage brought round, the door
        opened, and he came out again. But he went back into the porch again,
        and someone was running upstairs. It was the valet running up for his
        gloves that had been forgotten. She went to the window and saw him take
        the gloves without looking, and touching the coachman on the back he
        said something to him. Then without looking up at the window he settled
        himself in his usual attitude in the carriage, with his legs crossed,
        and drawing on his gloves he vanished round the corner.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 27</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He has gone! It is over!&rdquo; Anna said to herself, standing at
        the window; and in answer to this statement the impression of the
        darkness when the candle had flickered out, and of her fearful dream
        mingling into one, filled her heart with cold terror.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, that cannot be!&rdquo; she cried, and crossing the room she
        rang the bell. She was so afraid now of being alone, that without
        waiting for the servant to come in, she went out to meet him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Inquire where the count has gone,&rdquo; she said. The servant
        answered that the count had gone to the stable.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;His honor left word that if you cared to drive out, the carriage
        would be back immediately.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very good. Wait a minute. I&rsquo;ll write a note at once. Send
        Mihail with the note to the stables. Make haste.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She sat down and wrote:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I was wrong. Come back home; I must explain. For God&rsquo;s sake
        come! I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She sealed it up and gave it to the servant.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was afraid of being left alone now; she followed the servant out of
        the room, and went to the nursery.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, this isn&rsquo;t it, this isn&rsquo;t he! Where are his blue
        eyes, his sweet, shy smile?&rdquo; was her first thought when she saw
        her chubby, rosy little girl with her black, curly hair instead of
        Seryozha, whom in the tangle of her ideas she had expected to see in the
        nursery. The little girl sitting at the table was obstinately and
        violently battering on it with a cork, and staring aimlessly at her
        mother with her pitch-black eyes. Answering the English nurse that she
        was quite well, and that she was going to the country tomorrow, Anna sat
        down by the little girl and began spinning the cork to show her. But the
        child&rsquo;s loud, ringing laugh, and the motion of her eyebrows,
        recalled Vronsky so vividly that she got up hurriedly, restraining her
        sobs, and went away. &ldquo;Can it be all over? No, it cannot be!&rdquo;
        she thought. &ldquo;He will come back. But how can he explain that
        smile, that excitement after he had been talking to her? But even if he
        doesn&rsquo;t explain, I will believe. If I don&rsquo;t believe,
        there&rsquo;s only one thing left for me, and I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She looked at her watch. Twenty minutes had passed. &ldquo;By now he has
        received the note and is coming back. Not long, ten minutes more.... But
        what if he doesn&rsquo;t come? No, that cannot be. He mustn&rsquo;t see
        me with tear-stained eyes. I&rsquo;ll go and wash. Yes, yes; did I do my
        hair or not?&rdquo; she asked herself. And she could not remember. She
        felt her head with her hand. &ldquo;Yes, my hair has been done, but when
        I did it I can&rsquo;t in the least remember.&rdquo; She could not
        believe the evidence of her hand, and went up to the pier-glass to see
        whether she really had done her hair. She certainly had, but she could
        not think when she had done it. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she
        thought, looking in the looking-glass at the swollen face with strangely
        glittering eyes, that looked in a scared way at her. &ldquo;Why,
        it&rsquo;s I!&rdquo; she suddenly understood, and looking round, she
        seemed all at once to feel his kisses on her, and twitched her
        shoulders, shuddering. Then she lifted her hand to her lips and kissed
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it? Why, I&rsquo;m going out of my mind!&rdquo; and she
        went into her bedroom, where Annushka was tidying the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Annushka,&rdquo; she said, coming to a standstill before her, and
        she stared at the maid, not knowing what to say to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You meant to go and see Darya Alexandrovna,&rdquo; said the girl,
        as though she understood.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Darya Alexandrovna? Yes, I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Fifteen minutes there, fifteen minutes back. He&rsquo;s coming,
        he&rsquo;ll be here soon.&rdquo; She took out her watch and looked at
        it. &ldquo;But how could he go away, leaving me in such a state? How can
        he live, without making it up with me?&rdquo; She went to the window and
        began looking into the street. Judging by the time, he might be back
        now. But her calculations might be wrong, and she began once more to
        recall when he had started and to count the minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the moment when she had moved away to the big clock to compare it
        with her watch, someone drove up. Glancing out of the window, she saw
        his carriage. But no one came upstairs, and voices could be heard below.
        It was the messenger who had come back in the carriage. She went down to
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t catch the count. The count had driven off on the
        lower city road.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you say? What!...&rdquo; she said to the rosy,
        good-humored Mihail, as he handed her back her note.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, then, he has never received it!&rdquo; she thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Go with this note to Countess Vronskaya&rsquo;s place, you know?
        and bring an answer back immediately,&rdquo; she said to the messenger.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And I, what am I going to do?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Yes,
        I&rsquo;m going to Dolly&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s true or else I shall go
        out of my mind. Yes, and I can telegraph, too.&rdquo; And she wrote a
        telegram. &ldquo;I absolutely must talk to you; come at once.&rdquo;
        After sending off the telegram, she went to dress. When she was dressed
        and in her hat, she glanced again into the eyes of the plump,
        comfortable-looking Annushka. There was unmistakable sympathy in those
        good-natured little gray eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Annushka, dear, what am I to do?&rdquo; said Anna, sobbing and
        sinking helplessly into a chair.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why fret yourself so, Anna Arkadyevna? Why, there&rsquo;s nothing
        out of the way. You drive out a little, and it&rsquo;ll cheer you
        up,&rdquo; said the maid.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; said Anna, rousing herself and
        getting up. &ldquo;And if there&rsquo;s a telegram while I&rsquo;m away,
        send it on to Darya Alexandrovna&rsquo;s ... but no, I shall be back
        myself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I mustn&rsquo;t think, I must do something, drive somewhere,
        and most of all, get out of this house,&rdquo; she said, feeling with
        terror the strange turmoil going on in her own heart, and she made haste
        to go out and get into the carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; asked Pyotr before getting onto the box.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To Znamenka, the Oblonskys&rsquo;.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 28</h3>

      <p>
        It was bright and sunny. A fine rain had been falling all the morning,
        and now it had not long cleared up. The iron roofs, the flags of the
        roads, the flints of the pavements, the wheels and leather, the brass
        and the tinplate of the carriages&mdash;all glistened brightly in the
        May sunshine. It was three o&rsquo;clock, and the very liveliest time in
        the streets.
      </p>

      <p>
        As she sat in a corner of the comfortable carriage, that hardly swayed
        on its supple springs, while the grays trotted swiftly, in the midst of
        the unceasing rattle of wheels and the changing impressions in the pure
        air, Anna ran over the events of the last days, and she saw her position
        quite differently from how it had seemed at home. Now the thought of
        death seemed no longer so terrible and so clear to her, and death itself
        no longer seemed so inevitable. Now she blamed herself for the
        humiliation to which she had lowered herself. &ldquo;I entreat him to
        forgive me. I have given in to him. I have owned myself in fault. What
        for? Can&rsquo;t I live without him?&rdquo; And leaving unanswered the
        question how she was going to live without him, she fell to reading the
        signs on the shops. &ldquo;Office and warehouse. Dental surgeon. Yes,
        I&rsquo;ll tell Dolly all about it. She doesn&rsquo;t like Vronsky. I
        shall be sick and ashamed, but I&rsquo;ll tell her. She loves me, and
        I&rsquo;ll follow her advice. I won&rsquo;t give in to him; I
        won&rsquo;t let him train me as he pleases. Filippov, bun shop. They say
        they send their dough to Petersburg. The Moscow water is so good for it.
        Ah, the springs at Mitishtchen, and the pancakes!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And she remembered how, long, long ago, when she was a girl of
        seventeen, she had gone with her aunt to Troitsa. &ldquo;Riding, too.
        Was that really me, with red hands? How much that seemed to me then
        splendid and out of reach has become worthless, while what I had then
        has gone out of my reach forever! Could I ever have believed then that I
        could come to such humiliation? How conceited and self-satisfied he will
        be when he gets my note! But I will show him.... How horrid that paint
        smells! Why is it they&rsquo;re always painting and building?
        <i>Modes et robes</i>, she read. A man bowed to her. It was
        Annushka&rsquo;s husband. &ldquo;Our parasites&rdquo;; she remembered
        how Vronsky had said that. &ldquo;Our? Why our? What&rsquo;s so awful is
        that one can&rsquo;t tear up the past by its roots. One can&rsquo;t tear
        it out, but one can hide one&rsquo;s memory of it. And I&rsquo;ll hide
        it.&rdquo; And then she thought of her past with Alexey Alexandrovitch,
        of how she had blotted the memory of it out of her life. &ldquo;Dolly
        will think I&rsquo;m leaving my second husband, and so I certainly must
        be in the wrong. As if I cared to be right! I can&rsquo;t help
        it!&rdquo; she said, and she wanted to cry. But at once she fell to
        wondering what those two girls could be smiling about. &ldquo;Love, most
        likely. They don&rsquo;t know how dreary it is, how low.... The
        boulevard and the children. Three boys running, playing at horses.
        Seryozha! And I&rsquo;m losing everything and not getting him back. Yes,
        I&rsquo;m losing everything, if he doesn&rsquo;t return. Perhaps he was
        late for the train and has come back by now. Longing for humiliation
        again!&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll go to Dolly,
        and say straight out to her, I&rsquo;m unhappy, I deserve this,
        I&rsquo;m to blame, but still I&rsquo;m unhappy, help me. These horses,
        this carriage&mdash;how loathsome I am to myself in this
        carriage&mdash;all his; but I won&rsquo;t see them again.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Thinking over the words in which she would tell Dolly, and mentally
        working her heart up to great bitterness, Anna went upstairs.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is there anyone with her?&rdquo; she asked in the hall.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Katerina Alexandrovna Levin,&rdquo; answered the footman.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kitty! Kitty, whom Vronsky was in love with!&rdquo; thought Anna,
        &ldquo;the girl he thinks of with love. He&rsquo;s sorry he didn&rsquo;t
        marry her. But me he thinks of with hatred, and is sorry he had anything
        to do with me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The sisters were having a consultation about nursing when Anna called.
        Dolly went down alone to see the visitor who had interrupted their
        conversation.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, so you&rsquo;ve not gone away yet? I meant to have come to
        you,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I had a letter from Stiva today.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We had a telegram too,&rdquo; answered Anna, looking round for
        Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He writes that he can&rsquo;t make out quite what Alexey
        Alexandrovitch wants, but he won&rsquo;t go away without a decisive
        answer.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I thought you had someone with you. Can I see the letter?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; Kitty,&rdquo; said Dolly, embarrassed. &ldquo;She stayed in
        the nursery. She has been very ill.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So I heard. May I see the letter?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it directly. But he doesn&rsquo;t refuse; on the
        contrary, Stiva has hopes,&rdquo; said Dolly, stopping in the doorway.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t, and indeed I don&rsquo;t wish it,&rdquo; said
        Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Does Kitty consider it degrading to meet
        me?&rdquo; thought Anna when she was alone. &ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;s
        right, too. But it&rsquo;s not for her, the girl who was in love with
        Vronsky, it&rsquo;s not for her to show me that, even if it is true. I
        know that in my position I can&rsquo;t be received by any decent woman.
        I knew that from the first moment I sacrificed everything to him. And
        this is my reward! Oh, how I hate him! And what did I come here for?
        I&rsquo;m worse here, more miserable.&rdquo; She heard from the next
        room the sisters&rsquo; voices in consultation. &ldquo;And what am I
        going to say to Dolly now? Amuse Kitty by the sight of my wretchedness,
        submit to her patronizing? No; and besides, Dolly wouldn&rsquo;t
        understand. And it would be no good my telling her. It would only be
        interesting to see Kitty, to show her how I despise everyone and
        everything, how nothing matters to me now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly came in with the letter. Anna read it and handed it back in
        silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I knew all that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and it doesn&rsquo;t
        interest me in the least.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, why so? On the contrary, I have hopes,&rdquo; said Dolly,
        looking inquisitively at Anna. She had never seen her in such a
        strangely irritable condition. &ldquo;When are you going away?&rdquo;
        she asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna, half-closing her eyes, looked straight before her and did not
        answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why does Kitty shrink from me?&rdquo; she said, looking at the
        door and flushing red.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, what nonsense! She&rsquo;s nursing, and things aren&rsquo;t
        going right with her, and I&rsquo;ve been advising her.... She&rsquo;s
        delighted. She&rsquo;ll be here in a minute,&rdquo; said Dolly
        awkwardly, not clever at lying. &ldquo;Yes, here she is.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Hearing that Anna had called, Kitty had wanted not to appear, but Dolly
        persuaded her. Rallying her forces, Kitty went in, walked up to her,
        blushing, and shook hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am so glad to see you,&rdquo; she said with a trembling voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty had been thrown into confusion by the inward conflict between her
        antagonism to this bad woman and her desire to be nice to her. But as
        soon as she saw Anna&rsquo;s lovely and attractive face, all feeling of
        antagonism disappeared.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I should not have been surprised if you had not cared to meet me.
        I&rsquo;m used to everything. You have been ill? Yes, you are
        changed,&rdquo; said Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty felt that Anna was looking at her with hostile eyes. She ascribed
        this hostility to the awkward position in which Anna, who had once
        patronized her, must feel with her now, and she felt sorry for her.
      </p>

      <p>
        They talked of Kitty&rsquo;s illness, of the baby, of Stiva, but it was
        obvious that nothing interested Anna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I came to say good-bye to you,&rdquo; she said, getting up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, when are you going?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But again not answering, Anna turned to Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I am very glad to have seen you,&rdquo; she said with a
        smile. &ldquo;I have heard so much of you from everyone, even from your
        husband. He came to see me, and I liked him exceedingly,&rdquo; she
        said, unmistakably with malicious intent. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He has gone back to the country,&rdquo; said Kitty, blushing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Remember me to him, be sure you do.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sure to!&rdquo; Kitty said naïvely, looking
        compassionately into her eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So good-bye, Dolly.&rdquo; And kissing Dolly and shaking hands
        with Kitty, Anna went out hurriedly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just the same and just as charming! She&rsquo;s very
        lovely!&rdquo; said Kitty, when she was alone with her sister.
        &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s something piteous about her. Awfully
        piteous!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s something unusual about her today,&rdquo; said
        Dolly. &ldquo;When I went with her into the hall, I fancied she was
        almost crying.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 29</h3>

      <p>
        Anna got into the carriage again in an even worse frame of mind than
        when she set out from home. To her previous tortures was added now that
        sense of mortification and of being an outcast which she had felt so
        distinctly on meeting Kitty.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where to? Home?&rdquo; asked Pyotr.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, home,&rdquo; she said, not even thinking now where she was
        going.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How they looked at me as something dreadful, incomprehensible,
        and curious! What can he be telling the other with such warmth?&rdquo;
        she thought, staring at two men who walked by. &ldquo;Can one ever tell
        anyone what one is feeling? I meant to tell Dolly, and it&rsquo;s a good
        thing I didn&rsquo;t tell her. How pleased she would have been at my
        misery! She would have concealed it, but her chief feeling would have
        been delight at my being punished for the happiness she envied me for.
        Kitty, she would have been even more pleased. How I can see through her!
        She knows I was more than usually sweet to her husband. And she&rsquo;s
        jealous and hates me. And she despises me. In her eyes I&rsquo;m an
        immoral woman. If I were an immoral woman I could have made her husband
        fall in love with me ... if I&rsquo;d cared to. And, indeed, I did care
        to. There&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s pleased with himself,&rdquo; she
        thought, as she saw a fat, rubicund gentleman coming towards her. He
        took her for an acquaintance, and lifted his glossy hat above his bald,
        glossy head, and then perceived his mistake. &ldquo;He thought he knew
        me. Well, he knows me as well as anyone in the world knows me. I
        don&rsquo;t know myself. I know my appetites, as the French say. They
        want that dirty ice cream, that they do know for certain,&rdquo; she
        thought, looking at two boys stopping an ice cream seller, who took a
        barrel off his head and began wiping his perspiring face with a towel.
        &ldquo;We all want what is sweet and nice. If not sweetmeats, then a
        dirty ice. And Kitty&rsquo;s the same&mdash;if not Vronsky, then Levin.
        And she envies me, and hates me. And we all hate each other. I Kitty,
        Kitty me. Yes, that&rsquo;s the truth. &lsquo;<i>Tiutkin, coiffeur.</i
        >&rsquo; <i>Je me fais coiffer par Tiutkin....</i> I&rsquo;ll tell him
        that when he comes,&rdquo; she thought and smiled. But the same instant
        she remembered that she had no one now to tell anything amusing to.
        &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s nothing amusing, nothing mirthful, really.
        It&rsquo;s all hateful. They&rsquo;re singing for vespers, and how
        carefully that merchant crosses himself! as if he were afraid of missing
        something. Why these churches and this singing and this humbug? Simply
        to conceal that we all hate each other like these cab drivers who are
        abusing each other so angrily. Yashvin says, &lsquo;He wants to strip me
        of my shirt, and I him of his.&rsquo; Yes, that&rsquo;s the
        truth!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She was plunged in these thoughts, which so engrossed her that she left
        off thinking of her own position, when the carriage drew up at the steps
        of her house. It was only when she saw the porter running out to meet
        her that she remembered she had sent the note and the telegram.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Is there an answer?&rdquo; she inquired.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see this minute,&rdquo; answered the porter, and
        glancing into his room, he took out and gave her the thin square
        envelope of a telegram. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t come before ten
        o&rsquo;clock.&mdash;Vronsky,&rdquo; she read.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And hasn&rsquo;t the messenger come back?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the porter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then, since it&rsquo;s so, I know what I must do,&rdquo; she
        said, and feeling a vague fury and craving for revenge rising up within
        her, she ran upstairs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to him myself. Before going
        away forever, I&rsquo;ll tell him all. Never have I hated anyone as I
        hate that man!&rdquo; she thought. Seeing his hat on the rack, she
        shuddered with aversion. She did not consider that his telegram was an
        answer to her telegram and that he had not yet received her note. She
        pictured him to herself as talking calmly to his mother and Princess
        Sorokina and rejoicing at her sufferings. &ldquo;Yes, I must go
        quickly,&rdquo; she said, not knowing yet where she was going. She
        longed to get away as quickly as possible from the feelings she had gone
        through in that awful house. The servants, the walls, the things in that
        house&mdash;all aroused repulsion and hatred in her and lay like a
        weight upon her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I must go to the railway station, and if he&rsquo;s not
        there, then go there and catch him.&rdquo; Anna looked at the railway
        timetable in the newspapers. An evening train went at two minutes past
        eight. &ldquo;Yes, I shall be in time.&rdquo; She gave orders for the
        other horses to be put in the carriage, and packed in a traveling-bag
        the things needed for a few days. She knew she would never come back
        here again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Among the plans that came into her head she vaguely determined that
        after what would happen at the station or at the countess&rsquo;s house,
        she would go as far as the first town on the Nizhni road and stop there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dinner was on the table; she went up, but the smell of the bread and
        cheese was enough to make her feel that all food was disgusting. She
        ordered the carriage and went out. The house threw a shadow now right
        across the street, but it was a bright evening and still warm in the
        sunshine. Annushka, who came down with her things, and Pyotr, who put
        the things in the carriage, and the coachman, evidently out of humor,
        were all hateful to her, and irritated her by their words and actions.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you, Pyotr.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But how about the ticket?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, as you like, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; she said
        crossly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pyotr jumped on the box, and putting his arms akimbo, told the coachman
        to drive to the booking-office.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 30</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here it is again! Again I understand it all!&rdquo; Anna said to
        herself, as soon as the carriage had started and swaying lightly,
        rumbled over the tiny cobbles of the paved road, and again one
        impression followed rapidly upon another.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; what was the last thing I thought of so clearly?&rdquo; she
        tried to recall it. &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Tiutkin, coiffeur?</i
        >&rsquo;&mdash;no, not that. Yes, of what Yashvin says, the struggle for
        existence and hatred is the one thing that holds men together. No,
        it&rsquo;s a useless journey you&rsquo;re making,&rdquo; she said,
        mentally addressing a party in a coach and four, evidently going for an
        excursion into the country. &ldquo;And the dog you&rsquo;re taking with
        you will be no help to you. You can&rsquo;t get away from
        yourselves.&rdquo; Turning her eyes in the direction Pyotr had turned to
        look, she saw a factory-hand almost dead-drunk, with hanging head, being
        led away by a policeman. &ldquo;Come, he&rsquo;s found a quicker
        way,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Count Vronsky and I did not find that
        happiness either, though we expected so much from it.&rdquo; And now for
        the first time Anna turned that glaring light in which she was seeing
        everything on to her relations with him, which she had hitherto avoided
        thinking about. &ldquo;What was it he sought in me? Not love so much as
        the satisfaction of vanity.&rdquo; She remembered his words, the
        expression of his face, that recalled an abject setter-dog, in the early
        days of their connection. And everything now confirmed this. &ldquo;Yes,
        there was the triumph of success in him. Of course there was love too,
        but the chief element was the pride of success. He boasted of me. Now
        that&rsquo;s over. There&rsquo;s nothing to be proud of. Not to be proud
        of, but to be ashamed of. He has taken from me all he could, and now I
        am no use to him. He is weary of me and is trying not to be dishonorable
        in his behavior to me. He let that out yesterday&mdash;he wants divorce
        and marriage so as to burn his ships. He loves me, but how? The zest is
        gone, as the English say. That fellow wants everyone to admire him and
        is very much pleased with himself,&rdquo; she thought, looking at a
        red-faced clerk, riding on a riding-school horse. &ldquo;Yes,
        there&rsquo;s not the same flavor about me for him now. If I go away
        from him, at the bottom of his heart he will be glad.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This was not mere supposition, she saw it distinctly in the piercing
        light, which revealed to her now the meaning of life and human
        relations.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My love keeps growing more passionate and egoistic, while his is
        waning and waning, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re drifting
        apart.&rdquo; She went on musing. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no help for
        it. He is everything for me, and I want him more and more to give
        himself up to me entirely. And he wants more and more to get away from
        me. We walked to meet each other up to the time of our love, and then we
        have been irresistibly drifting in different directions. And
        there&rsquo;s no altering that. He tells me I&rsquo;m insanely jealous,
        and I have told myself that I am insanely jealous; but it&rsquo;s not
        true. I&rsquo;m not jealous, but I&rsquo;m unsatisfied. But....&rdquo;
        she opened her lips, and shifted her place in the carriage in the
        excitement, aroused by the thought that suddenly struck her. &ldquo;If I
        could be anything but a mistress, passionately caring for nothing but
        his caresses; but I can&rsquo;t and I don&rsquo;t care to be anything
        else. And by that desire I rouse aversion in him, and he rouses fury in
        me, and it cannot be different. Don&rsquo;t I know that he
        wouldn&rsquo;t deceive me, that he has no schemes about Princess
        Sorokina, that he&rsquo;s not in love with Kitty, that he won&rsquo;t
        desert me! I know all that, but it makes it no better for me. If without
        loving me, from <i>duty</i> he&rsquo;ll be good and kind to me, without
        what I want, that&rsquo;s a thousand times worse than unkindness!
        That&rsquo;s&mdash;hell! And that&rsquo;s just how it is. For a long
        while now he hasn&rsquo;t loved me. And where love ends, hate begins. I
        don&rsquo;t know these streets at all. Hills it seems, and still houses,
        and houses.... And in the houses always people and people.... How many
        of them, no end, and all hating each other! Come, let me try and think
        what I want, to make me happy. Well? Suppose I am divorced, and Alexey
        Alexandrovitch lets me have Seryozha, and I marry Vronsky.&rdquo;
        Thinking of Alexey Alexandrovitch, she at once pictured him with
        extraordinary vividness as though he were alive before her, with his
        mild, lifeless, dull eyes, the blue veins in his white hands, his
        intonations and the cracking of his fingers, and remembering the feeling
        which had existed between them, and which was also called love, she
        shuddered with loathing. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m divorced, and become
        Vronsky&rsquo;s wife. Well, will Kitty cease looking at me as she looked
        at me today? No. And will Seryozha leave off asking and wondering about
        my two husbands? And is there any new feeling I can awaken between
        Vronsky and me? Is there possible, if not happiness, some sort of ease
        from misery? No, no!&rdquo; she answered now without the slightest
        hesitation. &ldquo;Impossible! We are drawn apart by life, and I make
        his unhappiness, and he mine, and there&rsquo;s no altering him or me.
        Every attempt has been made, the screw has come unscrewed. Oh, a beggar
        woman with a baby. She thinks I&rsquo;m sorry for her. Aren&rsquo;t we
        all flung into the world only to hate each other, and so to torture
        ourselves and each other? Schoolboys coming&mdash;laughing
        Seryozha?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I thought, too, that I loved him,
        and used to be touched by my own tenderness. But I have lived without
        him, I gave him up for another love, and did not regret the exchange
        till that love was satisfied.&rdquo; And with loathing she thought of
        what she meant by that love. And the clearness with which she saw life
        now, her own and all men&rsquo;s, was a pleasure to her.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so with me and Pyotr, and the coachman, Fyodor, and
        that merchant, and all the people living along the Volga, where those
        placards invite one to go, and everywhere and always,&rdquo; she thought
        when she had driven under the low-pitched roof of the Nizhigorod
        station, and the porters ran to meet her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A ticket to Obiralovka?&rdquo; said Pyotr.
      </p>

      <p>
        She had utterly forgotten where and why she was going, and only by a
        great effort she understood the question.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, handing him her purse, and taking a little
        red bag in her hand, she got out of the carriage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Making her way through the crowd to the first-class waiting-room, she
        gradually recollected all the details of her position, and the plans
        between which she was hesitating. And again at the old sore places, hope
        and then despair poisoned the wounds of her tortured, fearfully
        throbbing heart. As she sat on the star-shaped sofa waiting for the
        train, she gazed with aversion at the people coming and going (they were
        all hateful to her), and thought how she would arrive at the station,
        would write him a note, and what she would write to him, and how he was
        at this moment complaining to his mother of his position, not
        understanding her sufferings, and how she would go into the room, and
        what she would say to him. Then she thought that life might still be
        happy, and how miserably she loved and hated him, and how fearfully her
        heart was beating.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 31</h3>

      <p>
        A bell rang, some young men, ugly and impudent, and at the same time
        careful of the impression they were making, hurried by. Pyotr, too,
        crossed the room in his livery and top-boots, with his dull, animal
        face, and came up to her to take her to the train. Some noisy men were
        quiet as she passed them on the platform, and one whispered something
        about her to another&mdash;something vile, no doubt. She stepped up on
        the high step, and sat down in a carriage by herself on a dirty seat
        that had been white. Her bag lay beside her, shaken up and down by the
        springiness of the seat. With a foolish smile Pyotr raised his hat, with
        its colored band, at the window, in token of farewell; an impudent
        conductor slammed the door and the latch. A grotesque-looking lady
        wearing a bustle (Anna mentally undressed the woman, and was appalled at
        her hideousness), and a little girl laughing affectedly ran down the
        platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Katerina Andreevna, she&rsquo;s got them all,
        <i>ma tante!</i>&rdquo; cried the girl.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Even the child&rsquo;s hideous and affected,&rdquo; thought Anna.
        To avoid seeing anyone, she got up quickly and seated herself at the
        opposite window of the empty carriage. A misshapen-looking peasant
        covered with dirt, in a cap from which his tangled hair stuck out all
        round, passed by that window, stooping down to the carriage wheels.
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something familiar about that hideous
        peasant,&rdquo; thought Anna. And remembering her dream, she moved away
        to the opposite door, shaking with terror. The conductor opened the door
        and let in a man and his wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you wish to get out?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna made no answer. The conductor and her two fellow-passengers did not
        notice under her veil her panic-stricken face. She went back to her
        corner and sat down. The couple seated themselves on the opposite side,
        and intently but surreptitiously scrutinized her clothes. Both husband
        and wife seemed repulsive to Anna. The husband asked, would she allow
        him to smoke, obviously not with a view to smoking but to getting into
        conversation with her. Receiving her assent, he said to his wife in
        French something about caring less to smoke than to talk. They made
        inane and affected remarks to one another, entirely for her benefit.
        Anna saw clearly that they were sick of each other, and hated each
        other. And no one could have helped hating such miserable monstrosities.
      </p>

      <p>
        A second bell sounded, and was followed by moving of luggage, noise,
        shouting and laughter. It was so clear to Anna that there was nothing
        for anyone to be glad of, that this laughter irritated her agonizingly,
        and she would have liked to stop up her ears not to hear it. At last the
        third bell rang, there was a whistle and a hiss of steam, and a clank of
        chains, and the man in her carriage crossed himself. &ldquo;It would be
        interesting to ask him what meaning he attaches to that,&rdquo; thought
        Anna, looking angrily at him. She looked past the lady out of the window
        at the people who seemed whirling by as they ran beside the train or
        stood on the platform. The train, jerking at regular intervals at the
        junctions of the rails, rolled by the platform, past a stone wall, a
        signal-box, past other trains; the wheels, moving more smoothly and
        evenly, resounded with a slight clang on the rails. The window was
        lighted up by the bright evening sun, and a slight breeze fluttered the
        curtain. Anna forgot her fellow passengers, and to the light swaying of
        the train she fell to thinking again, as she breathed the fresh air.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, what did I stop at? That I couldn&rsquo;t conceive a
        position in which life would not be a misery, that we are all created to
        be miserable, and that we all know it, and all invent means of deceiving
        each other. And when one sees the truth, what is one to do?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what reason is given man for, to escape from what
        worries him,&rdquo; said the lady in French, lisping affectedly, and
        obviously pleased with her phrase.
      </p>

      <p>
        The words seemed an answer to Anna&rsquo;s thoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To escape from what worries him,&rdquo; repeated Anna. And
        glancing at the red-cheeked husband and the thin wife, she saw that the
        sickly wife considered herself misunderstood, and the husband deceived
        her and encouraged her in that idea of herself. Anna seemed to see all
        their history and all the crannies of their souls, as it were turning a
        light upon them. But there was nothing interesting in them, and she
        pursued her thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m very much worried, and that&rsquo;s what reason
        was given me for, to escape; so then one must escape: why not put out
        the light when there&rsquo;s nothing more to look at, when it&rsquo;s
        sickening to look at it all? But how? Why did the conductor run along
        the footboard, why are they shrieking, those young men in that train?
        why are they talking, why are they laughing? It&rsquo;s all falsehood,
        all lying, all humbug, all cruelty!...&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        When the train came into the station, Anna got out into the crowd of
        passengers, and moving apart from them as if they were lepers, she stood
        on the platform, trying to think what she had come here for, and what
        she meant to do. Everything that had seemed to her possible before was
        now so difficult to consider, especially in this noisy crowd of hideous
        people who would not leave her alone. One moment porters ran up to her
        proffering their services, then young men, clacking their heels on the
        planks of the platform and talking loudly, stared at her; people meeting
        her dodged past on the wrong side. Remembering that she had meant to go
        on further if there were no answer, she stopped a porter and asked if
        her coachman were not here with a note from Count Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Count Vronsky? They sent up here from the Vronskys just this
        minute, to meet Princess Sorokina and her daughter. And what is the
        coachman like?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as she was talking to the porter, the coachman Mihail, red and
        cheerful in his smart blue coat and chain, evidently proud of having so
        successfully performed his commission, came up to her and gave her a
        letter. She broke it open, and her heart ached before she had read it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very sorry your note did not reach me. I will be home at
        ten,&rdquo; Vronsky had written carelessly....
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I expected!&rdquo; she said to herself
        with an evil smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very good, you can go home then,&rdquo; she said softly,
        addressing Mihail. She spoke softly because the rapidity of her
        heart&rsquo;s beating hindered her breathing. &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t
        let you make me miserable,&rdquo; she thought menacingly, addressing not
        him, not herself, but the power that made her suffer, and she walked
        along the platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two maid-servants walking along the platform turned their heads, staring
        at her and making some remarks about her dress. &ldquo;Real,&rdquo; they
        said of the lace she was wearing. The young men would not leave her in
        peace. Again they passed by, peering into her face, and with a laugh
        shouting something in an unnatural voice. The station-master coming up
        asked her whether she was going by train. A boy selling kvas never took
        his eyes off her. &ldquo;My God! where am I to go?&rdquo; she thought,
        going farther and farther along the platform. At the end she stopped.
        Some ladies and children, who had come to meet a gentleman in
        spectacles, paused in their loud laughter and talking, and stared at her
        as she reached them. She quickened her pace and walked away from them to
        the edge of the platform. A luggage train was coming in. The platform
        began to sway, and she fancied she was in the train again.
      </p>

      <p>
        And all at once she thought of the man crushed by the train the day she
        had first met Vronsky, and she knew what she had to do. With a rapid,
        light step she went down the steps that led from the tank to the rails
        and stopped quite near the approaching train.
      </p>

      <p>
        She looked at the lower part of the carriages, at the screws and chains
        and the tall cast-iron wheel of the first carriage slowly moving up, and
        trying to measure the middle between the front and back wheels, and the
        very minute when that middle point would be opposite her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said to herself, looking into the shadow of the
        carriage, at the sand and coal dust which covered the
        sleepers&mdash;&ldquo;there, in the very middle, and I will punish him
        and escape from everyone and from myself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first carriage as it
        reached her; but the red bag which she tried to drop out of her hand
        delayed her, and she was too late; she missed the moment. She had to
        wait for the next carriage. A feeling such as she had known when about
        to take the first plunge in bathing came upon her, and she crossed
        herself. That familiar gesture brought back into her soul a whole series
        of girlish and childish memories, and suddenly the darkness that had
        covered everything for her was torn apart, and life rose up before her
        for an instant with all its bright past joys. But she did not take her
        eyes from the wheels of the second carriage. And exactly at the moment
        when the space between the wheels came opposite her, she dropped the red
        bag, and drawing her head back into her shoulders, fell on her hands
        under the carriage, and lightly, as though she would rise again at once,
        dropped on to her knees. And at the same instant she was terror-stricken
        at what she was doing. &ldquo;Where am I? What am I doing? What
        for?&rdquo; She tried to get up, to drop backwards; but something huge
        and merciless struck her on the head and rolled her on her back.
        &ldquo;Lord, forgive me all!&rdquo; she said, feeling it impossible to
        struggle. A peasant muttering something was working at the iron above
        her. And the light by which she had read the book filled with troubles,
        falsehoods, sorrow, and evil, flared up more brightly than ever before,
        lighted up for her all that had been in darkness, flickered, began to
        grow dim, and was quenched forever.

      <h2>PART EIGHT</h2>

      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>

      <p>
        Almost two months had passed. The hot summer was half over, but Sergey
        Ivanovitch was only just preparing to leave Moscow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s life had not been uneventful during this time.
        A year ago he had finished his book, the fruit of six years&rsquo;
        labor, &ldquo;Sketch of a Survey of the Principles and Forms of
        Government in Europe and Russia.&rdquo; Several sections of this book
        and its introduction had appeared in periodical publications, and other
        parts had been read by Sergey Ivanovitch to persons of his circle, so
        that the leading ideas of the work could not be completely novel to the
        public. But still Sergey Ivanovitch had expected that on its appearance
        his book would be sure to make a serious impression on society, and if
        it did not cause a revolution in social science it would, at any rate,
        make a great stir in the scientific world.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the most conscientious revision the book had last year been
        published, and had been distributed among the booksellers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though he asked no one about it, reluctantly and with feigned
        indifference answered his friends&rsquo; inquiries as to how the book
        was going, and did not even inquire of the booksellers how the book was
        selling, Sergey Ivanovitch was all on the alert, with strained
        attention, watching for the first impression his book would make in the
        world and in literature.
      </p>

      <p>
        But a week passed, a second, a third, and in society no impression
        whatever could be detected. His friends who were specialists and
        savants, occasionally&mdash;unmistakably from politeness&mdash;alluded
        to it. The rest of his acquaintances, not interested in a book on a
        learned subject, did not talk of it at all. And society
        generally&mdash;just now especially absorbed in other things&mdash;was
        absolutely indifferent. In the press, too, for a whole month there was
        not a word about his book.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch had calculated to a nicety the time necessary for
        writing a review, but a month passed, and a second, and still there was
        silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only in the <i>Northern Beetle</i>, in a comic article on the singer
        Drabanti, who had lost his voice, there was a contemptuous allusion to
        Koznishev&rsquo;s book, suggesting that the book had been long ago seen
        through by everyone, and was a subject of general ridicule.
      </p>

      <p>
        At last in the third month a critical article appeared in a serious
        review. Sergey Ivanovitch knew the author of the article. He had met him
        once at Golubtsov&rsquo;s.
      </p>

      <p>
        The author of the article was a young man, an invalid, very bold as a
        writer, but extremely deficient in breeding and shy in personal
        relations.
      </p>

      <p>
        In spite of his absolute contempt for the author, it was with complete
        respect that Sergey Ivanovitch set about reading the article. The
        article was awful.
      </p>

      <p>
        The critic had undoubtedly put an interpretation upon the book which
        could not possibly be put on it. But he had selected quotations so
        adroitly that for people who had not read the book (and obviously
        scarcely anyone had read it) it seemed absolutely clear that the whole
        book was nothing but a medley of high-flown phrases, not even&mdash;as
        suggested by marks of interrogation&mdash;used appropriately, and that
        the author of the book was a person absolutely without knowledge of the
        subject. And all this was so wittily done that Sergey Ivanovitch would
        not have disowned such wit himself. But that was just what was so awful.
      </p>

      <p>
        In spite of the scrupulous conscientiousness with which Sergey
        Ivanovitch verified the correctness of the critic&rsquo;s arguments, he
        did not for a minute stop to ponder over the faults and mistakes which
        were ridiculed; but unconsciously he began immediately trying to recall
        every detail of his meeting and conversation with the author of the
        article.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I offend him in some way?&rdquo; Sergey Ivanovitch
        wondered.
      </p>

      <p>
        And remembering that when they met he had corrected the young man about
        something he had said that betrayed ignorance, Sergey Ivanovitch found
        the clue to explain the article.
      </p>

      <p>
        This article was followed by a deadly silence about the book both in the
        press and in conversation, and Sergey Ivanovitch saw that his six
        years&rsquo; task, toiled at with such love and labor, had gone, leaving
        no trace.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s position was still more difficult from the
        fact that, since he had finished his book, he had had no more literary
        work to do, such as had hitherto occupied the greater part of his time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch was clever, cultivated, healthy, and energetic, and he
        did not know what use to make of his energy. Conversations in
        drawing-rooms, in meetings, assemblies, and committees&mdash;everywhere
        where talk was possible&mdash;took up part of his time. But being used
        for years to town life, he did not waste all his energies in talk, as
        his less experienced younger brother did, when he was in Moscow. He had
        a great deal of leisure and intellectual energy still to dispose of.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately for him, at this period so difficult for him from the
        failure of his book, the various public questions of the dissenting
        sects, of the American alliance, of the Samara famine, of exhibitions,
        and of spiritualism, were definitely replaced in public interest by the
        Slavonic question, which had hitherto rather languidly interested
        society, and Sergey Ivanovitch, who had been one of the first to raise
        this subject, threw himself into it heart and soul.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the circle to which Sergey Ivanovitch belonged, nothing was talked of
        or written about just now but the Servian War. Everything that the idle
        crowd usually does to kill time was done now for the benefit of the
        Slavonic States. Balls, concerts, dinners, matchboxes, ladies&rsquo;
        dresses, beer, restaurants&mdash;everything testified to sympathy with
        the Slavonic peoples.
      </p>

      <p>
        From much of what was spoken and written on the subject, Sergey
        Ivanovitch differed on various points. He saw that the Slavonic question
        had become one of those fashionable distractions which succeed one
        another in providing society with an object and an occupation. He saw,
        too, that a great many people were taking up the subject from motives of
        self-interest and self-advertisement. He recognized that the newspapers
        published a great deal that was superfluous and exaggerated, with the
        sole aim of attracting attention and outbidding one another. He saw that
        in this general movement those who thrust themselves most forward and
        shouted the loudest were men who had failed and were smarting under a
        sense of injury&mdash;generals without armies, ministers not in the
        ministry, journalists not on any paper, party leaders without followers.
        He saw that there was a great deal in it that was frivolous and absurd.
        But he saw and recognized an unmistakable growing enthusiasm, uniting
        all classes, with which it was impossible not to sympathize. The
        massacre of men who were fellow Christians, and of the same Slavonic
        race, excited sympathy for the sufferers and indignation against the
        oppressors. And the heroism of the Servians and Montenegrins struggling
        for a great cause begot in the whole people a longing to help their
        brothers not in word but in deed.
      </p>

      <p>
        But in this there was another aspect that rejoiced Sergey Ivanovitch.
        That was the manifestation of public opinion. The public had definitely
        expressed its desire. The soul of the people had, as Sergey Ivanovitch
        said, found expression. And the more he worked in this cause, the more
        incontestable it seemed to him that it was a cause destined to assume
        vast dimensions, to create an epoch.
      </p>

      <p>
        He threw himself heart and soul into the service of this great cause,
        and forgot to think about his book. His whole time now was engrossed by
        it, so that he could scarcely manage to answer all the letters and
        appeals addressed to him. He worked the whole spring and part of the
        summer, and it was only in July that he prepared to go away to his
        brother&rsquo;s in the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was going both to rest for a fortnight, and in the very heart of the
        people, in the farthest wilds of the country, to enjoy the sight of that
        uplifting of the spirit of the people, of which, like all residents in
        the capital and big towns, he was fully persuaded. Katavasov had long
        been meaning to carry out his promise to stay with Levin, and so he was
        going with him.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had only just reached the station of the
        Kursk line, which was particularly busy and full of people that day,
        when, looking round for the groom who was following with their things,
        they saw a party of volunteers driving up in four cabs. Ladies met them
        with bouquets of flowers, and followed by the rushing crowd they went
        into the station.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the ladies, who had met the volunteers, came out of the hall and
        addressed Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You too come to see them off?&rdquo; she asked in French.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going away myself, princess. To my brother&rsquo;s
        for a holiday. Do you always see them off?&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch
        with a hardly perceptible smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, that would be impossible!&rdquo; answered the princess.
        &ldquo;Is it true that eight hundred have been sent from us already?
        Malvinsky wouldn&rsquo;t believe me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;More than eight hundred. If you reckon those who have been sent
        not directly from Moscow, over a thousand,&rdquo; answered Sergey
        Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There! That&rsquo;s just what I said!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady.
        &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s true too, I suppose, that more than a million has
        been subscribed?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, princess.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you say to today&rsquo;s telegram? Beaten the Turks
        again.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, so I saw,&rdquo; answered Sergey Ivanovitch. They were
        speaking of the last telegram stating that the Turks had been for three
        days in succession beaten at all points and put to flight, and that
        tomorrow a decisive engagement was expected.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, by the way, a splendid young fellow has asked leave to go,
        and they&rsquo;ve made some difficulty, I don&rsquo;t know why. I meant
        to ask you; I know him; please write a note about his case. He&rsquo;s
        being sent by Countess Lidia Ivanovna.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch asked for all the details the princess knew about the
        young man, and going into the first-class waiting-room, wrote a note to
        the person on whom the granting of leave of absence depended, and handed
        it to the princess.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You know Count Vronsky, the notorious one ... is going by this
        train?&rdquo; said the princess with a smile full of triumph and
        meaning, when he found her again and gave her the letter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I had heard he was going, but I did not know when. By this
        train?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him. He&rsquo;s here: there&rsquo;s only his
        mother seeing him off. It&rsquo;s the best thing, anyway, that he could
        do.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, of course.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        While they were talking the crowd streamed by them into the dining-room.
        They went forward too, and heard a gentleman with a glass in his hand
        delivering a loud discourse to the volunteers. &ldquo;In the service of
        religion, humanity, and our brothers,&rdquo; the gentleman said, his
        voice growing louder and louder; &ldquo;to this great cause mother
        Moscow dedicates you with her blessing. <i>Jivio!</i>&rdquo; he
        concluded, loudly and tearfully.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone shouted <i>Jivio!</i> and a fresh crowd dashed into the hall,
        almost carrying the princess off her legs.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, princess! that was something like!&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, suddenly appearing in the middle of the crowd and beaming
        upon them with a delighted smile. &ldquo;Capitally, warmly said,
        wasn&rsquo;t it? Bravo! And Sergey Ivanovitch! Why, you ought to have
        said something&mdash;just a few words, you know, to encourage them; you
        do that so well,&rdquo; he added with a soft, respectful, and discreet
        smile, moving Sergey Ivanovitch forward a little by the arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m just off.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To the country, to my brother&rsquo;s,&rdquo; answered Sergey
        Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll see my wife. I&rsquo;ve written to her, but
        you&rsquo;ll see her first. Please tell her that they&rsquo;ve seen me
        and that it&rsquo;s &lsquo;all right,&rsquo; as the English say.
        She&rsquo;ll understand. Oh, and be so good as to tell her I&rsquo;m
        appointed secretary of the committee.... But she&rsquo;ll understand!
        You know, <i>les petites misères de la vie humaine,</i>&rdquo; he said,
        as it were apologizing to the princess. &ldquo;And Princess
        Myakaya&mdash;not Liza, but Bibish&mdash;is sending a thousand guns and
        twelve nurses. Did I tell you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I heard so,&rdquo; answered Koznishev indifferently.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you&rsquo;re going away,&rdquo; said Stepan
        Arkadyevitch. &ldquo;Tomorrow we&rsquo;re giving a dinner to two
        who&rsquo;re setting off&mdash;Dimer-Bartnyansky from Petersburg and our
        Veslovsky, Grisha. They&rsquo;re both going. Veslovsky&rsquo;s only
        lately married. There&rsquo;s a fine fellow for you! Eh,
        princess?&rdquo; he turned to the lady.
      </p>

      <p>
        The princess looked at Koznishev without replying. But the fact that
        Sergey Ivanovitch and the princess seemed anxious to get rid of him did
        not in the least disconcert Stepan Arkadyevitch. Smiling, he stared at
        the feather in the princess&rsquo;s hat, and then about him as though he
        were going to pick something up. Seeing a lady approaching with a
        collecting box, he beckoned her up and put in a five-rouble note.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can never see these collecting boxes unmoved while I&rsquo;ve
        money in my pocket,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And how about today&rsquo;s
        telegram? Fine chaps those Montenegrins!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; he cried, when the princess told
        him that Vronsky was going by this train. For an instant Stepan
        Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s face looked sad, but a minute later, when, stroking
        his mustaches and swinging as he walked, he went into the hall where
        Vronsky was, he had completely forgotten his own despairing sobs over
        his sister&rsquo;s corpse, and he saw in Vronsky only a hero and an old
        friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;With all his faults one can&rsquo;t refuse to do him
        justice,&rdquo; said the princess to Sergey Ivanovitch as soon as Stepan
        Arkadyevitch had left them. &ldquo;What a typically Russian, Slav
        nature! Only, I&rsquo;m afraid it won&rsquo;t be pleasant for Vronsky to
        see him. Say what you will, I&rsquo;m touched by that man&rsquo;s fate.
        Do talk to him a little on the way,&rdquo; said the princess.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, perhaps, if it happens so.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I never liked him. But this atones for a great deal. He&rsquo;s
        not merely going himself, he&rsquo;s taking a squadron at his own
        expense.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, so I heard.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        A bell sounded. Everyone crowded to the doors. &ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo;
        said the princess, indicating Vronsky, who with his mother on his arm
        walked by, wearing a long overcoat and wide-brimmed black hat. Oblonsky
        was walking beside him, talking eagerly of something.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky was frowning and looking straight before him, as though he did
        not hear what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying.
      </p>

      <p>
        Probably on Oblonsky&rsquo;s pointing them out, he looked round in the
        direction where the princess and Sergey Ivanovitch were standing, and
        without speaking lifted his hat. His face, aged and worn by suffering,
        looked stony.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going onto the platform, Vronsky left his mother and disappeared into a
        compartment.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the platform there rang out &ldquo;God save the Tsar,&rdquo; then
        shouts of &ldquo;hurrah!&rdquo; and <i>&ldquo;jivio!&rdquo;</i> One of
        the volunteers, a tall, very young man with a hollow chest, was
        particularly conspicuous, bowing and waving his felt hat and a nosegay
        over his head. Then two officers emerged, bowing too, and a stout man
        with a big beard, wearing a greasy forage cap.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 3</h3>

      <p>
        Saying good-bye to the princess, Sergey Ivanovitch was joined by
        Katavasov; together they got into a carriage full to overflowing, and
        the train started.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Tsaritsino station the train was met by a chorus of young men singing
        &ldquo;Hail to Thee!&rdquo; Again the volunteers bowed and poked their
        heads out, but Sergey Ivanovitch paid no attention to them. He had had
        so much to do with the volunteers that the type was familiar to him and
        did not interest him. Katavasov, whose scientific work had prevented his
        having a chance of observing them hitherto, was very much interested in
        them and questioned Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch advised him to go into the second-class and talk to
        them himself. At the next station Katavasov acted on this suggestion.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the first stop he moved into the second-class and made the
        acquaintance of the volunteers. They were sitting in a corner of the
        carriage, talking loudly and obviously aware that the attention of the
        passengers and Katavasov as he got in was concentrated upon them. More
        loudly than all talked the tall, hollow-chested young man. He was
        unmistakably tipsy, and was relating some story that had occurred at his
        school. Facing him sat a middle-aged officer in the Austrian military
        jacket of the Guards uniform. He was listening with a smile to the
        hollow-chested youth, and occasionally pulling him up. The third, in an
        artillery uniform, was sitting on a box beside them. A fourth was
        asleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        Entering into conversation with the youth, Katavasov learned that he was
        a wealthy Moscow merchant who had run through a large fortune before he
        was two-and-twenty. Katavasov did not like him, because he was unmanly
        and effeminate and sickly. He was obviously convinced, especially now
        after drinking, that he was performing a heroic action, and he bragged
        of it in the most unpleasant way.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second, the retired officer, made an unpleasant impression too upon
        Katavasov. He was, it seemed, a man who had tried everything. He had
        been on a railway, had been a land-steward, and had started factories,
        and he talked, quite without necessity, of all he had done, and used
        learned expressions quite inappropriately.
      </p>

      <p>
        The third, the artilleryman, on the contrary, struck Katavasov very
        favorably. He was a quiet, modest fellow, unmistakably impressed by the
        knowledge of the officer and the heroic self-sacrifice of the merchant
        and saying nothing about himself. When Katavasov asked him what had
        impelled him to go to Servia, he answered modestly:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, everyone&rsquo;s going. The Servians want help, too.
        I&rsquo;m sorry for them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you artillerymen especially are scarce there,&rdquo; said
        Katavasov.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t long in the artillery, maybe they&rsquo;ll put
        me into the infantry or the cavalry.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Into the infantry when they need artillery more than
        anything?&rdquo; said Katavasov, fancying from the artilleryman&rsquo;s
        apparent age that he must have reached a fairly high grade.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t long in the artillery; I&rsquo;m a cadet
        retired,&rdquo; he said, and he began to explain how he had failed in
        his examination.
      </p>

      <p>
        All of this together made a disagreeable impression on Katavasov, and
        when the volunteers got out at a station for a drink, Katavasov would
        have liked to compare his unfavorable impression in conversation with
        someone. There was an old man in the carriage, wearing a military
        overcoat, who had been listening all the while to Katavasov&rsquo;s
        conversation with the volunteers. When they were left alone, Katavasov
        addressed him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What different positions they come from, all those fellows who
        are going off there,&rdquo; Katavasov said vaguely, not wishing to
        express his own opinion, and at the same time anxious to find out the
        old man&rsquo;s views.
      </p>

      <p>
        The old man was an officer who had served on two campaigns. He knew what
        makes a soldier, and judging by the appearance and the talk of those
        persons, by the swagger with which they had recourse to the bottle on
        the journey, he considered them poor soldiers. Moreover, he lived in a
        district town, and he was longing to tell how one soldier had
        volunteered from his town, a drunkard and a thief whom no one would
        employ as a laborer. But knowing by experience that in the present
        condition of the public temper it was dangerous to express an opinion
        opposed to the general one, and especially to criticize the volunteers
        unfavorably, he too watched Katavasov without committing himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, men are wanted there,&rdquo; he said, laughing with his
        eyes. And they fell to talking of the last war news, and each concealed
        from the other his perplexity as to the engagement expected next day,
        since the Turks had been beaten, according to the latest news, at all
        points. And so they parted, neither giving expression to his opinion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Katavasov went back to his own carriage, and with reluctant hypocrisy
        reported to Sergey Ivanovitch his observations of the volunteers, from
        which it would appear that they were capital fellows.
      </p>

      <p>
        At a big station at a town the volunteers were again greeted with shouts
        and singing, again men and women with collecting boxes appeared, and
        provincial ladies brought bouquets to the volunteers and followed them
        into the refreshment room; but all this was on a much smaller and
        feebler scale than in Moscow.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 4</h3>

      <p>
        While the train was stopping at the provincial town, Sergey Ivanovitch
        did not go to the refreshment room, but walked up and down the platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first time he passed Vronsky&rsquo;s compartment he noticed that the
        curtain was drawn over the window; but as he passed it the second time
        he saw the old countess at the window. She beckoned to Koznishev.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, you see, taking him as far as Kursk,&rdquo; she
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, so I heard,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch, standing at her
        window and peeping in. &ldquo;What a noble act on his part!&rdquo; he
        added, noticing that Vronsky was not in the compartment.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, after his misfortune, what was there for him to do?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a terrible thing it was!&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, what I have been through! But do get in.... Ah, what I have
        been through!&rdquo; she repeated, when Sergey Ivanovitch had got in and
        sat down beside her. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t conceive it! For six weeks
        he did not speak to anyone, and would not touch food except when I
        implored him. And not for one minute could we leave him alone. We took
        away everything he could have used against himself. We lived on the
        ground floor, but there was no reckoning on anything. You know, of
        course, that he had shot himself once already on her account,&rdquo; she
        said, and the old lady&rsquo;s eyelashes twitched at the recollection.
        &ldquo;Yes, hers was the fitting end for such a woman. Even the death
        she chose was low and vulgar.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for us to judge, countess,&rdquo; said Sergey
        Ivanovitch; &ldquo;but I can understand that it has been very hard for
        you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t speak of it! I was staying on my estate, and he
        was with me. A note was brought him. He wrote an answer and sent it off.
        We hadn&rsquo;t an idea that she was close by at the station. In the
        evening I had only just gone to my room, when my Mary told me a lady had
        thrown herself under the train. Something seemed to strike me at once. I
        knew it was she. The first thing I said was, he was not to be told. But
        they&rsquo;d told him already. His coachman was there and saw it all.
        When I ran into his room, he was beside himself&mdash;it was fearful to
        see him. He didn&rsquo;t say a word, but galloped off there. I
        don&rsquo;t know to this day what happened there, but he was brought
        back at death&rsquo;s door. I shouldn&rsquo;t have known him.
        <i>Prostration complète,</i> the doctor said. And that was followed
        almost by madness. Oh, why talk of it!&rdquo; said the countess with a
        wave of her hand. &ldquo;It was an awful time! No, say what you will,
        she was a bad woman. Why, what is the meaning of such desperate
        passions? It was all to show herself something out of the way. Well, and
        that she did do. She brought herself to ruin and two good men&mdash;her
        husband and my unhappy son.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And what did her husband do?&rdquo; asked Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He has taken her daughter. Alexey was ready to agree to anything
        at first. Now it worries him terribly that he should have given his own
        child away to another man. But he can&rsquo;t take back his word.
        Karenin came to the funeral. But we tried to prevent his meeting Alexey.
        For him, for her husband, it was easier, anyway. She had set him free.
        But my poor son was utterly given up to her. He had thrown up
        everything, his career, me, and even then she had no mercy on him, but
        of set purpose she made his ruin complete. No, say what you will, her
        very death was the death of a vile woman, of no religious feeling. God
        forgive me, but I can&rsquo;t help hating the memory of her, when I look
        at my son&rsquo;s misery!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But how is he now?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It was a blessing from Providence for us&mdash;this Servian war.
        I&rsquo;m old, and I don&rsquo;t understand the rights and wrongs of it,
        but it&rsquo;s come as a providential blessing to him. Of course for me,
        as his mother, it&rsquo;s terrible; and what&rsquo;s worse, they say,
        <i>ce n&rsquo;est pas très bien vu à Pétersbourg</i>. But it can&rsquo;t
        be helped! It was the one thing that could rouse him. Yashvin&mdash;a
        friend of his&mdash;he had lost all he had at cards and he was going to
        Servia. He came to see him and persuaded him to go. Now it&rsquo;s an
        interest for him. Do please talk to him a little. I want to distract his
        mind. He&rsquo;s so low-spirited. And as bad luck would have it, he has
        toothache too. But he&rsquo;ll be delighted to see you. Please do talk
        to him; he&rsquo;s walking up and down on that side.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch said he would be very glad to, and crossed over to the
        other side of the station.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 5</h3>

      <p>
        In the slanting evening shadows cast by the baggage piled up on the
        platform, Vronsky in his long overcoat and slouch hat, with his hands in
        his pockets, strode up and down, like a wild beast in a cage, turning
        sharply after twenty paces. Sergey Ivanovitch fancied, as he approached
        him, that Vronsky saw him but was pretending not to see. This did not
        affect Sergey Ivanovitch in the slightest. He was above all personal
        considerations with Vronsky.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment Sergey Ivanovitch looked upon Vronsky as a man taking an
        important part in a great cause, and Koznishev thought it his duty to
        encourage him and express his approval. He went up to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vronsky stood still, looked intently at him, recognized him, and going a
        few steps forward to meet him, shook hands with him very warmly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Possibly you didn&rsquo;t wish to see me,&rdquo; said Sergey
        Ivanovitch, &ldquo;but couldn&rsquo;t I be of use to you?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one I should less dislike seeing than
        you,&rdquo; said Vronsky. &ldquo;Excuse me; and there&rsquo;s nothing in
        life for me to like.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I quite understand, and I merely meant to offer you my
        services,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch, scanning Vronsky&rsquo;s face,
        full of unmistakable suffering. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be of use to
        you to have a letter to Ristitch&mdash;to Milan?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Vronsky said, seeming to understand him with
        difficulty. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, let&rsquo;s walk on.
        It&rsquo;s so stuffy among the carriages. A letter? No, thank you; to
        meet death one needs no letters of introduction. Nor for the
        Turks....&rdquo; he said, with a smile that was merely of the lips. His
        eyes still kept their look of angry suffering.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but you might find it easier to get into relations, which
        are after all essential, with anyone prepared to see you. But
        that&rsquo;s as you like. I was very glad to hear of your intention.
        There have been so many attacks made on the volunteers, and a man like
        you raises them in public estimation.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My use as a man,&rdquo; said Vronsky, &ldquo;is that life&rsquo;s
        worth nothing to me. And that I&rsquo;ve enough bodily energy to cut my
        way into their ranks, and to trample on them or fall&mdash;I know that.
        I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s something to give my life for, for
        it&rsquo;s not simply useless but loathsome to me. Anyone&rsquo;s
        welcome to it.&rdquo; And his jaw twitched impatiently from the
        incessant gnawing toothache, that prevented him from even speaking with
        a natural expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You will become another man, I predict,&rdquo; said Sergey
        Ivanovitch, feeling touched. &ldquo;To deliver one&rsquo;s brother-men
        from bondage is an aim worth death and life. God grant you success
        outwardly&mdash;and inwardly peace,&rdquo; he added, and he held out his
        hand. Vronsky warmly pressed his outstretched hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, as a weapon I may be of some use. But as a man, I&rsquo;m a
        wreck,&rdquo; he jerked out.
      </p>

      <p>
        He could hardly speak for the throbbing ache in his strong teeth, that
        were like rows of ivory in his mouth. He was silent, and his eyes rested
        on the wheels of the tender, slowly and smoothly rolling along the
        rails.
      </p>

      <p>
        And all at once a different pain, not an ache, but an inner trouble,
        that set his whole being in anguish, made him for an instant forget his
        toothache. As he glanced at the tender and the rails, under the
        influence of the conversation with a friend he had not met since his
        misfortune, he suddenly recalled
        <i>her</i>&mdash;that is, what was left of her when he had run like one
        distraught into the cloak room of the railway station&mdash;on the
        table, shamelessly sprawling out among strangers, the bloodstained body
        so lately full of life; the head unhurt dropping back with its weight of
        hair, and the curling tresses about the temples, and the exquisite face,
        with red, half-opened mouth, the strange, fixed expression, piteous on
        the lips and awful in the still open eyes, that seemed to utter that
        fearful phrase&mdash;that he would be sorry for it&mdash;that she had
        said when they were quarreling.
      </p>

      <p>
        And he tried to think of her as she was when he met her the first time,
        at a railway station too, mysterious, exquisite, loving, seeking and
        giving happiness, and not cruelly revengeful as he remembered her on
        that last moment. He tried to recall his best moments with her, but
        those moments were poisoned forever. He could only think of her as
        triumphant, successful in her menace of a wholly useless remorse never
        to be effaced. He lost all consciousness of toothache, and his face
        worked with sobs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Passing twice up and down beside the baggage in silence and regaining
        his self-possession, he addressed Sergey Ivanovitch calmly:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You have had no telegrams since yesterday&rsquo;s? Yes, driven
        back for a third time, but a decisive engagement expected for
        tomorrow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And after talking a little more of King Milan&rsquo;s proclamation, and
        the immense effect it might have, they parted, going to their carriages
        on hearing the second bell.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 6</h3>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch had not telegraphed to his brother to send to meet
        him, as he did not know when he should be able to leave Moscow. Levin
        was not at home when Katavasov and Sergey Ivanovitch in a fly hired at
        the station drove up to the steps of the Pokrovskoe house, as black as
        Moors from the dust of the road. Kitty, sitting on the balcony with her
        father and sister, recognized her brother-in-law, and ran down to meet
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a shame not to have let us know,&rdquo; she said, giving her
        hand to Sergey Ivanovitch, and putting her forehead up for him to kiss.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We drove here capitally, and have not put you out,&rdquo;
        answered Sergey Ivanovitch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so dirty. I&rsquo;m afraid
        to touch you. I&rsquo;ve been so busy, I didn&rsquo;t know when I should
        be able to tear myself away. And so you&rsquo;re still as ever enjoying
        your peaceful, quiet happiness,&rdquo; he said, smiling, &ldquo;out of
        the reach of the current in your peaceful backwater. Here&rsquo;s our
        friend Fyodor Vassilievitch who has succeeded in getting here at
        last.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not a negro, I shall look like a human being when I
        wash,&rdquo; said Katavasov in his jesting fashion, and he shook hands
        and smiled, his teeth flashing white in his black face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kostya will be delighted. He has gone to his settlement.
        It&rsquo;s time he should be home.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Busy as ever with his farming. It really is a peaceful
        backwater,&rdquo; said Katavasov; &ldquo;while we in town think of
        nothing but the Servian war. Well, how does our friend look at it?
        He&rsquo;s sure not to think like other people.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, like everybody else,&rdquo; Kitty
        answered, a little embarrassed, looking round at Sergey Ivanovitch.
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send to fetch him. Papa&rsquo;s staying with us.
        He&rsquo;s only just come home from abroad.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And making arrangements to send for Levin and for the guests to wash,
        one in his room and the other in what had been Dolly&rsquo;s, and giving
        orders for their luncheon, Kitty ran out onto the balcony, enjoying the
        freedom, and rapidity of movement, of which she had been deprived during
        the months of her pregnancy.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov, a professor,&rdquo;
        she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a bore in this heat,&rdquo; said the prince.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, papa, he&rsquo;s very nice, and Kostya&rsquo;s very fond of
        him,&rdquo; Kitty said, with a deprecating smile, noticing the irony on
        her father&rsquo;s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You go to them, darling,&rdquo; said Kitty to her sister,
        &ldquo;and entertain them. They saw Stiva at the station; he was quite
        well. And I must run to Mitya. As ill-luck would have it, I
        haven&rsquo;t fed him since tea. He&rsquo;s awake now, and sure to be
        screaming.&rdquo; And feeling a rush of milk, she hurried to the
        nursery.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was not a mere guess; her connection with the child was still so
        close, that she could gauge by the flow of her milk his need of food,
        and knew for certain he was hungry.
      </p>

      <p>
        She knew he was crying before she reached the nursery. And he was indeed
        crying. She heard him and hastened. But the faster she went, the louder
        he screamed. It was a fine healthy scream, hungry and impatient.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Has he been screaming long, nurse, very long?&rdquo; said Kitty
        hurriedly, seating herself on a chair, and preparing to give the baby
        the breast. &ldquo;But give me him quickly. Oh, nurse, how tiresome you
        are! There, tie the cap afterwards, do!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The baby&rsquo;s greedy scream was passing into sobs.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t manage so, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Agafea
        Mihalovna, who was almost always to be found in the nursery. &ldquo;He
        must be put straight. A-oo! a-oo!&rdquo; she chanted over him, paying no
        attention to the mother.
      </p>

      <p>
        The nurse brought the baby to his mother. Agafea Mihalovna followed him
        with a face dissolving with tenderness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He knows me, he knows me. In God&rsquo;s faith, Katerina
        Alexandrovna, ma&rsquo;am, he knew me!&rdquo; Agafea Mihalovna cried
        above the baby&rsquo;s screams.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Kitty did not hear her words. Her impatience kept growing, like the
        baby&rsquo;s.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their impatience hindered things for a while. The baby could not get
        hold of the breast right, and was furious.
      </p>

      <p>
        At last, after despairing, breathless screaming, and vain sucking,
        things went right, and mother and child felt simultaneously soothed, and
        both subsided into calm.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But poor darling, he&rsquo;s all in perspiration!&rdquo; said
        Kitty in a whisper, touching the baby.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What makes you think he knows you?&rdquo; she added, with a
        sidelong glance at the baby&rsquo;s eyes, that peered roguishly, as she
        fancied, from under his cap, at his rhythmically puffing cheeks, and the
        little red-palmed hand he was waving.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Impossible! If he knew anyone, he would have known me,&rdquo;
        said Kitty, in response to Agafea Mihalovna&rsquo;s statement, and she
        smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        She smiled because, though she said he could not know her, in her heart
        she was sure that he knew not merely Agafea Mihalovna, but that he knew
        and understood everything, and knew and understood a great deal too that
        no one else knew, and that she, his mother, had learned and come to
        understand only through him. To Agafea Mihalovna, to the nurse, to his
        grandfather, to his father even, Mitya was a living being, requiring
        only material care, but for his mother he had long been a mortal being,
        with whom there had been a whole series of spiritual relations already.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;When he wakes up, please God, you shall see for yourself. Then
        when I do like this, he simply beams on me, the darling! Simply beams
        like a sunny day!&rdquo; said Agafea Mihalovna.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, well; then we shall see,&rdquo; whispered Kitty. &ldquo;But
        now go away, he&rsquo;s going to sleep.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 7</h3>

      <p>
        Agafea Mihalovna went out on tiptoe; the nurse let down the blind,
        chased a fly out from under the muslin canopy of the crib, and a
        bumblebee struggling on the window-frame, and sat down waving a faded
        branch of birch over the mother and the baby.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How hot it is! if God would send a drop of rain,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, sh&mdash;sh&mdash;sh&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; was all Kitty
        answered, rocking a little, and tenderly squeezing the plump little arm,
        with rolls of fat at the wrist, which Mitya still waved feebly as he
        opened and shut his eyes. That hand worried Kitty; she longed to kiss
        the little hand, but was afraid to for fear of waking the baby. At last
        the little hand ceased waving, and the eyes closed. Only from time to
        time, as he went on sucking, the baby raised his long, curly eyelashes
        and peeped at his mother with wet eyes, that looked black in the
        twilight. The nurse had left off fanning, and was dozing. From above
        came the peals of the old prince&rsquo;s voice, and the chuckle of
        Katavasov.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They have got into talk without me,&rdquo; thought Kitty,
        &ldquo;but still it&rsquo;s vexing that Kostya&rsquo;s out. He&rsquo;s
        sure to have gone to the bee-house again. Though it&rsquo;s a pity
        he&rsquo;s there so often, still I&rsquo;m glad. It distracts his mind.
        He&rsquo;s become altogether happier and better now than in the spring.
        He used to be so gloomy and worried that I felt frightened for him. And
        how absurd he is!&rdquo; she whispered, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        She knew what worried her husband. It was his unbelief. Although, if she
        had been asked whether she supposed that in the future life, if he did
        not believe, he would be damned, she would have had to admit that he
        would be damned, his unbelief did not cause her unhappiness. And she,
        confessing that for an unbeliever there can be no salvation, and loving
        her husband&rsquo;s soul more than anything in the world, thought with a
        smile of his unbelief, and told herself that he was absurd.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What does he keep reading philosophy of some sort for all this
        year?&rdquo; she wondered. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s all written in those
        books, he can understand them. If it&rsquo;s all wrong, why does he read
        them? He says himself that he would like to believe. Then why is it he
        doesn&rsquo;t believe? Surely from his thinking so much? And he thinks
        so much from being solitary. He&rsquo;s always alone, alone. He
        can&rsquo;t talk about it all to us. I fancy he&rsquo;ll be glad of
        these visitors, especially Katavasov. He likes discussions with
        them,&rdquo; she thought, and passed instantly to the consideration of
        where it would be more convenient to put Katavasov, to sleep alone or to
        share Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s room. And then an idea suddenly struck
        her, which made her shudder and even disturb Mitya, who glanced severely
        at her. &ldquo;I do believe the laundress hasn&rsquo;t sent the washing
        yet, and all the best sheets are in use. If I don&rsquo;t see to it,
        Agafea Mihalovna will give Sergey Ivanovitch the wrong sheets,&rdquo;
        and at the very idea of this the blood rushed to Kitty&rsquo;s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I will arrange it,&rdquo; she decided, and going back to her
        former thoughts, she remembered that some spiritual question of
        importance had been interrupted, and she began to recall what.
        &ldquo;Yes, Kostya, an unbeliever,&rdquo; she thought again with a
        smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, an unbeliever then! Better let him always be one than like
        Madame Stahl, or what I tried to be in those days abroad. No, he
        won&rsquo;t ever sham anything.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And a recent instance of his goodness rose vividly to her mind. A
        fortnight ago a penitent letter had come from Stepan Arkadyevitch to
        Dolly. He besought her to save his honor, to sell her estate to pay his
        debts. Dolly was in despair, she detested her husband, despised him,
        pitied him, resolved on a separation, resolved to refuse, but ended by
        agreeing to sell part of her property. After that, with an irrepressible
        smile of tenderness, Kitty recalled her husband&rsquo;s shamefaced
        embarrassment, his repeated awkward efforts to approach the subject, and
        how at last, having thought of the one means of helping Dolly without
        wounding her pride, he had suggested to Kitty&mdash;what had not
        occurred to her before&mdash;that she should give up her share of the
        property.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He an unbeliever indeed! With his heart, his dread of offending
        anyone, even a child! Everything for others, nothing for himself. Sergey
        Ivanovitch simply considers it as Kostya&rsquo;s duty to be his steward.
        And it&rsquo;s the same with his sister. Now Dolly and her children are
        under his guardianship; all these peasants who come to him every day, as
        though he were bound to be at their service.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, only be like your father, only like him,&rdquo; she said,
        handing Mitya over to the nurse, and putting her lips to his cheek.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 8</h3>

      <p>
        Ever since, by his beloved brother&rsquo;s deathbed, Levin had first
        glanced into the questions of life and death in the light of these new
        convictions, as he called them, which had during the period from his
        twentieth to his thirty-fourth year imperceptibly replaced his childish
        and youthful beliefs&mdash;he had been stricken with horror, not so much
        of death, as of life, without any knowledge of whence, and why, and how,
        and what it was. The physical organization, its decay, the
        indestructibility of matter, the law of the conservation of energy,
        evolution, were the words which usurped the place of his old belief.
        These words and the ideas associated with them were very well for
        intellectual purposes. But for life they yielded nothing, and Levin felt
        suddenly like a man who has changed his warm fur cloak for a muslin
        garment, and going for the first time into the frost is immediately
        convinced, not by reason, but by his whole nature that he is as good as
        naked, and that he must infallibly perish miserably.
      </p>

      <p>
        From that moment, though he did not distinctly face it, and still went
        on living as before, Levin had never lost this sense of terror at his
        lack of knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        He vaguely felt, too, that what he called his new convictions were not
        merely lack of knowledge, but that they were part of a whole order of
        ideas, in which no knowledge of what he needed was possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, marriage, with the new joys and duties bound up with it, had
        completely crowded out these thoughts. But of late, while he was staying
        in Moscow after his wife&rsquo;s confinement, with nothing to do, the
        question that clamored for solution had more and more often, more and
        more insistently, haunted Levin&rsquo;s mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        The question was summed up for him thus: &ldquo;If I do not accept the
        answers Christianity gives to the problems of my life, what answers do I
        accept?&rdquo; And in the whole arsenal of his convictions, so far from
        finding any satisfactory answers, he was utterly unable to find anything
        at all like an answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was in the position of a man seeking food in toy shops and tool
        shops.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instinctively, unconsciously, with every book, with every conversation,
        with every man he met, he was on the lookout for light on these
        questions and their solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        What puzzled and distracted him above everything was that the majority
        of men of his age and circle had, like him, exchanged their old beliefs
        for the same new convictions, and yet saw nothing to lament in this, and
        were perfectly satisfied and serene. So that, apart from the principal
        question, Levin was tortured by other questions too. Were these people
        sincere? he asked himself, or were they playing a part? or was it that
        they understood the answers science gave to these problems in some
        different, clearer sense than he did? And he assiduously studied both
        these men&rsquo;s opinions and the books which treated of these
        scientific explanations.
      </p>

      <p>
        One fact he had found out since these questions had engrossed his mind,
        was that he had been quite wrong in supposing from the recollections of
        the circle of his young days at college, that religion had outlived its
        day, and that it was now practically non-existent. All the people
        nearest to him who were good in their lives were believers. The old
        prince, and Lvov, whom he liked so much, and Sergey Ivanovitch, and all
        the women believed, and his wife believed as simply as he had believed
        in his earliest childhood, and ninety-nine hundredths of the Russian
        people, all the working people for whose life he felt the deepest
        respect, believed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another fact of which he became convinced, after reading many scientific
        books, was that the men who shared his views had no other construction
        to put on them, and that they gave no explanation of the questions which
        he felt he could not live without answering, but simply ignored their
        existence and attempted to explain other questions of no possible
        interest to him, such as the evolution of organisms, the materialistic
        theory of consciousness, and so forth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, during his wife&rsquo;s confinement, something had happened
        that seemed extraordinary to him. He, an unbeliever, had fallen into
        praying, and at the moment he prayed, he believed. But that moment had
        passed, and he could not make his state of mind at that moment fit into
        the rest of his life.
      </p>

      <p>
        He could not admit that at that moment he knew the truth, and that now
        he was wrong; for as soon as he began thinking calmly about it, it all
        fell to pieces. He could not admit that he was mistaken then, for his
        spiritual condition then was precious to him, and to admit that it was a
        proof of weakness would have been to desecrate those moments. He was
        miserably divided against himself, and strained all his spiritual forces
        to the utmost to escape from this condition.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 9</h3>

      <p>
        These doubts fretted and harassed him, growing weaker or stronger from
        time to time, but never leaving him. He read and thought, and the more
        he read and the more he thought, the further he felt from the aim he was
        pursuing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of late in Moscow and in the country, since he had become convinced that
        he would find no solution in the materialists, he had read and re-read
        thoroughly Plato, Spinoza, Kant, Schelling, Hegel, and Schopenhauer, the
        philosophers who gave a non-materialistic explanation of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their ideas seemed to him fruitful when he was reading or was himself
        seeking arguments to refute other theories, especially those of the
        materialists; but as soon as he began to read or sought for himself a
        solution of problems, the same thing always happened. As long as he
        followed the fixed definition of obscure words such as
        <i>spirit, will, freedom, essence,</i> purposely letting himself go into
        the snare of words the philosophers set for him, he seemed to comprehend
        something. But he had only to forget the artificial train of reasoning,
        and to turn from life itself to what had satisfied him while thinking in
        accordance with the fixed definitions, and all this artificial edifice
        fell to pieces at once like a house of cards, and it became clear that
        the edifice had been built up out of those transposed words, apart from
        anything in life more important than reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        At one time, reading Schopenhauer, he put in place of his
        <i>will</i> the word <i>love</i>, and for a couple of days this new
        philosophy charmed him, till he removed a little away from it. But then,
        when he turned from life itself to glance at it again, it fell away too,
        and proved to be the same muslin garment with no warmth in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        His brother Sergey Ivanovitch advised him to read the theological works
        of Homiakov. Levin read the second volume of Homiakov&rsquo;s works, and
        in spite of the elegant, epigrammatic, argumentative style which at
        first repelled him, he was impressed by the doctrine of the church he
        found in them. He was struck at first by the idea that the apprehension
        of divine truths had not been vouchsafed to man, but to a corporation of
        men bound together by love&mdash;to the church. What delighted him was
        the thought how much easier it was to believe in a still existing living
        church, embracing all the beliefs of men, and having God at its head,
        and therefore holy and infallible, and from it to accept the faith in
        God, in the creation, the fall, the redemption, than to begin with God,
        a mysterious, far-away God, the creation, etc. But afterwards, on
        reading a Catholic writer&rsquo;s history of the church, and then a
        Greek orthodox writer&rsquo;s history of the church, and seeing that the
        two churches, in their very conception infallible, each deny the
        authority of the other, Homiakov&rsquo;s doctrine of the church lost all
        its charm for him, and this edifice crumbled into dust like the
        philosophers&rsquo; edifices.
      </p>

      <p>
        All that spring he was not himself, and went through fearful moments of
        horror.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Without knowing what I am and why I am here, life&rsquo;s
        impossible; and that I can&rsquo;t know, and so I can&rsquo;t
        live,&rdquo; Levin said to himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In infinite time, in infinite matter, in infinite space, is
        formed a bubble-organism, and that bubble lasts a while and bursts, and
        that bubble is Me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        It was an agonizing error, but it was the sole logical result of ages of
        human thought in that direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was the ultimate belief on which all the systems elaborated by
        human thought in almost all their ramifications rested. It was the
        prevalent conviction, and of all other explanations Levin had
        unconsciously, not knowing when or how, chosen it, as anyway the
        clearest, and made it his own.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it was not merely a falsehood, it was the cruel jeer of some wicked
        power, some evil, hateful power, to whom one could not submit.
      </p>

      <p>
        He must escape from this power. And the means of escape every man had in
        his own hands. He had but to cut short this dependence on evil. And
        there was one means&mdash;death.
      </p>

      <p>
        And Levin, a happy father and husband, in perfect health, was several
        times so near suicide that he hid the cord that he might not be tempted
        to hang himself, and was afraid to go out with his gun for fear of
        shooting himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Levin did not shoot himself, and did not hang himself; he went on
        living.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 10</h3>

      <p>
        When Levin thought what he was and what he was living for, he could find
        no answer to the questions and was reduced to despair, but he left off
        questioning himself about it. It seemed as though he knew both what he
        was and for what he was living, for he acted and lived resolutely and
        without hesitation. Indeed, in these latter days he was far more decided
        and unhesitating in life than he had ever been.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he went back to the country at the beginning of June, he went back
        also to his usual pursuits. The management of the estate, his relations
        with the peasants and the neighbors, the care of his household, the
        management of his sister&rsquo;s and brother&rsquo;s property, of which
        he had the direction, his relations with his wife and kindred, the care
        of his child, and the new bee-keeping hobby he had taken up that spring,
        filled all his time.
      </p>

      <p>
        These things occupied him now, not because he justified them to himself
        by any sort of general principles, as he had done in former days; on the
        contrary, disappointed by the failure of his former efforts for the
        general welfare, and too much occupied with his own thought and the mass
        of business with which he was burdened from all sides, he had completely
        given up thinking of the general good, and he busied himself with all
        this work simply because it seemed to him that he must do what he was
        doing&mdash;that he could not do otherwise. In former days&mdash;almost
        from childhood, and increasingly up to full manhood&mdash;when he had
        tried to do anything that would be good for all, for humanity, for
        Russia, for the whole village, he had noticed that the idea of it had
        been pleasant, but the work itself had always been incoherent, that then
        he had never had a full conviction of its absolute necessity, and that
        the work that had begun by seeming so great, had grown less and less,
        till it vanished into nothing. But now, since his marriage, when he had
        begun to confine himself more and more to living for himself, though he
        experienced no delight at all at the thought of the work he was doing,
        he felt a complete conviction of its necessity, saw that it succeeded
        far better than in old days, and that it kept on growing more and more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, involuntarily it seemed, he cut more and more deeply into the soil
        like a plough, so that he could not be drawn out without turning aside
        the furrow.
      </p>

      <p>
        To live the same family life as his father and forefathers&mdash;that
        is, in the same condition of culture&mdash;and to bring up his children
        in the same, was incontestably necessary. It was as necessary as dining
        when one was hungry. And to do this, just as it was necessary to cook
        dinner, it was necessary to keep the mechanism of agriculture at
        Pokrovskoe going so as to yield an income. Just as incontestably as it
        was necessary to repay a debt was it necessary to keep the property in
        such a condition that his son, when he received it as a heritage, would
        say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to his father as Levin had said &ldquo;thank
        you&rdquo; to his grandfather for all he built and planted. And to do
        this it was necessary to look after the land himself, not to let it, and
        to breed cattle, manure the fields, and plant timber.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was impossible not to look after the affairs of Sergey Ivanovitch, of
        his sister, of the peasants who came to him for advice and were
        accustomed to do so&mdash;as impossible as to fling down a child one is
        carrying in one&rsquo;s arms. It was necessary to look after the comfort
        of his sister-in-law and her children, and of his wife and baby, and it
        was impossible not to spend with them at least a short time each day.
      </p>

      <p>
        And all this, together with shooting and his new bee-keeping, filled up
        the whole of Levin&rsquo;s life, which had no meaning at all for him,
        when he began to think.
      </p>

      <p>
        But besides knowing thoroughly what he had to do, Levin knew in just the
        same way <i>how</i> he had to do it all, and what was more important
        than the rest.
      </p>

      <p>
        He knew he must hire laborers as cheaply as possible; but to hire men
        under bond, paying them in advance at less than the current rate of
        wages, was what he must not do, even though it was very profitable.
        Selling straw to the peasants in times of scarcity of provender was what
        he might do, even though he felt sorry for them; but the tavern and the
        pothouse must be put down, though they were a source of income. Felling
        timber must be punished as severely as possible, but he could not exact
        forfeits for cattle being driven onto his fields; and though it annoyed
        the keeper and made the peasants not afraid to graze their cattle on his
        land, he could not keep their cattle as a punishment.
      </p>

      <p>
        To Pyotr, who was paying a money-lender ten per cent. a month, he must
        lend a sum of money to set him free. But he could not let off peasants
        who did not pay their rent, nor let them fall into arrears. It was
        impossible to overlook the bailiff&rsquo;s not having mown the meadows
        and letting the hay spoil; and it was equally impossible to mow those
        acres where a young copse had been planted. It was impossible to excuse
        a laborer who had gone home in the busy season because his father was
        dying, however sorry he might feel for him, and he must subtract from
        his pay those costly months of idleness. But it was impossible not to
        allow monthly rations to the old servants who were of no use for
        anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin knew that when he got home he must first of all go to his wife,
        who was unwell, and that the peasants who had been waiting for three
        hours to see him could wait a little longer. He knew too that,
        regardless of all the pleasure he felt in taking a swarm, he must forego
        that pleasure, and leave the old man to see to the bees alone, while he
        talked to the peasants who had come after him to the bee-house.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether he were acting rightly or wrongly he did not know, and far from
        trying to prove that he was, nowadays he avoided all thought or talk
        about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reasoning had brought him to doubt, and prevented him from seeing what
        he ought to do and what he ought not. When he did not think, but simply
        lived, he was continually aware of the presence of an infallible judge
        in his soul, determining which of two possible courses of action was the
        better and which was the worse, and as soon as he did not act rightly,
        he was at once aware of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        So he lived, not knowing and not seeing any chance of knowing what he
        was and what he was living for, and harassed at this lack of knowledge
        to such a point that he was afraid of suicide, and yet firmly laying
        down his own individual definite path in life.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 11</h3>

      <p>
        The day on which Sergey Ivanovitch came to Pokrovskoe was one of
        Levin&rsquo;s most painful days. It was the very busiest working time,
        when all the peasantry show an extraordinary intensity of self-sacrifice
        in labor, such as is never shown in any other conditions of life, and
        would be highly esteemed if the men who showed these qualities
        themselves thought highly of them, and if it were not repeated every
        year, and if the results of this intense labor were not so simple.
      </p>

      <p>
        To reap and bind the rye and oats and to carry it, to mow the meadows,
        turn over the fallows, thrash the seed and sow the winter corn&mdash;all
        this seems so simple and ordinary; but to succeed in getting through it
        all everyone in the village, from the old man to the young child, must
        toil incessantly for three or four weeks, three times as hard as usual,
        living on rye-beer, onions, and black bread, thrashing and carrying the
        sheaves at night, and not giving more than two or three hours in the
        twenty-four to sleep. And every year this is done all over Russia.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having lived the greater part of his life in the country and in the
        closest relations with the peasants, Levin always felt in this busy time
        that he was infected by this general quickening of energy in the people.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the early morning he rode over to the first sowing of the rye, and to
        the oats, which were being carried to the stacks, and returning home at
        the time his wife and sister-in-law were getting up, he drank coffee
        with them and walked to the farm, where a new thrashing machine was to
        be set working to get ready the seed-corn.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was standing in the cool granary, still fragrant with the leaves of
        the hazel branches interlaced on the freshly peeled aspen beams of the
        new thatch roof. He gazed through the open door in which the dry bitter
        dust of the thrashing whirled and played, at the grass of the thrashing
        floor in the sunlight and the fresh straw that had been brought in from
        the barn, then at the speckly-headed, white-breasted swallows that flew
        chirping in under the roof and, fluttering their wings, settled in the
        crevices of the doorway, then at the peasants bustling in the dark,
        dusty barn, and he thought strange thoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why is it all being done?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Why am I
        standing here, making them work? What are they all so busy for, trying
        to show their zeal before me? What is that old Matrona, my old friend,
        toiling for? (I doctored her, when the beam fell on her in the
        fire)&rdquo; he thought, looking at a thin old woman who was raking up
        the grain, moving painfully with her bare, sun-blackened feet over the
        uneven, rough floor. &ldquo;Then she recovered, but today or tomorrow or
        in ten years she won&rsquo;t; they&rsquo;ll bury her, and nothing will
        be left either of her or of that smart girl in the red jacket, who with
        that skillful, soft action shakes the ears out of their husks.
        They&rsquo;ll bury her and this piebald horse, and very soon too,&rdquo;
        he thought, gazing at the heavily moving, panting horse that kept
        walking up the wheel that turned under him. &ldquo;And they will bury
        her and Fyodor the thrasher with his curly beard full of chaff and his
        shirt torn on his white shoulders&mdash;they will bury him. He&rsquo;s
        untying the sheaves, and giving orders, and shouting to the women, and
        quickly setting straight the strap on the moving wheel. And what&rsquo;s
        more, it&rsquo;s not them alone&mdash;me they&rsquo;ll bury too, and
        nothing will be left. What for?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He thought this, and at the same time looked at his watch to reckon how
        much they thrashed in an hour. He wanted to know this so as to judge by
        it the task to set for the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll soon be one, and they&rsquo;re only beginning the
        third sheaf,&rdquo; thought Levin. He went up to the man that was
        feeding the machine, and shouting over the roar of the machine he told
        him to put it in more slowly. &ldquo;You put in too much at a time,
        Fyodor. Do you see&mdash;it gets choked, that&rsquo;s why it isn&rsquo;t
        getting on. Do it evenly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Fyodor, black with the dust that clung to his moist face, shouted
        something in response, but still went on doing it as Levin did not want
        him to.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin, going up to the machine, moved Fyodor aside, and began feeding
        the corn in himself. Working on till the peasants&rsquo; dinner hour,
        which was not long in coming, he went out of the barn with Fyodor and
        fell into talk with him, stopping beside a neat yellow sheaf of rye laid
        on the thrashing floor for seed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fyodor came from a village at some distance from the one in which Levin
        had once allotted land to his cooperative association. Now it had been
        let to a former house porter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin talked to Fyodor about this land and asked whether Platon, a
        well-to-do peasant of good character belonging to the same village,
        would not take the land for the coming year.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a high rent; it wouldn&rsquo;t pay Platon, Konstantin
        Dmitrievitch,&rdquo; answered the peasant, picking the ears off his
        sweat-drenched shirt.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But how does Kirillov make it pay?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Mituh!&rdquo; (so the peasant called the house porter, in a tone
        of contempt), &ldquo;you may be sure he&rsquo;ll make it pay, Konstantin
        Dmitrievitch! He&rsquo;ll get his share, however he has to squeeze to
        get it! He&rsquo;s no mercy on a Christian. But Uncle Fokanitch&rdquo;
        (so he called the old peasant Platon), &ldquo;do you suppose he&rsquo;d
        flay the skin off a man? Where there&rsquo;s debt, he&rsquo;ll let
        anyone off. And he&rsquo;ll not wring the last penny out. He&rsquo;s a
        man too.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But why will he let anyone off?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, of course, folks are different. One man lives for his
        own wants and nothing else, like Mituh, he only thinks of filling his
        belly, but Fokanitch is a righteous man. He lives for his soul. He does
        not forget God.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How thinks of God? How does he live for his soul?&rdquo; Levin
        almost shouted.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, to be sure, in truth, in God&rsquo;s way. Folks are
        different. Take you now, you wouldn&rsquo;t wrong a man....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, good-bye!&rdquo; said Levin, breathless with
        excitement, and turning round he took his stick and walked quickly away
        towards home. At the peasant&rsquo;s words that Fokanitch lived for his
        soul, in truth, in God&rsquo;s way, undefined but significant ideas
        seemed to burst out as though they had been locked up, and all striving
        towards one goal, they thronged whirling through his head, blinding him
        with their light.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 12</h3>

      <p>
        Levin strode along the highroad, absorbed not so much in his thoughts
        (he could not yet disentangle them) as in his spiritual condition,
        unlike anything he had experienced before.
      </p>

      <p>
        The words uttered by the peasant had acted on his soul like an electric
        shock, suddenly transforming and combining into a single whole the whole
        swarm of disjointed, impotent, separate thoughts that incessantly
        occupied his mind. These thoughts had unconsciously been in his mind
        even when he was talking about the land.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was aware of something new in his soul, and joyfully tested this new
        thing, not yet knowing what it was.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not living for his own wants, but for God? For what God? And
        could one say anything more senseless than what he said? He said that
        one must not live for one&rsquo;s own wants, that is, that one must not
        live for what we understand, what we are attracted by, what we desire,
        but must live for something incomprehensible, for God, whom no one can
        understand nor even define. What of it? Didn&rsquo;t I understand those
        senseless words of Fyodor&rsquo;s? And understanding them, did I doubt
        of their truth? Did I think them stupid, obscure, inexact? No, I
        understood him, and exactly as he understands the words. I understood
        them more fully and clearly than I understand anything in life, and
        never in my life have I doubted nor can I doubt about it. And not only
        I, but everyone, the whole world understands nothing fully but this, and
        about this only they have no doubt and are always agreed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And I looked out for miracles, complained that I did not see a
        miracle which would convince me. A material miracle would have persuaded
        me. And here is a miracle, the sole miracle possible, continually
        existing, surrounding me on all sides, and I never noticed it!
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Fyodor says that Kirillov lives for his belly. That&rsquo;s
        comprehensible and rational. All of us as rational beings can&rsquo;t do
        anything else but live for our belly. And all of a sudden the same
        Fyodor says that one mustn&rsquo;t live for one&rsquo;s belly, but must
        live for truth, for God, and at a hint I understand him! And I and
        millions of men, men who lived ages ago and men living
        now&mdash;peasants, the poor in spirit and the learned, who have thought
        and written about it, in their obscure words saying the same
        thing&mdash;we are all agreed about this one thing: what we must live
        for and what is good. I and all men have only one firm, incontestable,
        clear knowledge, and that knowledge cannot be explained by the
        reason&mdash;it is outside it, and has no causes and can have no
        effects.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;If goodness has causes, it is not goodness; if it has effects, a
        reward, it is not goodness either. So goodness is outside the chain of
        cause and effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And yet I know it, and we all know it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What could be a greater miracle than that?
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Can I have found the solution of it all? can my sufferings be
        over?&rdquo; thought Levin, striding along the dusty road, not noticing
        the heat nor his weariness, and experiencing a sense of relief from
        prolonged suffering. This feeling was so delicious that it seemed to him
        incredible. He was breathless with emotion and incapable of going
        farther; he turned off the road into the forest and lay down in the
        shade of an aspen on the uncut grass. He took his hat off his hot head
        and lay propped on his elbow in the lush, feathery, woodland grass.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I must make it clear to myself and understand,&rdquo; he
        thought, looking intently at the untrampled grass before him, and
        following the movements of a green beetle, advancing along a blade of
        couch-grass and lifting up in its progress a leaf of goat-weed.
        &ldquo;What have I discovered?&rdquo; he asked himself, bending aside
        the leaf of goat-weed out of the beetle&rsquo;s way and twisting another
        blade of grass above for the beetle to cross over onto it. &ldquo;What
        is it makes me glad? What have I discovered?
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have discovered nothing. I have only found out what I knew. I
        understand the force that in the past gave me life, and now too gives me
        life. I have been set free from falsity, I have found the Master.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Of old I used to say that in my body, that in the body of this
        grass and of this beetle (there, she didn&rsquo;t care for the grass,
        she&rsquo;s opened her wings and flown away), there was going on a
        transformation of matter in accordance with physical, chemical, and
        physiological laws. And in all of us, as well as in the aspens and the
        clouds and the misty patches, there was a process of evolution.
        Evolution from what? into what?&mdash;Eternal evolution and struggle....
        As though there could be any sort of tendency and struggle in the
        eternal! And I was astonished that in spite of the utmost effort of
        thought along that road I could not discover the meaning of life, the
        meaning of my impulses and yearnings. Now I say that I know the meaning
        of my life: &lsquo;To live for God, for my soul.&rsquo; And this
        meaning, in spite of its clearness, is mysterious and marvelous. Such,
        indeed, is the meaning of everything existing. Yes, pride,&rdquo; he
        said to himself, turning over on his stomach and beginning to tie a
        noose of blades of grass, trying not to break them.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And not merely pride of intellect, but dulness of intellect. And
        most of all, the deceitfulness; yes, the deceitfulness of intellect. The
        cheating knavishness of intellect, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he said to
        himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        And he briefly went through, mentally, the whole course of his ideas
        during the last two years, the beginning of which was the clear
        confronting of death at the sight of his dear brother hopelessly ill.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, for the first time, grasping that for every man, and himself too,
        there was nothing in store but suffering, death, and forgetfulness, he
        had made up his mind that life was impossible like that, and that he
        must either interpret life so that it would not present itself to him as
        the evil jest of some devil, or shoot himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        But he had not done either, but had gone on living, thinking, and
        feeling, and had even at that very time married, and had had many joys
        and had been happy, when he was not thinking of the meaning of his life.
      </p>

      <p>
        What did this mean? It meant that he had been living rightly, but
        thinking wrongly.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had lived (without being aware of it) on those spiritual truths that
        he had sucked in with his mother&rsquo;s milk, but he had thought, not
        merely without recognition of these truths, but studiously ignoring
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now it was clear to him that he could only live by virtue of the beliefs
        in which he had been brought up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What should I have been, and how should I have spent my life, if
        I had not had these beliefs, if I had not known that I must live for God
        and not for my own desires? I should have robbed and lied and killed.
        Nothing of what makes the chief happiness of my life would have existed
        for me.&rdquo; And with the utmost stretch of imagination he could not
        conceive the brutal creature he would have been himself, if he had not
        known what he was living for.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I looked for an answer to my question. And thought could not give
        an answer to my question&mdash;it is incommensurable with my question.
        The answer has been given me by life itself, in my knowledge of what is
        right and what is wrong. And that knowledge I did not arrive at in any
        way, it was given to me as to all men, <i>given</i>, because I could not
        have got it from anywhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where could I have got it? By reason could I have arrived at
        knowing that I must love my neighbor and not oppress him? I was told
        that in my childhood, and I believed it gladly, for they told me what
        was already in my soul. But who discovered it? Not reason. Reason
        discovered the struggle for existence, and the law that requires us to
        oppress all who hinder the satisfaction of our desires. That is the
        deduction of reason. But loving one&rsquo;s neighbor reason could never
        discover, because it&rsquo;s irrational.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 13</h3>

      <p>
        And Levin remembered a scene he had lately witnessed between Dolly and
        her children. The children, left to themselves, had begun cooking
        raspberries over the candles and squirting milk into each other&rsquo;s
        mouths with a syringe. Their mother, catching them at these pranks,
        began reminding them in Levin&rsquo;s presence of the trouble their
        mischief gave to the grown-up people, and that this trouble was all for
        their sake, and that if they smashed the cups they would have nothing to
        drink their tea out of, and that if they wasted the milk, they would
        have nothing to eat, and die of hunger.
      </p>

      <p>
        And Levin had been struck by the passive, weary incredulity with which
        the children heard what their mother said to them. They were simply
        annoyed that their amusing play had been interrupted, and did not
        believe a word of what their mother was saying. They could not believe
        it indeed, for they could not take in the immensity of all they
        habitually enjoyed, and so could not conceive that what they were
        destroying was the very thing they lived by.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That all comes of itself,&rdquo; they thought, &ldquo;and
        there&rsquo;s nothing interesting or important about it because it has
        always been so, and always will be so. And it&rsquo;s all always the
        same. We&rsquo;ve no need to think about that, it&rsquo;s all ready. But
        we want to invent something of our own, and new. So we thought of
        putting raspberries in a cup, and cooking them over a candle, and
        squirting milk straight into each other&rsquo;s mouths. That&rsquo;s
        fun, and something new, and not a bit worse than drinking out of
        cups.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it just the same that we do, that I did, searching by
        the aid of reason for the significance of the forces of nature and the
        meaning of the life of man?&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t all the theories of philosophy do the same,
        trying by the path of thought, which is strange and not natural to man,
        to bring him to a knowledge of what he has known long ago, and knows so
        certainly that he could not live at all without it? Isn&rsquo;t it
        distinctly to be seen in the development of each philosopher&rsquo;s
        theory, that he knows what is the chief significance of life beforehand,
        just as positively as the peasant Fyodor, and not a bit more clearly
        than he, and is simply trying by a dubious intellectual path to come
        back to what everyone knows?
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Now then, leave the children to themselves to get things alone
        and make their crockery, get the milk from the cows, and so on. Would
        they be naughty then? Why, they&rsquo;d die of hunger! Well, then, leave
        us with our passions and thoughts, without any idea of the one God, of
        the Creator, or without any idea of what is right, without any idea of
        moral evil.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Just try and build up anything without those ideas!
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We only try to destroy them, because we&rsquo;re spiritually
        provided for. Exactly like the children!
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Whence have I that joyful knowledge, shared with the peasant,
        that alone gives peace to my soul? Whence did I get it?
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Brought up with an idea of God, a Christian, my whole life filled
        with the spiritual blessings Christianity has given me, full of them,
        and living on those blessings, like the children I did not understand
        them, and destroy, that is try to destroy, what I live by. And as soon
        as an important moment of life comes, like the children when they are
        cold and hungry, I turn to Him, and even less than the children when
        their mother scolds them for their childish mischief, do I feel that my
        childish efforts at wanton madness are reckoned against me.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, what I know, I know not by reason, but it has been given to
        me, revealed to me, and I know it with my heart, by faith in the chief
        thing taught by the church.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The church! the church!&rdquo; Levin repeated to himself. He
        turned over on the other side, and leaning on his elbow, fell to gazing
        into the distance at a herd of cattle crossing over to the river.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But can I believe in all the church teaches?&rdquo; he thought,
        trying himself, and thinking of everything that could destroy his
        present peace of mind. Intentionally he recalled all those doctrines of
        the church which had always seemed most strange and had always been a
        stumbling block to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The Creation? But how did I explain existence? By existence? By
        nothing? The devil and sin. But how do I explain evil?... The
        atonement?...
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I know nothing, nothing, and I can know nothing but what has
        been told to me and all men.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And it seemed to him that there was not a single article of faith of the
        church which could destroy the chief thing&mdash;faith in God, in
        goodness, as the one goal of man&rsquo;s destiny.
      </p>

      <p>
        Under every article of faith of the church could be put the faith in the
        service of truth instead of one&rsquo;s desires. And each doctrine did
        not simply leave that faith unshaken, each doctrine seemed essential to
        complete that great miracle, continually manifest upon earth, that made
        it possible for each man and millions of different sorts of men, wise
        men and imbeciles, old men and children&mdash;all men, peasants, Lvov,
        Kitty, beggars and kings to understand perfectly the same one thing, and
        to build up thereby that life of the soul which alone is worth living,
        and which alone is precious to us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lying on his back, he gazed up now into the high, cloudless sky.
        &ldquo;Do I not know that that is infinite space, and that it is not a
        round arch? But, however I screw up my eyes and strain my sight, I
        cannot see it not round and not bounded, and in spite of my knowing
        about infinite space, I am incontestably right when I see a solid blue
        dome, and more right than when I strain my eyes to see beyond it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin ceased thinking, and only, as it were, listened to mysterious
        voices that seemed talking joyfully and earnestly within him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Can this be faith?&rdquo; he thought, afraid to believe in his
        happiness. &ldquo;My God, I thank Thee!&rdquo; he said, gulping down his
        sobs, and with both hands brushing away the tears that filled his eyes.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 14</h3>

      <p>
        Levin looked before him and saw a herd of cattle, then he caught sight
        of his trap with Raven in the shafts, and the coachman, who, driving up
        to the herd, said something to the herdsman. Then he heard the rattle of
        the wheels and the snort of the sleek horse close by him. But he was so
        buried in his thoughts that he did not even wonder why the coachman had
        come for him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He only thought of that when the coachman had driven quite up to him and
        shouted to him. &ldquo;The mistress sent me. Your brother has come, and
        some gentleman with him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin got into the trap and took the reins. As though just roused out of
        sleep, for a long while Levin could not collect his faculties. He stared
        at the sleek horse flecked with lather between his haunches and on his
        neck, where the harness rubbed, stared at Ivan the coachman sitting
        beside him, and remembered that he was expecting his brother, thought
        that his wife was most likely uneasy at his long absence, and tried to
        guess who was the visitor who had come with his brother. And his brother
        and his wife and the unknown guest seemed to him now quite different
        from before. He fancied that now his relations with all men would be
        different.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;With my brother there will be none of that aloofness there always
        used to be between us, there will be no disputes; with Kitty there shall
        never be quarrels; with the visitor, whoever he may be, I will be
        friendly and nice; with the servants, with Ivan, it will all be
        different.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Pulling the stiff rein and holding in the good horse that snorted with
        impatience and seemed begging to be let go, Levin looked round at Ivan
        sitting beside him, not knowing what to do with his unoccupied hand,
        continually pressing down his shirt as it puffed out, and he tried to
        find something to start a conversation about with him. He would have
        said that Ivan had pulled the saddle-girth up too high, but that was
        like blame, and he longed for friendly, warm talk. Nothing else occurred
        to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Your honor must keep to the right and mind that stump,&rdquo;
        said the coachman, pulling the rein Levin held.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t touch and don&rsquo;t teach me!&rdquo; said
        Levin, angered by this interference. Now, as always, interference made
        him angry, and he felt sorrowfully at once how mistaken had been his
        supposition that his spiritual condition could immediately change him in
        contact with reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was not a quarter of a mile from home when he saw Grisha and Tanya
        running to meet him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Uncle Kostya! mamma&rsquo;s coming, and grandfather, and Sergey
        Ivanovitch, and someone else,&rdquo; they said, clambering up into the
        trap.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;An awfully terrible person! And he does like this with his
        arms,&rdquo; said Tanya, getting up in the trap and mimicking Katavasov.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Old or young?&rdquo; asked Levin, laughing, reminded of someone,
        he did not know whom, by Tanya&rsquo;s performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I hope it&rsquo;s not a tiresome person!&rdquo; thought
        Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as he turned, at a bend in the road, and saw the party coming,
        Levin recognized Katavasov in a straw hat, walking along swinging his
        arms just as Tanya had shown him. Katavasov was very fond of discussing
        metaphysics, having derived his notions from natural science writers who
        had never studied metaphysics, and in Moscow Levin had had many
        arguments with him of late.
      </p>

      <p>
        And one of these arguments, in which Katavasov had obviously considered
        that he came off victorious, was the first thing Levin thought of as he
        recognized him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, whatever I do, I won&rsquo;t argue and give utterance to my
        ideas lightly,&rdquo; he thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        Getting out of the trap and greeting his brother and Katavasov, Levin
        asked about his wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She has taken Mitya to Kolok&rdquo; (a copse near the house).
        &ldquo;She meant to have him out there because it&rsquo;s so hot
        indoors,&rdquo; said Dolly. Levin had always advised his wife not to
        take the baby to the wood, thinking it unsafe, and he was not pleased to
        hear this.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She rushes about from place to place with him,&rdquo; said the
        prince, smiling. &ldquo;I advised her to try putting him in the ice
        cellar.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She meant to come to the bee-house. She thought you would be
        there. We are going there,&rdquo; said Dolly.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and what are you doing?&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch,
        falling back from the rest and walking beside him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, nothing special. Busy as usual with the land,&rdquo; answered
        Levin. &ldquo;Well, and what about you? Come for long? We have been
        expecting you for such a long time.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Only for a fortnight. I&rsquo;ve a great deal to do in
        Moscow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At these words the brothers&rsquo; eyes met, and Levin, in spite of the
        desire he always had, stronger than ever just now, to be on affectionate
        and still more open terms with his brother, felt an awkwardness in
        looking at him. He dropped his eyes and did not know what to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        Casting over the subjects of conversation that would be pleasant to
        Sergey Ivanovitch, and would keep him off the subject of the Servian war
        and the Slavonic question, at which he had hinted by the allusion to
        what he had to do in Moscow, Levin began to talk of Sergey
        Ivanovitch&rsquo;s book.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, have there been reviews of your book?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch smiled at the intentional character of the question.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No one is interested in that now, and I less than anyone,&rdquo;
        he said. &ldquo;Just look, Darya Alexandrovna, we shall have a
        shower,&rdquo; he added, pointing with a sunshade at the white rain
        clouds that showed above the aspen tree-tops.
      </p>

      <p>
        And these words were enough to re-establish again between the brothers
        that tone&mdash;hardly hostile, but chilly&mdash;which Levin had been so
        longing to avoid.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin went up to Katavasov.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It was jolly of you to make up your mind to come,&rdquo; he said
        to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been meaning to a long while. Now we shall have some
        discussion, we&rsquo;ll see to that. Have you been reading
        Spencer?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve not finished reading him,&rdquo; said Levin.
        &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t need him now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that? that&rsquo;s interesting. Why so?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I mean that I&rsquo;m fully convinced that the solution of the
        problems that interest me I shall never find in him and his like.
        Now....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But Katavasov&rsquo;s serene and good-humored expression suddenly struck
        him, and he felt such tenderness for his own happy mood, which he was
        unmistakably disturbing by this conversation, that he remembered his
        resolution and stopped short.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll talk later on,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;If
        we&rsquo;re going to the bee-house, it&rsquo;s this way, along this
        little path,&rdquo; he said, addressing them all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going along the narrow path to a little uncut meadow covered on one side
        with thick clumps of brilliant heart&rsquo;s-ease among which stood up
        here and there tall, dark green tufts of hellebore, Levin settled his
        guests in the dense, cool shade of the young aspens on a bench and some
        stumps purposely put there for visitors to the bee-house who might be
        afraid of the bees, and he went off himself to the hut to get bread,
        cucumbers, and fresh honey, to regale them with.
      </p>

      <p>
        Trying to make his movements as deliberate as possible, and listening to
        the bees that buzzed more and more frequently past him, he walked along
        the little path to the hut. In the very entry one bee hummed angrily,
        caught in his beard, but he carefully extricated it. Going into the
        shady outer room, he took down from the wall his veil, that hung on a
        peg, and putting it on, and thrusting his hands into his pockets, he
        went into the fenced-in bee-garden, where there stood in the midst of a
        closely mown space in regular rows, fastened with bast on posts, all the
        hives he knew so well, the old stocks, each with its own history, and
        along the fences the younger swarms hived that year. In front of the
        openings of the hives, it made his eyes giddy to watch the bees and
        drones whirling round and round about the same spot, while among them
        the working bees flew in and out with spoils or in search of them,
        always in the same direction into the wood to the flowering lime trees
        and back to the hives.
      </p>

      <p>
        His ears were filled with the incessant hum in various notes, now the
        busy hum of the working bee flying quickly off, then the blaring of the
        lazy drone, and the excited buzz of the bees on guard protecting their
        property from the enemy and preparing to sting. On the farther side of
        the fence the old bee-keeper was shaving a hoop for a tub, and he did
        not see Levin. Levin stood still in the midst of the beehives and did
        not call him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was glad of a chance to be alone to recover from the influence of
        ordinary actual life, which had already depressed his happy mood. He
        thought that he had already had time to lose his temper with Ivan, to
        show coolness to his brother, and to talk flippantly with Katavasov.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Can it have been only a momentary mood, and will it pass and
        leave no trace?&rdquo; he thought. But the same instant, going back to
        his mood, he felt with delight that something new and important had
        happened to him. Real life had only for a time overcast the spiritual
        peace he had found, but it was still untouched within him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as the bees, whirling round him, now menacing him and distracting
        his attention, prevented him from enjoying complete physical peace,
        forced him to restrain his movements to avoid them, so had the petty
        cares that had swarmed about him from the moment he got into the trap
        restricted his spiritual freedom; but that lasted only so long as he was
        among them. Just as his bodily strength was still unaffected, in spite
        of the bees, so too was the spiritual strength that he had just become
        aware of.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 15</h3>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know, Kostya, with whom Sergey Ivanovitch traveled on his
        way here?&rdquo; said Dolly, doling out cucumbers and honey to the
        children; &ldquo;with Vronsky! He&rsquo;s going to Servia.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And not alone; he&rsquo;s taking a squadron out with him at his
        own expense,&rdquo; said Katavasov.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the right thing for him,&rdquo; said Levin.
        &ldquo;Are volunteers still going out then?&rdquo; he added, glancing at
        Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch did not answer. He was carefully with a blunt knife
        getting a live bee covered with sticky honey out of a cup full of white
        honeycomb.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I should think so! You should have seen what was going on at the
        station yesterday!&rdquo; said Katavasov, biting with a juicy sound into
        a cucumber.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what is one to make of it? For mercy&rsquo;s sake, do
        explain to me, Sergey Ivanovitch, where are all those volunteers going,
        whom are they fighting with?&rdquo; asked the old prince, unmistakably
        taking up a conversation that had sprung up in Levin&rsquo;s absence.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;With the Turks,&rdquo; Sergey Ivanovitch answered, smiling
        serenely, as he extricated the bee, dark with honey and helplessly
        kicking, and put it with the knife on a stout aspen leaf.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But who has declared war on the Turks?&mdash;Ivan Ivanovitch
        Ragozov and Countess Lidia Ivanovna, assisted by Madame Stahl?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No one has declared war, but people sympathize with their
        neighbors&rsquo; sufferings and are eager to help them,&rdquo; said
        Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But the prince is not speaking of help,&rdquo; said Levin, coming
        to the assistance of his father-in-law, &ldquo;but of war. The prince
        says that private persons cannot take part in war without the permission
        of the government.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kostya, mind, that&rsquo;s a bee! Really, they&rsquo;ll sting
        us!&rdquo; said Dolly, waving away a wasp.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not a bee, it&rsquo;s a wasp,&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well now, well, what&rsquo;s your own theory?&rdquo; Katavasov
        said to Levin with a smile, distinctly challenging him to a discussion.
        &ldquo;Why have not private persons the right to do so?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, my theory&rsquo;s this: war is on one side such a beastly,
        cruel, and awful thing, that no one man, not to speak of a Christian,
        can individually take upon himself the responsibility of beginning wars;
        that can only be done by a government, which is called upon to do this,
        and is driven inevitably into war. On the other hand, both political
        science and common sense teach us that in matters of state, and
        especially in the matter of war, private citizens must forego their
        personal individual will.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had their replies ready, and both began
        speaking at the same time.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But the point is, my dear fellow, that there may be cases when
        the government does not carry out the will of the citizens and then the
        public asserts its will,&rdquo; said Katavasov.
      </p>

      <p>
        But evidently Sergey Ivanovitch did not approve of this answer. His
        brows contracted at Katavasov&rsquo;s words and he said something else.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t put the matter in its true light. There is no
        question here of a declaration of war, but simply the expression of a
        human Christian feeling. Our brothers, one with us in religion and in
        race, are being massacred. Even supposing they were not our brothers nor
        fellow-Christians, but simply children, women, old people, feeling is
        aroused and Russians go eagerly to help in stopping these atrocities.
        Fancy, if you were going along the street and saw drunken men beating a
        woman or a child&mdash;I imagine you would not stop to inquire whether
        war had been declared on the men, but would throw yourself on them, and
        protect the victim.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But I should not kill them,&rdquo; said Levin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you would kill them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. If I saw that, I might give way to my impulse
        of the moment, but I can&rsquo;t say beforehand. And such a momentary
        impulse there is not, and there cannot be, in the case of the oppression
        of the Slavonic peoples.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Possibly for you there is not; but for others there is,&rdquo;
        said Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning with displeasure. &ldquo;There are
        traditions still extant among the people of Slavs of the true faith
        suffering under the yoke of the &lsquo;unclean sons of Hagar.&rsquo; The
        people have heard of the sufferings of their brethren and have
        spoken.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said Levin evasively; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
        see it. I&rsquo;m one of the people myself, and I don&rsquo;t feel
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here am I too,&rdquo; said the old prince. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
        staying abroad and reading the papers, and I must own, up to the time of
        the Bulgarian atrocities, I couldn&rsquo;t make out why it was all the
        Russians were all of a sudden so fond of their Slavonic brethren, while
        I didn&rsquo;t feel the slightest affection for them. I was very much
        upset, thought I was a monster, or that it was the influence of Carlsbad
        on me. But since I have been here, my mind&rsquo;s been set at rest. I
        see that there are people besides me who&rsquo;re only interested in
        Russia, and not in their Slavonic brethren. Here&rsquo;s Konstantin
        too.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Personal opinions mean nothing in such a case,&rdquo; said Sergey
        Ivanovitch; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a matter of personal opinions when all
        Russia&mdash;the whole people&mdash;has expressed its will.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But excuse me, I don&rsquo;t see that. The people don&rsquo;t
        know anything about it, if you come to that,&rdquo; said the old prince.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, papa!... how can you say that? And last Sunday in
        church?&rdquo; said Dolly, listening to the conversation. &ldquo;Please
        give me a cloth,&rdquo; she said to the old man, who was looking at the
        children with a smile. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s not possible that
        all....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But what was it in church on Sunday? The priest had been told to
        read that. He read it. They didn&rsquo;t understand a word of it. Then
        they were told that there was to be a collection for a pious object in
        church; well, they pulled out their halfpence and gave them, but what
        for they couldn&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The people cannot help knowing; the sense of their own destinies
        is always in the people, and at such moments as the present that sense
        finds utterance,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch with conviction, glancing
        at the old bee-keeper.
      </p>

      <p>
        The handsome old man, with black grizzled beard and thick silvery hair,
        stood motionless, holding a cup of honey, looking down from the height
        of his tall figure with friendly serenity at the gentlefolk, obviously
        understanding nothing of their conversation and not caring to understand
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, no doubt,&rdquo; he said, with a significant
        shake of his head at Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s words.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here, then, ask him. He knows nothing about it and thinks
        nothing,&rdquo; said Levin. &ldquo;Have you heard about the war,
        Mihalitch?&rdquo; he said, turning to him. &ldquo;What they read in the
        church? What do you think about it? Ought we to fight for the
        Christians?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What should we think? Alexander Nikolaevitch our Emperor has
        thought for us; he thinks for us indeed in all things. It&rsquo;s
        clearer for him to see. Shall I bring a bit more bread? Give the little
        lad some more?&rdquo; he said addressing Darya Alexandrovna and pointing
        to Grisha, who had finished his crust.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to ask,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch,
        &ldquo;we have seen and are seeing hundreds and hundreds of people who
        give up everything to serve a just cause, come from every part of
        Russia, and directly and clearly express their thought and aim. They
        bring their halfpence or go themselves and say directly what for. What
        does it mean?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It means, to my thinking,&rdquo; said Levin, who was beginning to
        get warm, &ldquo;that among eighty millions of people there can always
        be found not hundreds, as now, but tens of thousands of people who have
        lost caste, ne&rsquo;er-do-wells, who are always ready to go
        anywhere&mdash;to Pogatchev&rsquo;s bands, to Khiva, to
        Servia....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you that it&rsquo;s not a case of hundreds or of
        ne&rsquo;er-do-wells, but the best representatives of the people!&rdquo;
        said Sergey Ivanovitch, with as much irritation as if he were defending
        the last penny of his fortune. &ldquo;And what of the subscriptions? In
        this case it is a whole people directly expressing their will.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That word &lsquo;people&rsquo; is so vague,&rdquo; said Levin.
        &ldquo;Parish clerks, teachers, and one in a thousand of the peasants,
        maybe, know what it&rsquo;s all about. The rest of the eighty millions,
        like Mihalitch, far from expressing their will, haven&rsquo;t the
        faintest idea what there is for them to express their will about. What
        right have we to say that this is the people&rsquo;s will?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 16</h3>

      <p>
        Sergey Ivanovitch, being practiced in argument, did not reply, but at
        once turned the conversation to another aspect of the subject.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, if you want to learn the spirit of the people by arithmetical
        computation, of course it&rsquo;s very difficult to arrive at it. And
        voting has not been introduced among us and cannot be introduced, for it
        does not express the will of the people; but there are other ways of
        reaching that. It is felt in the air, it is felt by the heart. I
        won&rsquo;t speak of those deep currents which are astir in the still
        ocean of the people, and which are evident to every unprejudiced man;
        let us look at society in the narrow sense. All the most diverse
        sections of the educated public, hostile before, are merged in one.
        Every division is at an end, all the public organs say the same thing
        over and over again, all feel the mighty torrent that has overtaken them
        and is carrying them in one direction.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, all the newspapers do say the same thing,&rdquo; said the
        prince. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. But so it is the same thing that all
        the frogs croak before a storm. One can hear nothing for them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Frogs or no frogs, I&rsquo;m not the editor of a paper and I
        don&rsquo;t want to defend them; but I am speaking of the unanimity in
        the intellectual world,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch, addressing his
        brother. Levin would have answered, but the old prince interrupted him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, about that unanimity, that&rsquo;s another thing, one may
        say,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my son-in-law, Stepan
        Arkadyevitch, you know him. He&rsquo;s got a place now on the committee
        of a commission and something or other, I don&rsquo;t remember. Only
        there&rsquo;s nothing to do in it&mdash;why, Dolly, it&rsquo;s no
        secret!&mdash;and a salary of eight thousand. You try asking him whether
        his post is of use, he&rsquo;ll prove to you that it&rsquo;s most
        necessary. And he&rsquo;s a truthful man too, but there&rsquo;s no
        refusing to believe in the utility of eight thousand roubles.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, he asked me to give a message to Darya Alexandrovna about
        the post,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch reluctantly, feeling the
        prince&rsquo;s remark to be ill-timed.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So it is with the unanimity of the press. That&rsquo;s been
        explained to me: as soon as there&rsquo;s war their incomes are doubled.
        How can they help believing in the destinies of the people and the
        Slavonic races ... and all that?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for many of the papers, but that&rsquo;s
        unjust,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I would only make one condition,&rdquo; pursued the old prince.
        &ldquo;Alphonse Karr said a capital thing before the war with Prussia:
        &lsquo;You consider war to be inevitable? Very good. Let everyone who
        advocates war be enrolled in a special regiment of advance-guards, for
        the front of every storm, of every attack, to lead them
        all!&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A nice lot the editors would make!&rdquo; said Katavasov, with a
        loud roar, as he pictured the editors he knew in this picked legion.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But they&rsquo;d run,&rdquo; said Dolly, &ldquo;they&rsquo;d only
        be in the way.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, if they ran away, then we&rsquo;d have grape-shot or Cossacks
        with whips behind them,&rdquo; said the prince.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a joke, and a poor one too, if you&rsquo;ll
        excuse my saying so, prince,&rdquo; said Sergey Ivanovitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that it was a joke, that....&rdquo; Levin was
        beginning, but Sergey Ivanovitch interrupted him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Every member of society is called upon to do his own special
        work,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And men of thought are doing their work
        when they express public opinion. And the single-hearted and full
        expression of public opinion is the service of the press and a
        phenomenon to rejoice us at the same time. Twenty years ago we should
        have been silent, but now we have heard the voice of the Russian people,
        which is ready to rise as one man and ready to sacrifice itself for its
        oppressed brethren; that is a great step and a proof of strength.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not only making a sacrifice, but killing
        Turks,&rdquo; said Levin timidly. &ldquo;The people make sacrifices and
        are ready to make sacrifices for their soul, but not for murder,&rdquo;
        he added, instinctively connecting the conversation with the ideas that
        had been absorbing his mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For their soul? That&rsquo;s a most puzzling expression for a
        natural science man, do you understand? What sort of thing is the
        soul?&rdquo; said Katavasov, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, you know!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, by God, I haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea!&rdquo; said
        Katavasov with a loud roar of laughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I bring not peace, but a sword,&rsquo; says Christ,&rdquo;
        Sergey Ivanovitch rejoined for his part, quoting as simply as though it
        were the easiest thing to understand the very passage that had always
        puzzled Levin most.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, no doubt,&rdquo; the old man repeated again. He
        was standing near them and responded to a chance glance turned in his
        direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, my dear fellow, you&rsquo;re defeated, utterly
        defeated!&rdquo; cried Katavasov good-humoredly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin reddened with vexation, not at being defeated, but at having
        failed to control himself and being drawn into argument.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t argue with them,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;they
        wear impenetrable armor, while I&rsquo;m naked.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He saw that it was impossible to convince his brother and Katavasov, and
        he saw even less possibility of himself agreeing with them. What they
        advocated was the very pride of intellect that had almost been his ruin.
        He could not admit that some dozens of men, among them his brother, had
        the right, on the ground of what they were told by some hundreds of glib
        volunteers swarming to the capital, to say that they and the newspapers
        were expressing the will and feeling of the people, and a feeling which
        was expressed in vengeance and murder. He could not admit this, because
        he neither saw the expression of such feelings in the people among whom
        he was living, nor found them in himself (and he could not but consider
        himself one of the persons making up the Russian people), and most of
        all because he, like the people, did not know and could not know what is
        for the general good, though he knew beyond a doubt that this general
        good could be attained only by the strict observance of that law of
        right and wrong which has been revealed to every man, and therefore he
        could not wish for war or advocate war for any general objects whatever.
        He said as Mihalitch did and the people, who had expressed their feeling
        in the traditional invitations of the Varyagi: &ldquo;Be princes and
        rule over us. Gladly we promise complete submission. All the labor, all
        humiliations, all sacrifices we take upon ourselves; but we will not
        judge and decide.&rdquo; And now, according to Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s
        account, the people had foregone this privilege they had bought at such
        a costly price.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wanted to say too that if public opinion were an infallible guide,
        then why were not revolutions and the commune as lawful as the movement
        in favor of the Slavonic peoples? But these were merely thoughts that
        could settle nothing. One thing could be seen beyond doubt&mdash;that
        was that at the actual moment the discussion was irritating Sergey
        Ivanovitch, and so it was wrong to continue it. And Levin ceased
        speaking and then called the attention of his guests to the fact that
        the storm clouds were gathering, and that they had better be going home
        before it rained.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 17</h3>

      <p>
        The old prince and Sergey Ivanovitch got into the trap and drove off;
        the rest of the party hastened homewards on foot.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the storm-clouds, turning white and then black, moved down so
        quickly that they had to quicken their pace to get home before the rain.
        The foremost clouds, lowering and black as soot-laden smoke, rushed with
        extraordinary swiftness over the sky. They were still two hundred paces
        from home and a gust of wind had already blown up, and every second the
        downpour might be looked for.
      </p>

      <p>
        The children ran ahead with frightened and gleeful shrieks. Darya
        Alexandrovna, struggling painfully with her skirts that clung round her
        legs, was not walking, but running, her eyes fixed on the children. The
        men of the party, holding their hats on, strode with long steps beside
        her. They were just at the steps when a big drop fell splashing on the
        edge of the iron guttering. The children and their elders after them ran
        into the shelter of the house, talking merrily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Katerina Alexandrovna?&rdquo; Levin asked of Agafea Mihalovna,
        who met them with kerchiefs and rugs in the hall.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We thought she was with you,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And Mitya?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In the copse, he must be, and the nurse with him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Levin snatched up the rugs and ran towards the copse.
      </p>

      <p>
        In that brief interval of time the storm clouds had moved on, covering
        the sun so completely that it was dark as an eclipse. Stubbornly, as
        though insisting on its rights, the wind stopped Levin, and tearing the
        leaves and flowers off the lime trees and stripping the white birch
        branches into strange unseemly nakedness, it twisted everything on one
        side&mdash;acacias, flowers, burdocks, long grass, and tall tree-tops.
        The peasant girls working in the garden ran shrieking into shelter in
        the servants&rsquo; quarters. The streaming rain had already flung its
        white veil over all the distant forest and half the fields close by, and
        was rapidly swooping down upon the copse. The wet of the rain spurting
        up in tiny drops could be smelt in the air.
      </p>

      <p>
        Holding his head bent down before him, and struggling with the wind that
        strove to tear the wraps away from him, Levin was moving up to the copse
        and had just caught sight of something white behind the oak tree, when
        there was a sudden flash, the whole earth seemed on fire, and the vault
        of heaven seemed crashing overhead. Opening his blinded eyes, Levin
        gazed through the thick veil of rain that separated him now from the
        copse, and to his horror the first thing he saw was the green crest of
        the familiar oak-tree in the middle of the copse uncannily changing its
        position. &ldquo;Can it have been struck?&rdquo; Levin hardly had time
        to think when, moving more and more rapidly, the oak tree vanished
        behind the other trees, and he heard the crash of the great tree falling
        upon the others.
      </p>

      <p>
        The flash of lightning, the crash of thunder, and the instantaneous
        chill that ran through him were all merged for Levin in one sense of
        terror.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My God! my God! not on them!&rdquo; he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        And though he thought at once how senseless was his prayer that they
        should not have been killed by the oak which had fallen now, he repeated
        it, knowing that he could do nothing better than utter this senseless
        prayer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Running up to the place where they usually went, he did not find them
        there.
      </p>

      <p>
        They were at the other end of the copse under an old lime-tree; they
        were calling him. Two figures in dark dresses (they had been light
        summer dresses when they started out) were standing bending over
        something. It was Kitty with the nurse. The rain was already ceasing,
        and it was beginning to get light when Levin reached them. The nurse was
        not wet on the lower part of her dress, but Kitty was drenched through,
        and her soaked clothes clung to her. Though the rain was over, they
        still stood in the same position in which they had been standing when
        the storm broke. Both stood bending over a perambulator with a green
        umbrella.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alive? Unhurt? Thank God!&rdquo; he said, splashing with his
        soaked boots through the standing water and running up to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty&rsquo;s rosy wet face was turned towards him, and she smiled
        timidly under her shapeless sopped hat.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself? I can&rsquo;t think how you
        can be so reckless!&rdquo; he said angrily to his wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t my fault, really. We were just meaning to go,
        when he made such a to-do that we had to change him. We were
        just....&rdquo; Kitty began defending herself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mitya was unharmed, dry, and still fast asleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, thank God! I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m saying!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        They gathered up the baby&rsquo;s wet belongings; the nurse picked up
        the baby and carried it. Levin walked beside his wife, and, penitent for
        having been angry, he squeezed her hand when the nurse was not looking.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 18</h3>

      <p>
        During the whole of that day, in the extremely different conversations
        in which he took part, only as it were with the top layer of his mind,
        in spite of the disappointment of not finding the change he expected in
        himself, Levin had been all the while joyfully conscious of the fulness
        of his heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the rain it was too wet to go for a walk; besides, the storm
        clouds still hung about the horizon, and gathered here and there, black
        and thundery, on the rim of the sky. The whole party spent the rest of
        the day in the house.
      </p>

      <p>
        No more discussions sprang up; on the contrary, after dinner everyone
        was in the most amiable frame of mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first Katavasov amused the ladies by his original jokes, which always
        pleased people on their first acquaintance with him. Then Sergey
        Ivanovitch induced him to tell them about the very interesting
        observations he had made on the habits and characteristics of common
        houseflies, and their life. Sergey Ivanovitch, too, was in good spirits,
        and at tea his brother drew him on to explain his views of the future of
        the Eastern question, and he spoke so simply and so well, that everyone
        listened eagerly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty was the only one who did not hear it all&mdash;she was summoned to
        give Mitya his bath.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few minutes after Kitty had left the room she sent for Levin to come
        to the nursery.
      </p>

      <p>
        Leaving his tea, and regretfully interrupting the interesting
        conversation, and at the same time uneasily wondering why he had been
        sent for, as this only happened on important occasions, Levin went to
        the nursery.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although he had been much interested by Sergey Ivanovitch&rsquo;s views
        of the new epoch in history that would be created by the emancipation of
        forty millions of men of Slavonic race acting with Russia, a conception
        quite new to him, and although he was disturbed by uneasy wonder at
        being sent for by Kitty, as soon as he came out of the drawing-room and
        was alone, his mind reverted at once to the thoughts of the morning. And
        all the theories of the significance of the Slav element in the history
        of the world seemed to him so trivial compared with what was passing in
        his own soul, that he instantly forgot it all and dropped back into the
        same frame of mind that he had been in that morning.
      </p>

      <p>
        He did not, as he had done at other times, recall the whole train of
        thought&mdash;that he did not need. He fell back at once into the
        feeling which had guided him, which was connected with those thoughts,
        and he found that feeling in his soul even stronger and more definite
        than before. He did not, as he had had to do with previous attempts to
        find comforting arguments, need to revive a whole chain of thought to
        find the feeling. Now, on the contrary, the feeling of joy and peace was
        keener than ever, and thought could not keep pace with feeling.
      </p>

      <p>
        He walked across the terrace and looked at two stars that had come out
        in the darkening sky, and suddenly he remembered. &ldquo;Yes, looking at
        the sky, I thought that the dome that I see is not a deception, and then
        I thought something, I shirked facing something,&rdquo; he mused.
        &ldquo;But whatever it was, there can be no disproving it! I have but to
        think, and all will come clear!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he was going into the nursery he remembered what it was he had
        shirked facing. It was that if the chief proof of the Divinity was His
        revelation of what is right, how is it this revelation is confined to
        the Christian church alone? What relation to this revelation have the
        beliefs of the Buddhists, Mohammedans, who preached and did good too?
      </p>

      <p>
        It seemed to him that he had an answer to this question; but he had not
        time to formulate it to himself before he went into the nursery.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty was standing with her sleeves tucked up over the baby in the bath.
        Hearing her husband&rsquo;s footstep, she turned towards him, summoning
        him to her with her smile. With one hand she was supporting the fat baby
        that lay floating and sprawling on its back, while with the other she
        squeezed the sponge over him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, look, look!&rdquo; she said, when her husband came up to
        her. &ldquo;Agafea Mihalovna&rsquo;s right. He knows us!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Mitya had on that day given unmistakable, incontestable signs of
        recognizing all his friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as Levin approached the bath, the experiment was tried, and it
        was completely successful. The cook, sent for with this object, bent
        over the baby. He frowned and shook his head disapprovingly. Kitty bent
        down to him, he gave her a beaming smile, propped his little hands on
        the sponge and chirruped, making such a queer little contented sound
        with his lips, that Kitty and the nurse were not alone in their
        admiration. Levin, too, was surprised and delighted.
      </p>

      <p>
        The baby was taken out of the bath, drenched with water, wrapped in
        towels, dried, and after a piercing scream, handed to his mother.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I am glad you are beginning to love him,&rdquo; said Kitty
        to her husband, when she had settled herself comfortably in her usual
        place, with the baby at her breast. &ldquo;I am so glad! It had begun to
        distress me. You said you had no feeling for him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No; did I say that? I only said I was disappointed.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What! disappointed in him?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Not disappointed in him, but in my own feeling; I had expected
        more. I had expected a rush of new delightful emotion to come as a
        surprise. And then instead of that&mdash;disgust, pity....&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        She listened attentively, looking at him over the baby, while she put
        back on her slender fingers the rings she had taken off while giving
        Mitya his bath.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And most of all, at there being far more apprehension and pity
        than pleasure. Today, after that fright during the storm, I understand
        how I love him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kitty&rsquo;s smile was radiant.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Were you very much frightened?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So was I
        too, but I feel it more now that it&rsquo;s over. I&rsquo;m going to
        look at the oak. How nice Katavasov is! And what a happy day we&rsquo;ve
        had altogether. And you&rsquo;re so nice with Sergey Ivanovitch, when
        you care to be.... Well, go back to them. It&rsquo;s always so hot and
        steamy here after the bath.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 19</h3>

      <p>
        Going out of the nursery and being again alone, Levin went back at once
        to the thought, in which there was something not clear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of going into the drawing-room, where he heard voices, he
        stopped on the terrace, and leaning his elbows on the parapet, he gazed
        up at the sky.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was quite dark now, and in the south, where he was looking, there
        were no clouds. The storm had drifted on to the opposite side of the
        sky, and there were flashes of lightning and distant thunder from that
        quarter. Levin listened to the monotonous drip from the lime trees in
        the garden, and looked at the triangle of stars he knew so well, and the
        Milky Way with its branches that ran through its midst. At each flash of
        lightning the Milky Way, and even the bright stars, vanished, but as
        soon as the lightning died away, they reappeared in their places as
        though some hand had flung them back with careful aim.

        &ldquo;Well, what is it perplexes me?&rdquo; Levin said to himself,
        feeling beforehand that the solution of his difficulties was ready in
        his soul, though he did not know it yet. &ldquo;Yes, the one
        unmistakable, incontestable manifestation of the Divinity is the law of
        right and wrong, which has come into the world by revelation, and which
        I feel in myself, and in the recognition of which&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
        make myself, but whether I will or not&mdash;I am made one with other
        men in one body of believers, which is called the church. Well, but the
        Jews, the Mohammedans, the Confucians, the Buddhists&mdash;what of
        them?&rdquo; he put to himself the question he had feared to face.
        &ldquo;Can these hundreds of millions of men be deprived of that highest
        blessing without which life has no meaning?&rdquo; He pondered a moment,
        but immediately corrected himself. &ldquo;But what am I
        questioning?&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I am questioning the
        relation to Divinity of all the different religions of all mankind. I am
        questioning the universal manifestation of God to all the world with all
        those misty blurs. What am I about? To me individually, to my heart has
        been revealed a knowledge beyond all doubt, and unattainable by reason,
        and here I am obstinately trying to express that knowledge in reason and
        words.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know that the stars don&rsquo;t move?&rdquo; he
        asked himself, gazing at the bright planet which had shifted its
        position up to the topmost twig of the birch-tree. &ldquo;But looking at
        the movements of the stars, I can&rsquo;t picture to myself the rotation
        of the earth, and I&rsquo;m right in saying that the stars move.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And could the astronomers have understood and calculated
        anything, if they had taken into account all the complicated and varied
        motions of the earth? All the marvelous conclusions they have reached
        about the distances, weights, movements, and deflections of the heavenly
        bodies are only founded on the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies
        about a stationary earth, on that very motion I see before me now, which
        has been so for millions of men during long ages, and was and will be
        always alike, and can always be trusted. And just as the conclusions of
        the astronomers would have been vain and uncertain if not founded on
        observations of the seen heavens, in relation to a single meridian and a
        single horizon, so would my conclusions be vain and uncertain if not
        founded on that conception of right, which has been and will be always
        alike for all men, which has been revealed to me as a Christian, and
        which can always be trusted in my soul. The question of other religions
        and their relations to Divinity I have no right to decide, and no
        possibility of deciding.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, you haven&rsquo;t gone in then?&rdquo; he heard Kitty&rsquo;s
        voice all at once, as she came by the same way to the drawing-room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it? you&rsquo;re not worried about anything?&rdquo; she
        said, looking intently at his face in the starlight.
      </p>

      <p>
        But she could not have seen his face if a flash of lightning had not
        hidden the stars and revealed it. In that flash she saw his face
        distinctly, and seeing him calm and happy, she smiled at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She understands,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;she knows what
        I&rsquo;m thinking about. Shall I tell her or not? Yes, I&rsquo;ll tell
        her.&rdquo; But at the moment he was about to speak, she began speaking.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kostya! do something for me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;go into the
        corner room and see if they&rsquo;ve made it all right for Sergey
        Ivanovitch. I can&rsquo;t very well. See if they&rsquo;ve put the new
        wash stand in it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll go directly,&rdquo; said Levin, standing up
        and kissing her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d better not speak of it,&rdquo; he thought, when she
        had gone in before him. &ldquo;It is a secret for me alone, of vital
        importance for me, and not to be put into words.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This new feeling has not changed me, has not made me happy and
        enlightened all of a sudden, as I had dreamed, just like the feeling for
        my child. There was no surprise in this either. Faith&mdash;or not
        faith&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what it is&mdash;but this feeling has
        come just as imperceptibly through suffering, and has taken firm root in
        my soul.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall go on in the same way, losing my temper with Ivan the
        coachman, falling into angry discussions, expressing my opinions
        tactlessly; there will be still the same wall between the holy of holies
        of my soul and other people, even my wife; I shall still go on scolding
        her for my own terror, and being remorseful for it; I shall still be as
        unable to understand with my reason why I pray, and I shall still go on
        praying; but my life now, my whole life apart from anything that can
        happen to me, every minute of it is no more meaningless, as it was
        before, but it has the positive meaning of goodness, which I have the
        power to put into it.&rdquo;
      </p>

    "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed,
    viewed, copied or distributed: This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere
    in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with
    almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
    it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook
    or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the United States,
    you'll have to check the laws of the country where you are located before
    using this ebook. 1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
    work is derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
    contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
    copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the
    United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are redistributing
    or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated

    and distribute this work in any binary, compressed, marked up,

    from the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method you
    already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to the owner
    of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has agreed to donate royalties
    under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.
    Royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which
    you prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns.
    Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4,
    "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
    Foundation." * You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who
    notifies you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
    does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm License. You
    must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works
    possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to
    other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm works. * You provide, in accordance
    with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any money paid for a work or a
    replacement copy, if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and
    reported to you within 90 days of receipt of the work. * You comply with all
    other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
    works. 1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
    Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are
    set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both
    the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The Project Gutenberg
    Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the
    Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below. 1.F. 1.F.1. Project Gutenberg
    volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do
    copyright research on, transcribe and proofread works not protected by U.S.
    copyright law in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these
    efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on which they
    may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to,
    incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or
    other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
    other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be
    read by your equipment. 1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES -
    Except for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph
    1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the
    Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
    Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to
    you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT
    YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR
    BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT
    THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS
    AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT,
    CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. 1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND -
    If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving
    it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by
    sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from. If
    you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
    your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the
    defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund.
    If you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it
    to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work
    electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective,
    you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the
    problem. 1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set
    forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
    OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE. 1.F.5. Some
    states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the
    exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or
    limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state
    applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the
    maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The
    invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not
    void the remaining provisions. 1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and
    hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the
    Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
    in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
    production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
    works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal
    fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you
    do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
    work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project
    Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause. Section 2. Information
    about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous
    with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the
    widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new
    computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and
    donations from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support
    to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching
    Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm
    collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001,
    the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a
    secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
    To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and
    how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
    Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information

    corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted
    tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or
    federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the

    Foundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact For
    additional contact information: Dr. Gregory B. Newby Chief Executive and
    Director gbnewby@pglaf.org Section 4. Information about Donations to the
    Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg-tm depends
    upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to
    carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed
    works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by
    the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small
    donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax
    exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with
    the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of
    the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
    considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with
    these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have
    not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
    determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
    www.gutenberg.org/donate While we cannot and do not solicit contributions
    from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of
    no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such
    states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are
    gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax
    treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws
    alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages
    for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a
    number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card
    donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate Section 5.
    General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Professor
    Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a
    library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
    forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with
    only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are
    often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as
    not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is
    included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any
    particular paper edition. Most people start at our Web site which has the
    main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org This Web site includes
    information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to
    the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our
    new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new
    eBooks.
