  ([#112](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/112)).

- Update icon for applying deferred annotation updates
  ([#113](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/113)).

- Count deleted annotations as pending updates
  ([#114](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/114)).

### Fixed

- Fix off-screen empty, unsaved annotations not being removed when a new
  annotation is created ([#107](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/107)).

- Fix off-screen unsaved annotations not being moved to new group when focused
  group is changed ([#108](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/108)).

- Only count updates to annotations in the focused group as pending updates
  ([#111](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/111)).

## [0.43.0] - 2016-09-15

### Added

- Behind the `defer_realtime_updates` flag, add the ability to accumulate
  "real-time" changes and display a button notifying users of new activity,
  rather than automatically applying these changes to their view. This should
  result in a less jumpy experience for users on heavily-annotated documents.
  ([#106](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/106)).

## [0.42.0] - 2016-09-13

### Changed

- Only offer 'Newest' and 'Oldest' sort orders when Page Notes tab is selected
  and sort Page Notes from oldest to newest by default
  ([#99](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/99)).

- Sort unsaved annotations more predictably
  ([#101](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/101)).

## [0.41.0] - 2016-09-12

### Fixed

- Fix behavior when there are multiple unsaved annotations
  ([#95](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/95)).

## [0.40.0] - 2016-09-09

### Changed

- When retrieving an API token, the client now sends the CSRF token in a header
  rather than in a GET request parameter
  ([#91](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/91)).

## [0.39.0] - 2016-09-06

### Changed

- In browsers that support it, the adder is now isolated from the styling of the
  annotated page using Shadow DOM
  ([#49](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/49)).

- The selected tab (annotations/page notes/orphans) is now preserved when
  changing groups ([#82](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/82)).

### Fixed

- Fix an issue where annotations updated via the websocket would unanchor,
  causing disturbance for anyone trying to annotate on the same page
  ([#87](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/87),
  [#88](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/88)).

## [0.38.1] - 2016-08-09

### Fixed

- Fix display of annotations on stream with orphans flag enabled
  ([#76](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/76)).

- Feature-flag orphan quote strikethrough on annotation cards
  ([#77](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/77)).

## [0.38.0] - 2016-08-08

### Fixed

- If an annotation is loaded and then quickly removed before the anchoring
  timeout expires, do not attempt to modify it's orphan status
  ([#75](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/75)).

## [0.37.0] - 2016-08-08

### Added

- Display annotations that cannot be anchored in the page in a separate Orphans
  tab and strike-through their quotes in annotation cards
  ([#52](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/52)). Feature flag:
  "orphans_tab"

- The Hypothesis client version is now embedded in the built package, rather
  than requiring the hosting service to provide it
  ([#65](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/65)).

### Changed

- Replace `firstRun` config option with more usefully named `openSidebar` and
  `openLoginForm` config options
  ([#63](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/63)).

- Update the URLs in the Hypothesis service used by 'Sign up' and 'Forgot
  password' links ([#68](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/68)).

- Enable the selection tabs feature for all users.
  ([#71](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/71)).

- If an annotation fails to anchor within 500ms, mark it as an orphan. If it turns out
  that anchoring just took longer, it will move from the Orphans tab to the Annotations tab
  once anchoring completes.
  ([#72](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/72)).

## [0.36.0] - 2016-07-27

## [0.35.0] - 2016-07-22

### Changed

- Defer connecting to the Hypothesis service's WebSocket endpoint for push
  updates until the user is either logged in or explicitly interacts with the
  sidebar. This reduces load on the service
  ([#20](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/20))

- Move the root UI layout for the sidebar app into the client. This makes it
  easier to serve the client from a web service or bundle it with a browser
  extension ([#37](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/37))

## [0.34.0] - 2016-07-15

### Changed

- Annotation / Notes tabs copy update and style tweaks
  ([#34](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/34))

### Fixed

- Remove sticky tab bar behavior for now because it has some UI issues that
  need to be resolved ([#35](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/35))

- Update UI state after search API request completes with no results
  ([#36](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/36))

## [0.33.0] - 2016-07-13

### Added

- Allow keyboard control of the annotations/notes tabs
  ([#29](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/29))

  ([#24](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/24))

  annotation pages ([#24](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/24))

## [0.32.0] - 2016-07-08

- Make document titles link to annotations in context on the /stream page
  ([#1](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/1))

  ([#18](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/18))

- The Hypothesis client has been separated from the Hypothesis web service and
  moved to its own repository.

### Fixed

- Fix issue where clicking a new annotation in the page that was not yet
  created on the server would display a 'You do not have permission' message
  ([#2](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/2))

- Fix edits to annotations not being preserved when scrolling annotations out
  of view and back into view and not being reflected when searching after
  editing ([#7](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/7),
  [#8](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/8))

- Fix new annotations not being moved to current group when switching groups
  ([#7](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/8))

- Fix replies being moved to newly selected group when switching groups
  ([#8](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/13))

- Fix canceled annotations re-appearing after switching groups
  ([#7](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/8))

- Fix 'AnnotationResource is not a constructor' error when creating annotations
  whilst the app is loading ([#4](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/4))
