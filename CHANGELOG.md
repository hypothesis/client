  rather than in a GET request parameter
  ([#91](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/91)).

## [0.39.0] - 2016-09-06

- In browsers that support it, the adder is now isolated from the styling of the
  annotated page using Shadow DOM
  ([#49](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/49)).

- The selected tab (annotations/page notes/orphans) is now preserved when
  changing groups ([#82](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/82)).

  ([#76](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/76)).

  `openLoginForm` config options
  ([#63](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/63)).

- Update the URLs in the Hypothesis service used by 'Sign up' and 'Forgot
  password' links ([#68](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/68)).

- Enable the selection tabs feature for all users.
  ([#71](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/71)).

- If an annotation fails to anchor within 500ms, mark it as an orphan. If it turns out
  that anchoring just took longer, it will move from the Orphans tab to the Annotations tab

  updates until the user is either logged in or explicitly interacts with the
  sidebar. This reduces load on the service

- Move the root UI layout for the sidebar app into the client. This makes it
  easier to serve the client from a web service or bundle it with a browser
  extension ([#37](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/37))

## [0.34.0] - 2016-07-15

### Changed

- Annotation / Notes tabs copy update and style tweaks
  ([#34](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/34))

  of view and back into view and not being reflected when searching after
  editing ([#7](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/7),
  [#8](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/8))

- Fix new annotations not being moved to current group when switching groups
