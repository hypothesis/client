      <p>
        I opened a book with a poet inside,<br />
        Their lines like a rollercoaster ride.<br />
        My pencil leapt up with a scholarly cheer—<br />
        <em>“At last I can scribble my insights right here!”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        But lo! came a voice from the margins so thin:<br />
        “No underlining, no arrows, no pen.<br />
        No brackets, no circles, no footnotes allowed,<br />
        Your thoughts must stay quiet, not shouted aloud.”
      </p>

      <p>
        So I sat with my notions all bottled in tight,<br />
        Each metaphor begging for comment that night.<br />
        The enjambment was itching, the rhyme scheme was sly,<br />
        The simile winked as it danced on by.
      </p>

      <p>
        I tried to behave, just a reader, not more,<br />
        But my fingers kept twitching like paws on the floor.<br />
        For reading a poem without leaving a mark<br />
        Feels like eating a s’more without touching the dark.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I closed it in silence, no notes in the page,<br />
        A scholar imprisoned inside of a cage.<br />
        And I muttered: “Dear poet, your lines were well-played,<br />
        But my best annotations are stuck in my head.”
