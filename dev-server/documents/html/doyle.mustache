    <p>
      "But why Turkish?" asked Mr. Sherlock Holmes, gazing fixedly at my boots.
      I was reclining in a cane-backed chair at the moment, and my protruded
      feet had attracted his ever-active attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      "English," I answered in some surprise. "I got them at Latimer's, in
      Oxford Street."
    </p>

    <p>
      Holmes smiled with an expression of weary patience.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The bath!" he said; "the bath! Why the relaxing and expensive Turkish
      rather than the invigorating home-made article?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Because for the last few days I have been feeling rheumatic and old. A
      Turkish bath is what we call an alterative in medicine--a fresh
      starting-point, a cleanser of the system.
    </p>

    <p>
      "By the way, Holmes," I added, "I have no doubt the connection between my
      boots and a Turkish bath is a perfectly self-evident one to a logical
      mind, and yet I should be obliged to you if you would indicate it."
    </p>

    <p>
      "The train of reasoning is not very obscure, Watson," said Holmes with a
      mischievous twinkle. "It belongs to the same elementary class of deduction
      which I should illustrate if I were to ask you who shared your cab in your
      drive this morning."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I don't admit that a fresh illustration is an explanation," said I with
      some asperity.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Bravo, Watson! A very dignified and logical remonstrance. Let me see,
      what were the points? Take the last one first--the cab. You observe that
      you have some splashes on the left sleeve and shoulder of your coat. Had
      you sat in the centre of a hansom you would probably have had no splashes,
      and if you had they would certainly have been symmetrical. Therefore it is
      clear that you sat at the side. Therefore it is equally clear that you had
      a companion."
    </p>

    <p>
      "That is very evident."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Absurdly commonplace, is it not?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "But the boots and the bath?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Equally childish. You are in the habit of doing up your boots in a
      certain way. I see them on this occasion fastened with an elaborate double
      bow, which is not your usual method of tying them. You have, therefore,
      had them off. Who has tied them? A bootmaker--or the boy at the bath. It
      is unlikely that it is the bootmaker, since your boots are nearly new.
      Well, what remains? The bath. Absurd, is it not? But, for all that, the
      Turkish bath has served a purpose."
    </p>

    <p>
      "What is that?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "You say that you have had it because you need a change. Let me suggest
      that you take one. How would Lausanne do, my dear Watson--first-class
      tickets and all expenses paid on a princely scale?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Splendid! But why?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Holmes leaned back in his armchair and took his notebook from his pocket.
    </p>

    <p>
      "One of the most dangerous classes in the world," said he, "is the
      drifting and friendless woman. She is the most harmless and often the most
      useful of mortals, but she is the inevitable inciter of crime in others.
      She is helpless. She is migratory. She has sufficient means to take her
      from country to country and from hotel to hotel. She is lost, as often as
      not, in a maze of obscure pensions and boardinghouses. She is a stray
      chicken in a world of foxes. When she is gobbled up she is hardly missed.
      I much fear that some evil has come to the Lady Frances Carfax."
    </p>

    <p>
      I was relieved at this sudden descent from the general to the particular.
      Holmes consulted his notes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Lady Frances," he continued, "is the sole survivor of the direct family
      of the late Earl of Rufton. The estates went, as you may remember, in the
      male line. She was left with limited means, but with some very remarkable
      old Spanish jewellery of silver and curiously cut diamonds to which she
      was fondly attached--too attached, for she refused to leave them with her
      banker and always carried them about with her. A rather pathetic figure,
      the Lady Frances, a beautiful woman, still in fresh middle age, and yet,
      by a strange change, the last derelict of what only twenty years ago was a
      goodly fleet."
    </p>

    <p>
      "What has happened to her, then?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah, what has happened to the Lady Frances? Is she alive or dead? There is
      our problem. She is a lady of precise habits, and for four years it has
      been her invariable custom to write every second week to Miss Dobney, her
      old governess, who has long retired and lives in Camberwell. It is this
      Miss Dobney who has consulted me. Nearly five weeks have passed without a
      word. The last letter was from the Hotel National at Lausanne. Lady
      Frances seems to have left there and given no address. The family are
      anxious, and as they are exceedingly wealthy no sum will be spared if we
      can clear the matter up."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is Miss Dobney the only source of information? Surely she had other
      correspondents?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "There is one correspondent who is a sure draw, Watson. That is the bank.
      Single ladies must live, and their passbooks are compressed diaries. She
      banks at Silvester's. I have glanced over her account. The last check but
      one paid her bill at Lausanne, but it was a large one and probably left
      her with cash in hand. Only one check has been drawn since."
    </p>

    <p>
      "To whom, and where?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "To Miss Marie Devine. There is nothing to show where the check was drawn.
      It was cashed at the Credit Lyonnais at Montpellier less than three weeks
      ago. The sum was fifty pounds."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And who is Miss Marie Devine?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "That also I have been able to discover. Miss Marie Devine was the maid of
      Lady Frances Carfax. Why she should have paid her this check we have not
      yet determined. I have no doubt, however, that your researches will soon
      clear the matter up."
    </p>

    <p>
      "MY researches!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Hence the health-giving expedition to Lausanne. You know that I cannot
      possibly leave London while old Abrahams is in such mortal terror of his
      life. Besides, on general principles it is best that I should not leave
      the country. Scotland Yard feels lonely without me, and it causes an
      unhealthy excitement among the criminal classes. Go, then, my dear Watson,
      and if my humble counsel can ever be valued at so extravagant a rate as
      two pence a word, it waits your disposal night and day at the end of the
      Continental wire."
    </p>

    <p>
      Two days later found me at the Hotel National at Lausanne, where I
      received every courtesy at the hands of M. Moser, the well-known manager.
      Lady Frances, as he informed me, had stayed there for several weeks. She
      had been much liked by all who met her. Her age was not more than forty.
      She was still handsome and bore every sign of having in her youth been a
      very lovely woman. M. Moser knew nothing of any valuable jewellery, but it
      had been remarked by the servants that the heavy trunk in the lady's
      bedroom was always scrupulously locked. Marie Devine, the maid, was as
      popular as her mistress. She was actually engaged to one of the head
      waiters in the hotel, and there was no difficulty in getting her address.
      It was 11 Rue de Trajan, Montpellier. All this I jotted down and felt that
      Holmes himself could not have been more adroit in collecting his facts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only one corner still remained in the shadow. No light which I possessed
      could clear up the cause for the lady's sudden departure. She was very
      happy at Lausanne. There was every reason to believe that she intended to
      remain for the season in her luxurious rooms overlooking the lake. And yet
      she had left at a single day's notice, which involved her in the useless
      payment of a week's rent. Only Jules Vibart, the lover of the maid, had
      any suggestion to offer. He connected the sudden departure with the visit
      to the hotel a day or two before of a tall, dark, bearded man. "Un
      sauvage--un veritable sauvage!" cried Jules Vibart. The man had rooms
      somewhere in the town. He had been seen talking earnestly to Madame on the
      promenade by the lake. Then he had called. She had refused to see him. He
      was English, but of his name there was no record. Madame had left the
      place immediately afterwards. Jules Vibart, and, what was of more
      importance, Jules Vibart's sweetheart, thought that this call and the
      departure were cause and effect. Only one thing Jules would not discuss.
      That was the reason why Marie had left her mistress. Of that he could or
      would say nothing. If I wished to know, I must go to Montpellier and ask
      her.
    </p>

    <p>
      So ended the first chapter of my inquiry. The second was devoted to the
      place which Lady Frances Carfax had sought when she left Lausanne.
      Concerning this there had been some secrecy, which confirmed the idea that
      she had gone with the intention of throwing someone off her track.
      Otherwise why should not her luggage have been openly labelled for Baden?
      Both she and it reached the Rhenish spa by some circuitous route. This
      much I gathered from the manager of Cook's local office. So to Baden I
      went, after dispatching to Holmes an account of all my proceedings and
      receiving in reply a telegram of half-humorous commendation.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Baden the track was not difficult to follow. Lady Frances had stayed at
      the Englischer Hof for a fortnight. While there she had made the
      acquaintance of a Dr. Shlessinger and his wife, a missionary from South
      America. Like most lonely ladies, Lady Frances found her comfort and
      occupation in religion. Dr. Shlessinger's remarkable personality, his
      whole hearted devotion, and the fact that he was recovering from a disease
      contracted in the exercise of his apostolic duties affected her deeply.
      She had helped Mrs. Shlessinger in the nursing of the convalescent saint.
      He spent his day, as the manager described it to me, upon a lounge-chair
      on the veranda, with an attendant lady upon either side of him. He was
      preparing a map of the Holy Land, with special reference to the kingdom of
      the Midianites, upon which he was writing a monograph. Finally, having
      improved much in health, he and his wife had returned to London, and Lady
      Frances had started thither in their company. This was just three weeks
      before, and the manager had heard nothing since. As to the maid, Marie,
      she had gone off some days beforehand in floods of tears, after informing
      the other maids that she was leaving service forever. Dr. Shlessinger had
      paid the bill of the whole party before his departure.
    </p>

    <p>
      "By the way," said the landlord in conclusion, "you are not the only
      friend of Lady Frances Carfax who is inquiring after her just now. Only a
      week or so ago we had a man here upon the same errand."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Did he give a name?" I asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      "None; but he was an Englishman, though of an unusual type."
    </p>

    <p>
      "A savage?" said I, linking my facts after the fashion of my illustrious
      friend.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Exactly. That describes him very well. He is a bulky, bearded, sunburned
      fellow, who looks as if he would be more at home in a farmers' inn than in
      a fashionable hotel. A hard, fierce man, I should think, and one whom I
      should be sorry to offend."
    </p>

    <p>
      Already the mystery began to define itself, as figures grow clearer with
      the lifting of a fog. Here was this good and pious lady pursued from place
      to place by a sinister and unrelenting figure. She feared him, or she
      would not have fled from Lausanne. He had still followed. Sooner or later
      he would overtake her. Had he already overtaken her? Was THAT the secret
      of her continued silence? Could the good people who were her companions
      not screen her from his violence or his blackmail? What horrible purpose,
      what deep design, lay behind this long pursuit? There was the problem
      which I had to solve.
    </p>

    <p>
      To Holmes I wrote showing how rapidly and surely I had got down to the
      roots of the matter. In reply I had a telegram asking for a description of
      Dr. Shlessinger's left ear. Holmes's ideas of humour are strange and
      occasionally offensive, so I took no notice of his ill-timed jest--indeed,
      I had already reached Montpellier in my pursuit of the maid, Marie, before
      his message came.
    </p>

    <p>
      I had no difficulty in finding the ex-servant and in learning all that she
      could tell me. She was a devoted creature, who had only left her mistress
      because she was sure that she was in good hands, and because her own
      approaching marriage made a separation inevitable in any case. Her
      mistress had, as she confessed with distress, shown some irritability of
      temper towards her during their stay in Baden, and had even questioned her
      once as if she had suspicions of her honesty, and this had made the
      parting easier than it would otherwise have been. Lady Frances had given
      her fifty pounds as a wedding-present. Like me, Marie viewed with deep
      distrust the stranger who had driven her mistress from Lausanne. With her
      own eyes she had seen him seize the lady's wrist with great violence on
      the public promenade by the lake. He was a fierce and terrible man. She
      believed that it was out of dread of him that Lady Frances had accepted
      the escort of the Shlessingers to London. She had never spoken to Marie
      about it, but many little signs had convinced the maid that her mistress
      lived in a state of continual nervous apprehension. So far she had got in
      her narrative, when suddenly she sprang from her chair and her face was
      convulsed with surprise and fear. "See!" she cried. "The miscreant follows
      still! There is the very man of whom I speak."
    </p>

    <p>
      Through the open sitting-room window I saw a huge, swarthy man with a
      bristling black beard walking slowly down the centre of the street and
      staring eagerly at the numbers of the houses. It was clear that, like
      myself, he was on the track of the maid. Acting upon the impulse of the
      moment, I rushed out and accosted him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "You are an Englishman," I said.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What if I am?" he asked with a most villainous scowl.
    </p>

    <p>
      "May I ask what your name is?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "No, you may not," said he with decision.
    </p>

    <p>
      The situation was awkward, but the most direct way is often the best.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Where is the Lady Frances Carfax?" I asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      He stared at me with amazement.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What have you done with her? Why have you pursued her? I insist upon an
      answer!" said I.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fellow gave a bellow of anger and sprang upon me like a tiger. I have
      held my own in many a struggle, but the man had a grip of iron and the
      fury of a fiend. His hand was on my throat and my senses were nearly gone
      before an unshaven French ouvrier in a blue blouse darted out from a
      cabaret opposite, with a cudgel in his hand, and struck my assailant a
      sharp crack over the forearm, which made him leave go his hold. He stood
      for an instant fuming with rage and uncertain whether he should not renew
      his attack. Then, with a snarl of anger, he left me and entered the
      cottage from which I had just come. I turned to thank my preserver, who
      stood beside me in the roadway.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, Watson," said he, "a very pretty hash you have made of it! I rather
      think you had better come back with me to London by the night express."
    </p>

    <p>
      An hour afterwards, Sherlock Holmes, in his usual garb and style, was
      seated in my private room at the hotel. His explanation of his sudden and
      opportune appearance was simplicity itself, for, finding that he could get
      away from London, he determined to head me off at the next obvious point
      of my travels. In the disguise of a workingman he had sat in the cabaret
      waiting for my appearance.
    </p>

    <p>
      "And a singularly consistent investigation you have made, my dear Watson,"
      said he. "I cannot at the moment recall any possible blunder which you
      have omitted. The total effect of your proceeding has been to give the
      alarm everywhere and yet to discover nothing."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Perhaps you would have done no better," I answered bitterly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There is no 'perhaps' about it. I HAVE done better. Here is the Hon.
      Philip Green, who is a fellow-lodger with you in this hotel, and we may
      find him the starting-point for a more successful investigation."
    </p>

    <p>
      A card had come up on a salver, and it was followed by the same bearded
      ruffian who had attacked me in the street. He started when he saw me.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What is this, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "I had your note and I have come.
      But what has this man to do with the matter?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "This is my old friend and associate, Dr. Watson, who is helping us in
      this affair."
    </p>

    <p>
      The stranger held out a huge, sunburned hand, with a few words of apology.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I hope I didn't harm you. When you accused me of hurting her I lost my
      grip of myself. Indeed, I'm not responsible in these days. My nerves are
      like live wires. But this situation is beyond me. What I want to know, in
      the first place, Mr. Holmes, is, how in the world you came to hear of my
      existence at all."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am in touch with Miss Dobney, Lady Frances's governess."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Old Susan Dobney with the mob cap! I remember her well."
    </p>

    <p>
      "And she remembers you. It was in the days before--before you found it
      better to go to South Africa."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah, I see you know my whole story. I need hide nothing from you. I swear
      to you, Mr. Holmes, that there never was in this world a man who loved a
      woman with a more wholehearted love than I had for Frances. I was a wild
      youngster, I know--not worse than others of my class. But her mind was
      pure as snow. She could not bear a shadow of coarseness. So, when she came
      to hear of things that I had done, she would have no more to say to me.
      And yet she loved me--that is the wonder of it!--loved me well enough to
      remain single all her sainted days just for my sake alone. When the years
      had passed and I had made my money at Barberton I thought perhaps I could
      seek her out and soften her. I had heard that she was still unmarried, I
      found her at Lausanne and tried all I knew. She weakened, I think, but her
      will was strong, and when next I called she had left the town. I traced
      her to Baden, and then after a time heard that her maid was here. I'm a
      rough fellow, fresh from a rough life, and when Dr. Watson spoke to me as
      he did I lost hold of myself for a moment. But for God's sake tell me what
      has become of the Lady Frances."
    </p>

    <p>
      "That is for us to find out," said Sherlock Holmes with peculiar gravity.
      "What is your London address, Mr. Green?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "The Langham Hotel will find me."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then may I recommend that you return there and be on hand in case I
      should want you? I have no desire to encourage false hopes, but you may
      rest assured that all that can be done will be done for the safety of Lady
      Frances. I can say no more for the instant. I will leave you this card so
      that you may be able to keep in touch with us. Now, Watson, if you will
      pack your bag I will cable to Mrs. Hudson to make one of her best efforts
      for two hungry travellers at 7:30 to-morrow."
    </p>

    <p></p>

    <p>
      A telegram was awaiting us when we reached our Baker Street rooms, which
      Holmes read with an exclamation of interest and threw across to me.
      "Jagged or torn," was the message, and the place of origin, Baden.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What is this?" I asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is everything," Holmes answered. "You may remember my seemingly
      irrelevant question as to this clerical gentleman's left ear. You did not
      answer it."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I had left Baden and could not inquire."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Exactly. For this reason I sent a duplicate to the manager of the
      Englischer Hof, whose answer lies here."
    </p>

    <p>
      "What does it show?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "It shows, my dear Watson, that we are dealing with an exceptionally
      astute and dangerous man. The Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, missionary from South
      America, is none other than Holy Peters, one of the most unscrupulous
      rascals that Australia has ever evolved--and for a young country it has
      turned out some very finished types. His particular specialty is the
      beguiling of lonely ladies by playing upon their religious feelings, and
      his so-called wife, an Englishwoman named Fraser, is a worthy helpmate.
      The nature of his tactics suggested his identity to me, and this physical
      peculiarity--he was badly bitten in a saloon-fight at Adelaide in
      '89--confirmed my suspicion. This poor lady is in the hands of a most
      infernal couple, who will stick at nothing, Watson. That she is already
      dead is a very likely supposition. If not, she is undoubtedly in some sort
      of confinement and unable to write to Miss Dobney or her other friends. It
      is always possible that she never reached London, or that she has passed
      through it, but the former is improbable, as, with their system of
      registration, it is not easy for foreigners to play tricks with the
      Continental police; and the latter is also unlikely, as these rouges could
      not hope to find any other place where it would be as easy to keep a
      person under restraint. All my instincts tell me that she is in London,
      but as we have at present no possible means of telling where, we can only
      take the obvious steps, eat our dinner, and possess our souls in patience.
      Later in the evening I will stroll down and have a word with friend
      Lestrade at Scotland Yard."
    </p>

    <p>
      But neither the official police nor Holmes's own small but very efficient
      organization sufficed to clear away the mystery. Amid the crowded millions
      of London the three persons we sought were as completely obliterated as if
      they had never lived. Advertisements were tried, and failed. Clues were
      followed, and led to nothing. Every criminal resort which Shlessinger
      might frequent was drawn in vain. His old associates were watched, but
      they kept clear of him. And then suddenly, after a week of helpless
      suspense there came a flash of light. A silver-and-brilliant pendant of
      old Spanish design had been pawned at Bovington's, in Westminster Road.
      The pawner was a large, clean-shaven man of clerical appearance. His name
      and address were demonstrably false. The ear had escaped notice, but the
      description was surely that of Shlessinger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Three times had our bearded friend from the Langham called for news--the
      third time within an hour of this fresh development. His clothes were
      getting looser on his great body. He seemed to be wilting away in his
      anxiety. "If you will only give me something to do!" was his constant
      wail. At last Holmes could oblige him.
    </p>

    <p>
      "He has begun to pawn the jewels. We should get him now."
    </p>

    <p>
      "But does this mean that any harm has befallen the Lady Frances?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Holmes shook his head very gravely.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Supposing that they have held her prisoner up to now, it is clear that
      they cannot let her loose without their own destruction. We must prepare
      for the worst."
    </p>

    <p>
      "What can I do?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "These people do not know you by sight?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "No."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is possible that he will go to some other pawnbroker in the future. In
      that case, we must begin again. On the other hand, he has had a fair price
      and no questions asked, so if he is in need of ready-money he will
      probably come back to Bovington's. I will give you a note to them, and
      they will let you wait in the shop. If the fellow comes you will follow
      him home. But no indiscretion, and, above all, no violence. I put you on
      your honour that you will take no step without my knowledge and consent."
    </p>

    <p>
      For two days the Hon. Philip Green (he was, I may mention, the son of the
      famous admiral of that name who commanded the Sea of Azof fleet in the
      Crimean War) brought us no news. On the evening of the third he rushed
      into our sitting-room, pale, trembling, with every muscle of his powerful
      frame quivering with excitement.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We have him! We have him!" he cried.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was incoherent in his agitation. Holmes soothed him with a few words
      and thrust him into an armchair.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Come, now, give us the order of events," said he.
    </p>

    <p>
      "She came only an hour ago. It was the wife, this time, but the pendant
      she brought was the fellow of the other. She is a tall, pale woman, with
      ferret eyes."
    </p>

    <p>
      "That is the lady," said Holmes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "She left the office and I followed her. She walked up the Kennington
      Road, and I kept behind her. Presently she went into a shop. Mr. Holmes,
      it was an undertaker's."
    </p>

    <p>
      My companion started. "Well?" he asked in that vibrant voice which told of
      the fiery soul behind the cold gray face.
    </p>

    <p>
      "She was talking to the woman behind the counter. I entered as well. 'It
      is late,' I heard her say, or words to that effect. The woman was excusing
      herself. 'It should be there before now,' she answered. 'It took longer,
      being out of the ordinary.' They both stopped and looked at me, so I asked
      some questions and then left the shop."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You did excellently well. What happened next?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "The woman came out, but I had hid myself in a doorway. Her suspicions had
      been aroused, I think, for she looked round her. Then she called a cab and
      got in. I was lucky enough to get another and so to follow her. She got
      down at last at No. 36, Poultney Square, Brixton. I drove past, left my
      cab at the corner of the square, and watched the house."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Did you see anyone?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "The windows were all in darkness save one on the lower floor. The blind
      was down, and I could not see in. I was standing there, wondering what I
      should do next, when a covered van drove up with two men in it. They
      descended, took something out of the van, and carried it up the steps to
      the hall door. Mr. Holmes, it was a coffin."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "For an instant I was on the point of rushing in. The door had been opened
      to admit the men and their burden. It was the woman who had opened it. But
      as I stood there she caught a glimpse of me, and I think that she
      recognized me. I saw her start, and she hastily closed the door. I
      remembered my promise to you, and here I am."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You have done excellent work," said Holmes, scribbling a few words upon a
      half-sheet of paper. "We can do nothing legal without a warrant, and you
      can serve the cause best by taking this note down to the authorities and
      getting one. There may be some difficulty, but I should think that the
      sale of the jewellery should be sufficient. Lestrade will see to all
      details."
    </p>

    <p>
      "But they may murder her in the meanwhile. What could the coffin mean, and
      for whom could it be but for her?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "We will do all that can be done, Mr. Green. Not a moment will be lost.
      Leave it in our hands. Now Watson," he added as our client hurried away,
      "he will set the regular forces on the move. We are, as usual, the
      irregulars, and we must take our own line of action. The situation strikes
      me as so desperate that the most extreme measures are justified. Not a
      moment is to be lost in getting to Poultney Square.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Let us try to reconstruct the situation," said he as we drove swiftly
      past the Houses of Parliament and over Westminster Bridge. "These villains
      have coaxed this unhappy lady to London, after first alienating her from
      her faithful maid. If she has written any letters they have been
      intercepted. Through some confederate they have engaged a furnished house.
      Once inside it, they have made her a prisoner, and they have become
      possessed of the valuable jewellery which has been their object from the
      first. Already they have begun to sell part of it, which seems safe enough
      to them, since they have no reason to think that anyone is interested in
      the lady's fate. When she is released she will, of course, denounce them.
      Therefore, she must not be released. But they cannot keep her under lock
      and key forever. So murder is their only solution."
    </p>

    <p>
      "That seems very clear."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Now we will take another line of reasoning. When you follow two separate
      chains of thought, Watson, you will find some point of intersection which
      should approximate to the truth. We will start now, not from the lady but
      from the coffin and argue backward. That incident proves, I fear, beyond
      all doubt that the lady is dead. It points also to an orthodox burial with
      proper accompaniment of medical certificate and official sanction. Had the
      lady been obviously murdered, they would have buried her in a hole in the
      back garden. But here all is open and regular. What does this mean? Surely
      that they have done her to death in some way which has deceived the doctor
      and simulated a natural end--poisoning, perhaps. And yet how strange that
      they should ever let a doctor approach her unless he were a confederate,
      which is hardly a credible proposition."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Could they have forged a medical certificate?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Dangerous, Watson, very dangerous. No, I hardly see them doing that. Pull
      up, cabby! This is evidently the undertaker's, for we have just passed the
      pawnbroker's. Would you go in, Watson? Your appearance inspires
      confidence. Ask what hour the Poultney Square funeral takes place
      to-morrow."
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman in the shop answered me without hesitation that it was to be at
      eight o'clock in the morning. "You see, Watson, no mystery; everything
      above-board! In some way the legal forms have undoubtedly been complied
      with, and they think that they have little to fear. Well, there's nothing
      for it now but a direct frontal attack. Are you armed?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "My stick!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, well, we shall be strong enough. 'Thrice is he armed who hath his
      quarrel just.' We simply can't afford to wait for the police or to keep
      within the four corners of the law. You can drive off, cabby. Now, Watson,
      we'll just take our luck together, as we have occasionally in the past."
    </p>

    <p>
      He had rung loudly at the door of a great dark house in the centre of
      Poultney Square. It was opened immediately, and the figure of a tall woman
      was outlined against the dim-lit hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, what do you want?" she asked sharply, peering at us through the
      darkness.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I want to speak to Dr. Shlessinger," said Holmes.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There is no such person here," she answered, and tried to close the door,
      but Holmes had jammed it with his foot.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, I want to see the man who lives here, whatever he may call
      himself," said Holmes firmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      She hesitated. Then she threw open the door. "Well, come in!" said she.
      "My husband is not afraid to face any man in the world." She closed the
      door behind us and showed us into a sitting-room on the right side of the
      hall, turning up the gas as she left us. "Mr. Peters will be with you in
      an instant," she said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her words were literally true, for we had hardly time to look around the
      dusty and moth-eaten apartment in which we found ourselves before the door
      opened and a big, clean-shaven bald-headed man stepped lightly into the
      room. He had a large red face, with pendulous cheeks, and a general air of
      superficial benevolence which was marred by a cruel, vicious mouth.
    </p>

    <p>
      "There is surely some mistake here, gentlemen," he said in an unctuous,
      make-everything-easy voice. "I fancy that you have been misdirected.
      Possibly if you tried farther down the street--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "That will do; we have no time to waste," said my companion firmly. "You
      are Henry Peters, of Adelaide, late the Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, of Baden and
      South America. I am as sure of that as that my own name is Sherlock
      Holmes."
    </p>

    <p>
      Peters, as I will now call him, started and stared hard at his formidable
      pursuer. "I guess your name does not frighten me, Mr. Holmes," said he
      coolly. "When a man's conscience is easy you can't rattle him. What is
      your business in my house?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "I want to know what you have done with the Lady Frances Carfax, whom you
      brought away with you from Baden."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I'd be very glad if you could tell me where that lady may be," Peters
      answered coolly. "I've a bill against her for nearly a hundred pounds, and
      nothing to show for it but a couple of trumpery pendants that the dealer
      would hardly look at. She attached herself to Mrs. Peters and me at
      Baden--it is a fact that I was using another name at the time--and she
      stuck on to us until we came to London. I paid her bill and her ticket.
      Once in London, she gave us the slip, and, as I say, left these
      out-of-date jewels to pay her bills. You find her, Mr. Holmes, and I'm
      your debtor."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I MEAN to find her," said Sherlock Holmes. "I'm going through this house
      till I do find her."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Where is your warrant?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Holmes half drew a revolver from his pocket. "This will have to serve till
      a better one comes."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why, you're a common burglar."
    </p>

    <p>
      "So you might describe me," said Holmes cheerfully. "My companion is also
      a dangerous ruffian. And together we are going through your house."
    </p>

    <p>
      Our opponent opened the door.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Fetch a policeman, Annie!" said he. There was a whisk of feminine skirts
      down the passage, and the hall door was opened and shut.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Our time is limited, Watson," said Holmes. "If you try to stop us,
      Peters, you will most certainly get hurt. Where is that coffin which was
      brought into your house?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "What do you want with the coffin? It is in use. There is a body in it."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I must see the body."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Never with my consent."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then without it." With a quick movement Holmes pushed the fellow to one
      side and passed into the hall. A door half opened stood immediately before
      us. We entered. It was the dining-room. On the table, under a half-lit
      chandelier, the coffin was lying. Holmes turned up the gas and raised the
      lid. Deep down in the recesses of the coffin lay an emaciated figure. The
      glare from the lights above beat down upon an aged and withered face. By
      no possible process of cruelty, starvation, or disease could this worn-out
      wreck be the still beautiful Lady Frances. Holmes's face showed his
      amazement, and also his relief.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Thank God!" he muttered. "It's someone else."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ah, you've blundered badly for once, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Peters,
      who had followed us into the room.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Who is the dead woman?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Well, if you really must know, she is an old nurse of my wife's, Rose
      Spender by name, whom we found in the Brixton Workhouse Infirmary. We
      brought her round here, called in Dr. Horsom, of 13 Firbank Villas--mind
      you take the address, Mr. Holmes--and had her carefully tended, as
      Christian folk should. On the third day she died--certificate says senile
      decay--but that's only the doctor's opinion, and of course you know
      better. We ordered her funeral to be carried out by Stimson and Co., of
      the Kennington Road, who will bury her at eight o'clock to-morrow morning.
      Can you pick any hole in that, Mr. Holmes? You've made a silly blunder,
      and you may as well own up to it. I'd give something for a photograph of
      your gaping, staring face when you pulled aside that lid expecting to see
      the Lady Frances Carfax and only found a poor old woman of ninety."
    </p>

    <p>
      Holmes's expression was as impassive as ever under the jeers of his
      antagonist, but his clenched hands betrayed his acute annoyance.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I am going through your house," said he.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Are you, though!" cried Peters as a woman's voice and heavy steps sounded
      in the passage. "We'll soon see about that. This way, officers, if you
      please. These men have forced their way into my house, and I cannot get
      rid of them. Help me to put them out."
    </p>

    <p>
      A sergeant and a constable stood in the doorway. Holmes drew his card from
      his case.
    </p>

    <p>
      "This is my name and address. This is my friend, Dr. Watson."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Bless you, sir, we know you very well," said the sergeant, "but you can't
      stay here without a warrant."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Of course not. I quite understand that."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Arrest him!" cried Peters.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We know where to lay our hands on this gentleman if he is wanted," said
      the sergeant majestically, "but you'll have to go, Mr. Holmes."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yes, Watson, we shall have to go."
    </p>

    <p>
      A minute later we were in the street once more. Holmes was as cool as
      ever, but I was hot with anger and humiliation. The sergeant had followed
      us.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sorry, Mr. Holmes, but that's the law."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Exactly, Sergeant, you could not do otherwise."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I expect there was good reason for your presence there. If there is
      anything I can do--"
    </p>

    <p>
      "It's a missing lady, Sergeant, and we think she is in that house. I
      expect a warrant presently."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Then I'll keep my eye on the parties, Mr. Holmes. If anything comes
      along, I will surely let you know."
    </p>

    <p>
      It was only nine o'clock, and we were off full cry upon the trail at once.
      First we drove to Brixton Workhouse Infirmary, where we found that it was
      indeed the truth that a charitable couple had called some days before,
      that they had claimed an imbecile old woman as a former servant, and that
      they had obtained permission to take her away with them. No surprise was
      expressed at the news that she had since died.
    </p>

    <p>
      The doctor was our next goal. He had been called in, had found the woman
      dying of pure senility, had actually seen her pass away, and had signed
      the certificate in due form. "I assure you that everything was perfectly
      normal and there was no room for foul play in the matter," said he.
      Nothing in the house had struck him as suspicious save that for people of
      their class it was remarkable that they should have no servant. So far and
      no further went the doctor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally we found our way to Scotland Yard. There had been difficulties of
      procedure in regard to the warrant. Some delay was inevitable. The
      magistrate's signature might not be obtained until next morning. If Holmes
      would call about nine he could go down with Lestrade and see it acted
      upon. So ended the day, save that near midnight our friend, the sergeant,
      called to say that he had seen flickering lights here and there in the
      windows of the great dark house, but that no one had left it and none had
      entered. We could but pray for patience and wait for the morrow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes was too irritable for conversation and too restless for
      sleep. I left him smoking hard, with his heavy, dark brows knotted
      together, and his long, nervous fingers tapping upon the arms of his
      chair, as he turned over in his mind every possible solution of the
      mystery. Several times in the course of the night I heard him prowling
      about the house. Finally, just after I had been called in the morning, he
      rushed into my room. He was in his dressing-gown, but his pale,
      hollow-eyed face told me that his night had been a sleepless one.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What time was the funeral? Eight, was it not?" he asked eagerly. "Well,
      it is 7:20 now. Good heavens, Watson, what has become of any brains that
      God has given me? Quick, man, quick! It's life or death--a hundred chances
      on death to one on life. I'll never forgive myself, never, if we are too
      late!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Five minutes had not passed before we were flying in a hansom down Baker
      Street. But even so it was twenty-five to eight as we passed Big Ben, and
      eight struck as we tore down the Brixton Road. But others were late as
      well as we. Ten minutes after the hour the hearse was still standing at
      the door of the house, and even as our foaming horse came to a halt the
      coffin, supported by three men, appeared on the threshold. Holmes darted
      forward and barred their way.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Take it back!" he cried, laying his hand on the breast of the foremost.
      "Take it back this instant!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "What the devil do you mean? Once again I ask you, where is your warrant?"
      shouted the furious Peters, his big red face glaring over the farther end
      of the coffin.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The warrant is on its way. The coffin shall remain in the house until it
      comes."
    </p>

    <p>
      The authority in Holmes's voice had its effect upon the bearers. Peters
      had suddenly vanished into the house, and they obeyed these new orders.
      "Quick, Watson, quick! Here is a screw-driver!" he shouted as the coffin
      was replaced upon the table. "Here's one for you, my man! A sovereign if
      the lid comes off in a minute! Ask no questions--work away! That's good!
      Another! And another! Now pull all together! It's giving! It's giving! Ah,
      that does it at last."
    </p>

    <p>
      With a united effort we tore off the coffin-lid. As we did so there came
      from the inside a stupefying and overpowering smell of chloroform. A body
      lay within, its head all wreathed in cotton-wool, which had been soaked in
      the narcotic. Holmes plucked it off and disclosed the statuesque face of a
      handsome and spiritual woman of middle age. In an instant he had passed
      his arm round the figure and raised her to a sitting position.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Is she gone, Watson? Is there a spark left? Surely we are not too late!"
    </p>

    <p>
      For half an hour it seemed that we were. What with actual suffocation, and
      what with the poisonous fumes of the chloroform, the Lady Frances seemed
      to have passed the last point of recall. And then, at last, with
      artificial respiration, with injected ether, and with every device that
      science could suggest, some flutter of life, some quiver of the eyelids,
      some dimming of a mirror, spoke of the slowly returning life. A cab had
      driven up, and Holmes, parting the blind, looked out at it. "Here is
      Lestrade with his warrant," said he. "He will find that his birds have
      flown. And here," he added as a heavy step hurried along the passage, "is
      someone who has a better right to nurse this lady than we have. Good
      morning, Mr. Green; I think that the sooner we can move the Lady Frances
      the better. Meanwhile, the funeral may proceed, and the poor old woman who
      still lies in that coffin may go to her last resting-place alone."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Should you care to add the case to your annals, my dear Watson," said
      Holmes that evening, "it can only be as an example of that temporary
      eclipse to which even the best-balanced mind may be exposed. Such slips
      are common to all mortals, and the greatest is he who can recognize and
      repair them. To this modified credit I may, perhaps, make some claim. My
      night was haunted by the thought that somewhere a clue, a strange
      sentence, a curious observation, had come under my notice and had been too
      easily dismissed. Then, suddenly, in the gray of the morning, the words
      came back to me. It was the remark of the undertaker's wife, as reported
      by Philip Green. She had said, 'It should be there before now. It took
      longer, being out of the ordinary.' It was the coffin of which she spoke.
      It had been out of the ordinary. That could only mean that it had been
      made to some special measurement. But why? Why? Then in an instant I
      remembered the deep sides, and the little wasted figure at the bottom. Why
      so large a coffin for so small a body? To leave room for another body.
      Both would be buried under the one certificate. It had all been so clear,
      if only my own sight had not been dimmed. At eight the Lady Frances would
      be buried. Our one chance was to stop the coffin before it left the house.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It was a desperate chance that we might find her alive, but it WAS a
      chance, as the result showed. These people had never, to my knowledge,
      done a murder. They might shrink from actual violence at the last. The
      could bury her with no sign of how she met her end, and even if she were
      exhumed there was a chance for them. I hoped that such considerations
      might prevail with them. You can reconstruct the scene well enough. You
      saw the horrible den upstairs, where the poor lady had been kept so long.
      They rushed in and overpowered her with their chloroform, carried her
      down, poured more into the coffin to insure against her waking, and then
      screwed down the lid. A clever device, Watson. It is new to me in the
      annals of crime. If our ex-missionary friends escape the clutches of
      Lestrade, I shall expect to hear of some brilliant incidents in their
      future career."

      all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm works. - You provide,

      Foundation and Michael Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
      trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below. 1.F.
      1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
      effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
      public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection.
      Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the
      medium on which they may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but
      not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription
      errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a
      defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer
      codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment. 1.F.2. LIMITED
      WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right of Replacement or
      Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary
      Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, and
      any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work under
      this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and
      expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR
      NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT
      EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
      TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
      LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
      INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
      DAMAGE. 1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
      defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
      receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
      written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
      received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
      your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the
      defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
      refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
      providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive
      the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also
      defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
      opportunities to fix the problem. 1.F.4. Except for the limited right of
      replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided
      to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
      INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR
      ANY PURPOSE. 1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain
      implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
      damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
      violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement
      shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation
      permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability
      of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining
      provisions. 1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the
      Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation,
      anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
      accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
      production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
      works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal
      fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which
      you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project
      Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions
      to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause. Section 2.
      Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm Project Gutenberg-tm
      is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats
      readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old,
      middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of
      hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
      Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
      they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and
      ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely
      available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary
      Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future
      for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the
      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and
      donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at
      http://www.pglaf.org. Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

      gbnewby@pglaf.org Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project
      Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon
      and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to
      carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and
      licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form
      accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
      Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to
      maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to
      complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in
      all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not
      uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees
      to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations
      in locations where we have not received written confirmation of
      compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for
      any particular state visit http://pglaf.org While we cannot and do not
      solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation
      requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited
      donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to
      donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
      make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
      outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please
      check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and
      addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
      including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,
      please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate Section 5. General Information About
      Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Professor Michael S. Hart is the
      originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic
      works that could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he
      produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose
      network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often
      created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as
      Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we
      do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
      edition. Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
      facility: http://www.gutenberg.net This Web site includes information
      about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project
      Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks,
      and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
