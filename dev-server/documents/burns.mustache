      Preface
    </h2>
    <p>
      Robert Burns was born near Ayr, Scotland, 25th of January, 1759. He was
      the son of William Burnes, or Burness, at the time of the poet's birth a
      nurseryman on the banks of the Doon in Ayrshire. His father, though always
      extremely poor, attempted to give his children a fair education, and
      Robert, who was the eldest, went to school for three years in a
      neighboring village, and later, for shorter periods, to three other
      schools in the vicinity. But it was to his father and to his own reading
      that he owed the more important part of his education; and by the time
      that he had reached manhood he had a good knowledge of English, a reading
      knowledge of French, and a fairly wide acquaintance with the masterpieces
      of English literature from the time of Shakespeare to his own day. In 1766
      William Burness rented on borrowed money the farm of Mount Oliphant, and
      in taking his share in the effort to make this undertaking succeed, the
      future poet seems to have seriously overstrained his physique. In 1771 the
      family move to Lochlea, and Burns went to the neighboring town of Irvine
      to learn flax-dressing. The only result of this experiment, however, was
      the formation of an acquaintance with a dissipated sailor, whom he
      afterward blamed as the prompter of his first licentious adventures. His
      father died in 1784, and with his brother Gilbert the poet rented the farm
      of Mossgiel; but this venture was as unsuccessful as the others. He had
      meantime formed an irregular intimacy with Jean Armour, for which he was
      censured by the Kirk-session. As a result of his farming misfortunes, and
      the attempts of his father-in-law to overthrow his irregular marriage with
      Jean, he resolved to emigrate; and in order to raise money for the passage
      he published (Kilmarnock, 1786) a volume of the poems which he had been
      composing from time to time for some years. This volume was unexpectedly
      successful, so that, instead of sailing for the West Indies, he went up to
      Edinburgh, and during that winter he was the chief literary celebrity of
      the season. An enlarged edition of his poems was published there in 1787,
      and the money derived from this enabled him to aid his brother in
      Mossgiel, and to take and stock for himself the farm of Ellisland in
      Dumfriesshire. His fame as poet had reconciled the Armours to the
      connection, and having now regularly married Jean, he brought her to
      Ellisland, and once more tried farming for three years. Continued
      ill-success, however, led him, in 1791, to abandon Ellisland, and he moved
      to Dumfries, where he had obtained a position in the Excise. But he was
      now thoroughly discouraged; his work was mere drudgery; his tendency to
      take his relaxation in debauchery increased the weakness of a constitution
      early undermined; and he died at Dumfries in his thirty-eighth year.

    <p>
      It is not necessary here to attempt to disentangle or explain away the
      numerous amours in which he was engaged through the greater part of his
      life. It is evident that Burns was a man of extremely passionate nature
      and fond of conviviality; and the misfortunes of his lot combined with his
      natural tendencies to drive him to frequent excesses of self-indulgence.
      He was often remorseful, and he strove painfully, if intermittently, after
      better things. But the story of his life must be admitted to be in its
      externals a painful and somewhat sordid chronicle. That it contained,
      however, many moments of joy and exaltation is proved by the poems here
      printed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns' poetry falls into two main groups: English and Scottish. His
      English poems are, for the most part, inferior specimens of conventional
      eighteenth-century verse. But in Scottish poetry he achieved triumphs of a
      quite extraordinary kind. Since the time of the Reformation and the union
      of the crowns of England and Scotland, the Scots dialect had largely
      fallen into disuse as a medium for dignified writing. Shortly before
      Burns' time, however, Allan Ramsay and Robert Fergusson had been the
      leading figures in a revival of the vernacular, and Burns received from
      them a national tradition which he succeeded in carrying to its highest
      pitch, becoming thereby, to an almost unique degree, the poet of his
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      He first showed complete mastery of verse in the field of satire. In “The
      Twa Herds,” “Holy Willie's Prayer,” “Address to the Unco Guid,” “The Holy
      Fair,” and others, he manifested sympathy with the protest of the
      so-called “New Light” party, which had sprung up in opposition to the
      extreme Calvinism and intolerance of the dominant “Auld Lichts.” The fact
      that Burns had personally suffered from the discipline of the Kirk
      probably added fire to his attacks, but the satires show more than
      personal animus. The force of the invective, the keenness of the wit, and
      the fervor of the imagination which they displayed, rendered them an
      important force in the theological liberation of Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kilmarnock volume contained, besides satire, a number of poems like
      “The Twa Dogs” and “The Cotter's Saturday Night,” which are vividly
      descriptive of the Scots peasant life with which he was most familiar; and
      a group like “Puir Mailie” and “To a Mouse,” which, in the tenderness of
      their treatment of animals, revealed one of the most attractive sides of
      Burns' personality. Many of his poems were never printed during his
      lifetime, the most remarkable of these being “The Jolly Beggars,” a piece
      in which, by the intensity of his imaginative sympathy and the brilliance
      of his technique, he renders a picture of the lowest dregs of society in
      such a way as to raise it into the realm of great poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the real national importance of Burns is due chiefly to his songs. The
      Puritan austerity of the centuries following the Reformation had
      discouraged secular music, like other forms of art, in Scotland; and as a
      result Scottish song had become hopelessly degraded in point both of
      decency and literary quality. From youth Burns had been interested in
      collecting the fragments he had heard sung or found printed, and he came
      to regard the rescuing of this almost lost national inheritance in the
      light of a vocation. About his song-making, two points are especially
      noteworthy: first, that the greater number of his lyrics sprang from
      actual emotional experiences; second, that almost all were composed to old
      melodies. While in Edinburgh he undertook to supply material for Johnson's
      “Musical Museum,” and as few of the traditional songs could appear in a
      respectable collection, Burns found it necessary to make them over.
      Sometimes he kept a stanza or two; sometimes only a line or chorus;
      sometimes merely the name of the air; the rest was his own. His method, as
      he has told us himself, was to become familiar with the traditional
      melody, to catch a suggestion from some fragment of the old song, to fix
      upon an idea or situation for the new poem; then, humming or whistling the
      tune as he went about his work, he wrought out the new verses, going into
      the house to write them down when the inspiration began to flag. In this
      process is to be found the explanation of much of the peculiar quality of
      the songs of Burns. Scarcely any known author has succeeded so brilliantly
      in combining his work with folk material, or in carrying on with such
      continuity of spirit the tradition of popular song. For George Thomson's
      collection of Scottish airs he performed a function similar to that which
      he had had in the “Museum”; and his poetical activity during the last
      eight or nine years of his life was chiefly devoted to these two
      publications. In spite of the fact that he was constantly in severe
      financial straits, he refused to accept any recompense for this work,
      preferring to regard it as a patriotic service. And it was, indeed, a
      patriotic service of no small magnitude. By birth and temperament he was
      singularly fitted for the task, and this fitness is proved by the unique
      extent to which his productions were accepted by his countrymen, and have
      passed into the life and feeling of his race.

      Song—Handsome Nell^1
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Tune—“I am a man unmarried.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     [Footnote 1: The first of my performances.—R. B.]

     Once I lov'd a bonie lass,
     Ay, and I love her still;
     And whilst that virtue warms my breast,
     I'll love my handsome Nell.

     As bonie lasses I hae seen,
     And mony full as braw;
     But, for a modest gracefu' mein,
     The like I never saw.

     A bonie lass, I will confess,
     Is pleasant to the e'e;
     But, without some better qualities,
     She's no a lass for me.

     But Nelly's looks are blythe and sweet,
     And what is best of a',
     Her reputation is complete,
     And fair without a flaw.

     She dresses aye sae clean and neat,
     Both decent and genteel;
     And then there's something in her gait
     Gars ony dress look weel.

     A gaudy dress and gentle air
     May slightly touch the heart;
     But it's innocence and modesty
     That polishes the dart.

     'Tis this in Nelly pleases me,
     'Tis this enchants my soul;
     For absolutely in my breast
     She reigns without control.

     Nae weel-tocher'd aunts, to wait on their drants,
     And wish them in hell for it a', man.

     I never was cannie for hoarding o' money,
     Or claughtin't together at a', man;
     I've little to spend, and naething to lend,
     But deevil a shilling I awe, man.

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Tune—“Laggan Burn.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Here's to thy health, my bonie lass,
     Gude nicht and joy be wi' thee;
     I'll come nae mair to thy bower-door,
     To tell thee that I lo'e thee.
     O dinna think, my pretty pink,
     But I can live without thee:
     I vow and swear I dinna care,
     How lang ye look about ye.

     Thou'rt aye sae free informing me,
     Thou hast nae mind to marry;
     I'll be as free informing thee,
     Nae time hae I to tarry:
     I ken thy frien's try ilka means
     Frae wedlock to delay thee;
     Depending on some higher chance,
     But fortune may betray thee.

     I ken they scorn my low estate,
     But that does never grieve me;
     For I'm as free as any he;
     Sma' siller will relieve me.
     I'll count my health my greatest wealth,
     Sae lang as I'll enjoy it;
     I'll fear nae scant, I'll bode nae want,
     As lang's I get employment.

     But far off fowls hae feathers fair,
     And, aye until ye try them,
     Tho' they seem fair, still have a care;
     They may prove waur than I am.
     But at twal' at night, when the moon shines bright,
     My dear, I'll come and see thee;
     For the man that loves his mistress weel,
     Nae travel makes him weary.

      Lass Of Cessnock Banks, The^1
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     [Footnote 1: The lass is identified as Ellison Begbie, a servant
      wench, daughter of a  “Farmer Lang”.]

     A Song of Similes

     Tune—“If he be a Butcher neat and trim.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     On Cessnock banks a lassie dwells;
     Could I describe her shape and mein;
     Our lasses a' she far excels,
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     She's sweeter than the morning dawn,
     When rising Phoebus first is seen,
     And dew-drops twinkle o'er the lawn;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     She's stately like yon youthful ash,
     That grows the cowslip braes between,
     And drinks the stream with vigour fresh;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     She's spotless like the flow'ring thorn,
     With flow'rs so white and leaves so green,
     When purest in the dewy morn;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her looks are like the vernal May,
     When ev'ning Phoebus shines serene,
     While birds rejoice on every spray;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her hair is like the curling mist,
     That climbs the mountain-sides at e'en,
     When flow'r-reviving rains are past;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her forehead's like the show'ry bow,
     When gleaming sunbeams intervene
     And gild the distant mountain's brow;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her cheeks are like yon crimson gem,
     The pride of all the flowery scene,
     Just opening on its thorny stem;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her bosom's like the nightly snow,
     When pale the morning rises keen,
     While hid the murm'ring streamlets flow;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her lips are like yon cherries ripe,
     That sunny walls from Boreas screen;
     They tempt the taste and charm the sight;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her teeth are like a flock of sheep,
     With fleeces newly washen clean,
     That slowly mount the rising steep;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her breath is like the fragrant breeze,
     That gently stirs the blossom'd bean,
     When Phoebus sinks behind the seas;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her voice is like the ev'ning thrush,
     That sings on Cessnock banks unseen,
     While his mate sits nestling in the bush;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     But it's not her air, her form, her face,
     Tho' matching beauty's fabled queen;
     'Tis the mind that shines in ev'ry grace,
     An' chiefly in her roguish een.

     How blythely was I bide the stour,

     Yestreen, when to the trembling string
     The dance gaed thro' the lighted ha',
     To thee my fancy took its wing,
     I sat, but neither heard nor saw:
     Tho' this was fair, and that was braw,
     And yon the toast of a' the town,
     I sigh'd, and said among them a',
     “Ye are na Mary Morison.”

     Oh, Mary, canst thou wreck his peace,
     Wha for thy sake wad gladly die?
     Or canst thou break that heart of his,

     Arose at Thy command;

     That Pow'r which rais'd and still upholds

     Was ever still the same.

     Those mighty periods of years
     Which seem to us so vast,
     Appear no more before Thy sight

     Thou giv'st the word: Thy creature, man,
     Is to existence brought;
     Again Thou say'st, “Ye sons of men,
     Return ye into nought!”

     Thou layest them, with all their cares,
     In everlasting sleep;

     The peer I don't envy, I give him his bow;

     The past was bad, and the future hid, its good or ill untried, O;
     But the present hour was in my pow'r, and so I would enjoy it, O.

     No help, nor hope, nor view had I, nor person to befriend me, O;
     So I must toil, and sweat, and moil, and labour to sustain me, O;
     To plough and sow, to reap and mow, my father bred me early, O;
     For one, he said, to labour bred, was a match for Fortune fairly, O.

     Thus all obscure, unknown, and poor, thro' life I'm doom'd to wander, O,
     Till down my weary bones I lay in everlasting slumber, O:
     No view nor care, but shun whate'er might breed me pain or sorrow, O;
     I live to-day as well's I may, regardless of to-morrow, O.

     But cheerful still, I am as well as a monarch in his palace, O,
     Tho' Fortune's frown still hunts me down, with all her wonted malice, O:
     I make indeed my daily bread, but ne'er can make it farther, O:
     But as daily bread is all I need, I do not much regard her, O.

     When sometimes by my labour, I earn a little money, O,
     Some unforeseen misfortune comes gen'rally upon me, O;
     Mischance, mistake, or by neglect, or my goodnatur'd folly, O:
     But come what will, I've sworn it still, I'll ne'er be melancholy, O.

     All you who follow wealth and power with unremitting ardour, O,
     The more in this you look for bliss, you leave your view the farther, O:
     Had you the wealth Potosi boasts, or nations to adore you, O,
     A cheerful honest-hearted clown I will prefer before you, O.

      John Barleycorn: A Ballad
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     There was three kings into the east,
     Three kings both great and high,
     And they hae sworn a solemn oath
     John Barleycorn should die.

     They took a plough and plough'd him down,
     Put clods upon his head,
     And they hae sworn a solemn oath
     John Barleycorn was dead.

     But the cheerful Spring came kindly on,
     And show'rs began to fall;
     John Barleycorn got up again,
     And sore surpris'd them all.

     The sultry suns of Summer came,
     And he grew thick and strong;
     His head weel arm'd wi' pointed spears,
     That no one should him wrong.

     The sober Autumn enter'd mild,
     When he grew wan and pale;
     His bending joints and drooping head
     Show'd he began to fail.

     His colour sicken'd more and more,
     He faded into age;
     And then his enemies began
     To show their deadly rage.

     They've taen a weapon, long and sharp,
     And cut him by the knee;
     Then tied him fast upon a cart,
     Like a rogue for forgerie.

     They laid him down upon his back,
     And cudgell'd him full sore;
     They hung him up before the storm,
     And turned him o'er and o'er.

     They filled up a darksome pit
     With water to the brim;
     They heaved in John Barleycorn,
     There let him sink or swim.

     They laid him out upon the floor,
     To work him farther woe;
     And still, as signs of life appear'd,
     They toss'd him to and fro.

     They wasted, o'er a scorching flame,
     The marrow of his bones;
     But a miller us'd him worst of all,
     For he crush'd him between two stones.

     And they hae taen his very heart's blood,
     And drank it round and round;
     And still the more and more they drank,
     Their joy did more abound.

     John Barleycorn was a hero bold,
     Of noble enterprise;
     For if you do but taste his blood,
     'Twill make your courage rise.

     'Twill make a man forget his woe;
     'Twill heighten all his joy;
     'Twill make the widow's heart to sing,
     Tho' the tear were in her eye.

     Then let us toast John Barleycorn,
     Each man a glass in hand;
     And may his great posterity
     Ne'er fail in old Scotland!

      Death And Dying Words Of Poor Mailie, The Author's Only Pet Yowe., The
    </h2>
    <h3>
      An Unco Mournfu' Tale
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     As Mailie, an' her lambs thegither,
     Was ae day nibbling on the tether,
     Upon her cloot she coost a hitch,
     An' owre she warsl'd in the ditch:
     There, groaning, dying, she did lie,
     When Hughoc he cam doytin by.

     Wi' glowrin een, and lifted han's
     Poor Hughoc like a statue stan's;
     He saw her days were near-hand ended,
     But, wae's my heart! he could na mend it!
     He gaped wide, but naething spak,
     At langth poor Mailie silence brak.

     “O thou, whase lamentable face
     Appears to mourn my woefu' case!
     My dying words attentive hear,
     An' bear them to my Master dear.

     “Tell him, if e'er again he keep
     As muckle gear as buy a sheep—
     O, bid him never tie them mair,
     Wi' wicked strings o' hemp or hair!
     But ca' them out to park or hill,
     An' let them wander at their will:
     So may his flock increase, an' grow
     To scores o' lambs, an' packs o' woo'!

     “Tell him, he was a Master kin',
     An' aye was guid to me an' mine;
     An' now my dying charge I gie him,
     My helpless lambs, I trust them wi' him.

     “O, bid him save their harmless lives,
     Frae dogs, an' tods, an' butcher's knives!
     But gie them guid cow-milk their fill,
     Till they be fit to fend themsel';
     An' tent them duly, e'en an' morn,
     Wi' taets o' hay an' ripps o' corn.

     “An' may they never learn the gaets,
     Of ither vile, wanrestfu' pets—
     To slink thro' slaps, an' reave an' steal
     At stacks o' pease, or stocks o' kail!
     So may they, like their great forbears,
     For mony a year come thro the shears:
     So wives will gie them bits o' bread,
     An' bairns greet for them when they're dead.

     “My poor toop-lamb, my son an' heir,
     O, bid him breed him up wi' care!
     An' if he live to be a beast,
     To pit some havins in his breast!

     “An' warn him—what I winna name—
     To stay content wi' yowes at hame;
     An' no to rin an' wear his cloots,
     Like ither menseless, graceless brutes.

     “An' neist, my yowie, silly thing,
     Gude keep thee frae a tether string!
     O, may thou ne'er forgather up,
     Wi' ony blastit, moorland toop;
     But aye keep mind to moop an' mell,
     Wi' sheep o' credit like thysel'!

     “And now, my bairns, wi' my last breath,
     I lea'e my blessin wi' you baith:
     An' when you think upo' your mither,
     Mind to be kind to ane anither.

     “Now, honest Hughoc, dinna fail,
     To tell my master a' my tale;
     An' bid him burn this cursed tether,
     An' for thy pains thou'se get my blather.”

     This said, poor Mailie turn'd her head,
     And clos'd her een amang the dead!

      Poor Mailie's Elegy
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Lament in rhyme, lament in prose,
     Wi' saut tears trickling down your nose;
     Our bardie's fate is at a close,
     Past a' remead!
     The last, sad cape-stane o' his woes;
     Poor Mailie's dead!

     It's no the loss o' warl's gear,
     That could sae bitter draw the tear,
     Or mak our bardie, dowie, wear
     The mourning weed:
     He's lost a friend an' neebor dear
     In Mailie dead.

     Thro' a' the town she trotted by him;
     A lang half-mile she could descry him;
     Wi' kindly bleat, when she did spy him,
     She ran wi' speed:
     A friend mair faithfu' ne'er cam nigh him,
     Than Mailie dead.

     I wat she was a sheep o' sense,
     An' could behave hersel' wi' mense:
     I'll say't, she never brak a fence,
     Thro' thievish greed.
     Our bardie, lanely, keeps the spence
     Sin' Mailie's dead.

     Or, if he wanders up the howe,
     Her living image in her yowe
     Comes bleating till him, owre the knowe,
     For bits o' bread;
     An' down the briny pearls rowe
     For Mailie dead.

     She was nae get o' moorland tips,
     Wi' tauted ket, an' hairy hips;
     For her forbears were brought in ships,
     Frae 'yont the Tweed.
     A bonier fleesh ne'er cross'd the clips
     Than Mailie's dead.

     Wae worth the man wha first did shape
     That vile, wanchancie thing—a raip!
     It maks guid fellows girn an' gape,
     Wi' chokin dread;
     An' Robin's bonnet wave wi' crape
     For Mailie dead.

     O, a' ye bards on bonie Doon!
     An' wha on Ayr your chanters tune!
     Come, join the melancholious croon
     O' Robin's reed!
     His heart will never get aboon—
     His Mailie's dead!

      Song—The Rigs O' Barley
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Tune—“Corn Rigs are bonie.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     It was upon a Lammas night,
     When corn rigs are bonie,
     Beneath the moon's unclouded light,
     I held awa to Annie;
     The time flew by, wi' tentless heed,
     Till, 'tween the late and early,
     Wi' sma' persuasion she agreed
     To see me thro' the barley.

     Corn rigs, an' barley rigs,
     An' corn rigs are bonie:
     I'll ne'er forget that happy night,
     Amang the rigs wi' Annie.

     The sky was blue, the wind was still,
     The moon was shining clearly;
     I set her down, wi' right good will,
     Amang the rigs o' barley:
     I ken't her heart was a' my ain;
     I lov'd her most sincerely;

     I kiss'd her owre and owre again,
     Amang the rigs o' barley.
     Corn rigs, an' barley rigs, &amp;c.

     I lock'd her in my fond embrace;
     Her heart was beating rarely:
     My blessings on that happy place,
     Amang the rigs o' barley!
     But by the moon and stars so bright,
     That shone that hour so clearly!
     She aye shall bless that happy night
     Amang the rigs o' barley.
     Corn rigs, an' barley rigs, &amp;c.

     I hae been blythe wi' comrades dear;
     I hae been merry drinking;
     I hae been joyfu' gath'rin gear;
     I hae been happy thinking:
     But a' the pleasures e'er I saw,
     Tho' three times doubl'd fairly,
     That happy night was worth them a',
     Amang the rigs o' barley.
     Corn rigs, an' barley rigs, &amp;c.

      Song Composed In August
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Tune—“I had a horse, I had nae mair.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Now westlin winds and slaught'ring guns
     Bring Autumn's pleasant weather;
     The moorcock springs on whirring wings
     Amang the blooming heather:
     Now waving grain, wide o'er the plain,
     Delights the weary farmer;
     And the moon shines bright, when I rove at night,
     To muse upon my charmer.

     The partridge loves the fruitful fells,
     The plover loves the mountains;
     The woodcock haunts the lonely dells,
     The soaring hern the fountains:
     Thro' lofty groves the cushat roves,
     The path of man to shun it;
     The hazel bush o'erhangs the thrush,
     The spreading thorn the linnet.

     Thus ev'ry kind their pleasure find,
     The savage and the tender;
     Some social join, and leagues combine,
     Some solitary wander:
     Avaunt, away! the cruel sway,
     Tyrannic man's dominion;
     The sportsman's joy, the murd'ring cry,
     The flutt'ring, gory pinion!

     But, Peggy dear, the ev'ning's clear,
     Thick flies the skimming swallow,
     The sky is blue, the fields in view,
     All fading-green and yellow:
     Come let us stray our gladsome way,
     And view the charms of Nature;
     The rustling corn, the fruited thorn,
     And ev'ry happy creature.

     We'll gently walk, and sweetly talk,
     Till the silent moon shine clearly;
     I'll grasp thy waist, and, fondly prest,
     Swear how I love thee dearly:
     Not vernal show'rs to budding flow'rs,
     Not Autumn to the farmer,
     So dear can be as thou to me,
     My fair, my lovely charmer!

      Epistle To John Rankine
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Enclosing Some Poems

     O Rough, rude, ready-witted Rankine,
     The wale o' cocks for fun an' drinkin!
     There's mony godly folks are thinkin,
     Your dreams and tricks
     Will send you, Korah-like, a-sinkin
     Straught to auld Nick's.

     Ye hae saw mony cracks an' cants,
     And in your wicked, drucken rants,
     Ye mak a devil o' the saunts,
     An' fill them fou;
     And then their failings, flaws, an' wants,
     Are a' seen thro'.

     Hypocrisy, in mercy spare it!
     That holy robe, O dinna tear it!
     Spare't for their sakes, wha aften wear it—
     The lads in black;
     But your curst wit, when it comes near it,
     Rives't aff their back.

     Think, wicked Sinner, wha ye're skaithing:
     It's just the Blue-gown badge an' claithing
     O' saunts; tak that, ye lea'e them naething
     To ken them by
     Frae ony unregenerate heathen,
     Like you or I.

     I've sent you here some rhyming ware,
     A' that I bargain'd for, an' mair;
     Sae, when ye hae an hour to spare,
     I will expect,
     Yon sang ye'll sen't, wi' cannie care,
     And no neglect.

     Tho' faith, sma' heart hae I to sing!
     My muse dow scarcely spread her wing;
     I've play'd mysel a bonie spring,
     An' danc'd my fill!
     I'd better gaen an' sair't the king,
     At Bunkjer's Hill.

     'Twas ae night lately, in my fun,
     I gaed a rovin' wi' the gun,
     An' brought a paitrick to the grun'—
     A bonie hen;
     And, as the twilight was begun,
     Thought nane wad ken.

     The poor, wee thing was little hurt;
     I straikit it a wee for sport,
     Ne'er thinkin they wad fash me for't;
     But, Deil-ma-care!
     Somebody tells the poacher-court
     The hale affair.

     Some auld, us'd hands had taen a note,
     That sic a hen had got a shot;
     I was suspected for the plot;
     I scorn'd to lie;
     So gat the whissle o' my groat,
     An' pay't the fee.

     But by my gun, o' guns the wale,
     An' by my pouther an' my hail,
     An' by my hen, an' by her tail,
     I vow an' swear!
     The game shall pay, o'er muir an' dale,
     For this, niest year.

     As soon's the clockin-time is by,
     An' the wee pouts begun to cry,
     Lord, I'se hae sporting by an' by
     For my gowd guinea,
     Tho' I should herd the buckskin kye
     For't in Virginia.

     Trowth, they had muckle for to blame!
     'Twas neither broken wing nor limb,
     But twa-three draps about the wame,
     Scarce thro' the feathers;
     An' baith a yellow George to claim,
     An' thole their blethers!

     It pits me aye as mad's a hare;
     So I can rhyme nor write nae mair;
     But pennyworths again is fair,
     When time's expedient:
     Meanwhile I am, respected Sir,
     Your most obedient.

      A Poet's Welcome To His Love-Begotten Daughter^1

     The First Instance That Entitled Him To
     The Venerable Appellation Of Father
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Thou's welcome, wean; mishanter fa' me,
     If thoughts o' thee, or yet thy mamie,
     Shall ever daunton me or awe me,
     My bonie lady,
     Or if I blush when thou shalt ca' me
     Tyta or daddie.

     Tho' now they ca' me fornicator,
     An' tease my name in kintry clatter,
     The mair they talk, I'm kent the better,
     E'en let them clash;
     An auld wife's tongue's a feckless matter
     To gie ane fash.

     Welcome! my bonie, sweet, wee dochter,
     Tho' ye come here a wee unsought for,
     And tho' your comin' I hae fought for,
     Baith kirk and queir;
     Yet, by my faith, ye're no unwrought for,
     That I shall swear!

     Wee image o' my bonie Betty,
     As fatherly I kiss and daut thee,
     As dear, and near my heart I set thee
     Wi' as gude will
     As a' the priests had seen me get thee
     That's out o' hell.

     Sweet fruit o' mony a merry dint,
     My funny toil is now a' tint,
     Sin' thou came to the warl' asklent,
     Which fools may scoff at;
     In my last plack thy part's be in't
     The better ha'f o't.

     Tho' I should be the waur bestead,
     Thou's be as braw and bienly clad,
     And thy young years as nicely bred
     Wi' education,
     As ony brat o' wedlock's bed,
     In a' thy station.

     Lord grant that thou may aye inherit
     Thy mither's person, grace, an' merit,
     An' thy poor, worthless daddy's spirit,
     Without his failins,
     'Twill please me mair to see thee heir it,
     Than stockit mailens.

     For if thou be what I wad hae thee,
     And tak the counsel I shall gie thee,
     I'll never rue my trouble wi' thee,
     The cost nor shame o't,
     But be a loving father to thee,
     And brag the name o't.

      Song—O Leave Novels^1
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     [Footnote 1: Burns never published this poem.]

     O leave novels, ye Mauchline belles,
     Ye're safer at your spinning-wheel;
     Such witching books are baited hooks
     For rakish rooks, like Rob Mossgiel;
     Your fine Tom Jones and Grandisons,
     They make your youthful fancies reel;
     They heat your brains, and fire your veins,
     And then you're prey for Rob Mossgiel.

     Beware a tongue that's smoothly hung,
     A heart that warmly seems to feel;
     That feeling heart but acts a part—
     'Tis rakish art in Rob Mossgiel.
     The frank address, the soft caress,
     Are worse than poisoned darts of steel;
     The frank address, and politesse,
     Are all finesse in Rob Mossgiel.

     One ev'ning, as I wander'd forth
     Along the banks of Ayr,
     I spied a man, whose aged step
     Seem'd weary, worn with care;
     His face furrow'd o'er with years,
     And hoary was his hair.

     “Young stranger, whither wand'rest thou?”
      Began the rev'rend sage;
     “Does thirst of wealth thy step constrain,
     Or youthful pleasure's rage?
     Or haply, prest with cares and woes,
     Too soon thou hast began
     To wander forth, with me to mourn
     The miseries of man.

     “The sun that overhangs yon moors,
     Out-spreading far and wide,
     Where hundreds labour to support
     A haughty lordling's pride;—
     I've seen yon weary winter-sun
     Twice forty times return;
     And ev'ry time has added proofs,
     That man was made to mourn.

     “O man! while in thy early years,
     How prodigal of time!
     Mis-spending all thy precious hours—
     Thy glorious, youthful prime!
     Alternate follies take the sway;
     Licentious passions burn;
     Which tenfold force gives Nature's law.
     That man was made to mourn.

     “Look not alone on youthful prime,
     Or manhood's active might;
     Man then is useful to his kind,
     Supported in his right:
     But see him on the edge of life,
     With cares and sorrows worn;
     Then Age and Want—oh! ill-match'd pair—
     Shew man was made to mourn.

     “A few seem favourites of fate,
     In pleasure's lap carest;
     Yet, think not all the rich and great
     Are likewise truly blest:
     But oh! what crowds in ev'ry land,
     All wretched and forlorn,
     Thro' weary life this lesson learn,
     That man was made to mourn.

     “Many and sharp the num'rous ills
     Inwoven with our frame!
     More pointed still we make ourselves,
     Regret, remorse, and shame!
     And man, whose heav'n-erected face
     The smiles of love adorn,—
     Man's inhumanity to man
     Makes countless thousands mourn!

     “See yonder poor, o'erlabour'd wight,
     So abject, mean, and vile,
     Who begs a brother of the earth
     To give him leave to toil;
     And see his lordly fellow-worm
     The poor petition spurn,
     Unmindful, tho' a weeping wife
     And helpless offspring mourn.

     “If I'm design'd yon lordling's slave,
     By Nature's law design'd,
     Why was an independent wish
     E'er planted in my mind?
     If not, why am I subject to
     His cruelty, or scorn?
     Or why has man the will and pow'r
     To make his fellow mourn?

     “Yet, let not this too much, my son,
     Disturb thy youthful breast:
     This partial view of human-kind
     Is surely not the last!
     The poor, oppressed, honest man
     Had never, sure, been born,
     Had there not been some recompense
     To comfort those that mourn!

     “O Death! the poor man's dearest friend,
     The kindest and the best!
     Welcome the hour my aged limbs
     Are laid with thee at rest!
     The great, the wealthy fear thy blow
     From pomp and pleasure torn;
     But, oh! a blest relief for those
     That weary-laden mourn!”

      The Twa Herds; Or, The Holy Tulyie
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     An Unco Mournfu' Tale
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     “Blockheads with reason wicked wits abhor,
     But fool with fool is barbarous civil war,”—Pope.

     O a' ye pious godly flocks,
     Weel fed on pastures orthodox,
     Wha now will keep you frae the fox,
     Or worrying tykes?
     Or wha will tent the waifs an' crocks,
     About the dykes?

     The twa best herds in a' the wast,
     The e'er ga'e gospel horn a blast
     These five an' twenty simmers past—
     Oh, dool to tell!
     Hae had a bitter black out-cast
     Atween themsel'.

     O, Moddie,^1 man, an' wordy Russell,^2
     How could you raise so vile a bustle;
     Ye'll see how New-Light herds will whistle,
     An' think it fine!
     The Lord's cause ne'er gat sic a twistle,
     Sin' I hae min'.

     O, sirs! whae'er wad hae expeckit
     Your duty ye wad sae negleckit,
     Ye wha were ne'er by lairds respeckit
     To wear the plaid;
     But by the brutes themselves eleckit,
     To be their guide.

     What flock wi' Moodie's flock could rank?—
     Sae hale and hearty every shank!
     Nae poison'd soor Arminian stank
     He let them taste;
     Frae Calvin's well, aye clear, drank,—
     O, sic a feast!

     [Footnote 1: Rev. Mr. Moodie of Riccarton.]

     [Footnote 2: Rev. John Russell of Kilmarnock.]

     The thummart, willcat, brock, an' tod,
     Weel kend his voice thro' a' the wood,
     He smell'd their ilka hole an' road,
     Baith out an in;
     An' weel he lik'd to shed their bluid,
     An' sell their skin.

     What herd like Russell tell'd his tale;
     His voice was heard thro' muir and dale,
     He kenn'd the Lord's sheep, ilka tail,
     Owre a' the height;
     An' saw gin they were sick or hale,
     At the first sight.

     He fine a mangy sheep could scrub,
     Or nobly fling the gospel club,
     And New-Light herds could nicely drub
     Or pay their skin;
     Could shake them o'er the burning dub,
     Or heave them in.

     Sic twa—O! do I live to see't?—
     Sic famous twa should disagree't,
     And names, like “villain,” “hypocrite,”
      Ilk ither gi'en,
     While New-Light herds, wi' laughin spite,
     Say neither's liein!

     A' ye wha tent the gospel fauld,
     There's Duncan^3 deep, an' Peebles^4 shaul,
     But chiefly thou, apostle Auld,^5
     We trust in thee,
     That thou wilt work them, het an' cauld,
     Till they agree.

     Consider, sirs, how we're beset;
     There's scarce a new herd that we get,
     But comes frae 'mang that cursed set,
     I winna name;
     I hope frae heav'n to see them yet
     In fiery flame.

     [Footnote 4: Rev. Wm. Peebles of Newton-on-Ayr.]

     [Footnote 5: Rev. Wm. Auld of Mauchline.]

     Dalrymple^6 has been lang our fae,

     An' that curs'd rascal ca'd M'Quhae,^8
     And baith the Shaws,^9
     That aft hae made us black an' blae,
     Wi' vengefu' paws.

     Auld Wodrow^10 lang has hatch'd mischief;
     We thought aye death wad bring relief;
     But he has gotten, to our grief,
     Ane to succeed him,^11
     A chield wha'll soundly buff our beef;
     I meikle dread him.

     And mony a ane that I could tell,
     Wha fain wad openly rebel,
     Forby turn-coats amang oursel',
     There's Smith^12 for ane;
     I doubt he's but a grey nick quill,
     An' that ye'll fin'.

     O! a' ye flocks o'er a, the hills,
     By mosses, meadows, moors, and fells,
     Come, join your counsel and your skills
     To cowe the lairds,
     An' get the brutes the power themsel's
     To choose their herds.

     Then Orthodoxy yet may prance,
     An' Learning in a woody dance,
     An' that fell cur ca'd Common Sense,
     That bites sae sair,
     Be banished o'er the sea to France:
     Let him bark there.

      Epistle To Davie, A Brother Poet
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     January

     While winds frae aff Ben-Lomond blaw,
     An' bar the doors wi' driving snaw,
     An' hing us owre the ingle,
     I set me down to pass the time,
     An' spin a verse or twa o' rhyme,
     In hamely, westlin jingle.
     While frosty winds blaw in the drift,
     Ben to the chimla lug,
     I grudge a wee the great-folk's gift,
     That live sae bien an' snug:
     I tent less, and want less
     Their roomy fire-side;
     But hanker, and canker,
     To see their cursed pride.

     It's hardly in a body's pow'r
     To keep, at times, frae being sour,
     To see how things are shar'd;
     How best o' chiels are whiles in want,
     While coofs on countless thousands rant,
     And ken na how to wair't;
     But, Davie, lad, ne'er fash your head,
     Tho' we hae little gear;
     We're fit to win our daily bread,
     As lang's we're hale and fier:
     “Mair spier na, nor fear na,”^1
     Auld age ne'er mind a feg;
     The last o't, the warst o't
     Is only but to beg.

     To lie in kilns and barns at e'en,
     When banes are craz'd, and bluid is thin,
     Is doubtless, great distress!

     [Footnote 1: Ramsay.—R. B.]

     Yet then content could make us blest;
     Ev'n then, sometimes, we'd snatch a taste
     Of truest happiness.
     The honest heart that's free frae a'
     Intended fraud or guile,
     However Fortune kick the ba',
     Has aye some cause to smile;
     An' mind still, you'll find still,
     A comfort this nae sma';
     Nae mair then we'll care then,
     Nae farther can we fa'.

     What tho', like commoners of air,
     We wander out, we know not where,
     But either house or hal',
     Yet nature's charms, the hills and woods,
     The sweeping vales, and foaming floods,
     Are free alike to all.
     In days when daisies deck the ground,
     And blackbirds whistle clear,
     With honest joy our hearts will bound,
     To see the coming year:
     On braes when we please, then,
     We'll sit an' sowth a tune;
     Syne rhyme till't we'll time till't,
     An' sing't when we hae done.

     It's no in titles nor in rank;
     It's no in wealth like Lon'on bank,
     To purchase peace and rest:
     It's no in makin' muckle, mair;
     It's no in books, it's no in lear,
     To make us truly blest:
     If happiness hae not her seat
     An' centre in the breast,
     We may be wise, or rich, or great,
     But never can be blest;
     Nae treasures, nor pleasures
     Could make us happy lang;
     The heart aye's the part aye
     That makes us right or wrang.

     Think ye, that sic as you and I,
     Wha drudge an' drive thro' wet and dry,
     Wi' never-ceasing toil;
     Think ye, are we less blest than they,
     Wha scarcely tent us in their way,
     As hardly worth their while?
     Alas! how aft in haughty mood,
     God's creatures they oppress!
     Or else, neglecting a' that's guid,
     They riot in excess!
     Baith careless and fearless
     Of either heaven or hell;
     Esteeming and deeming
     It's a' an idle tale!

     Then let us cheerfu' acquiesce,
     Nor make our scanty pleasures less,
     By pining at our state:
     And, even should misfortunes come,
     I, here wha sit, hae met wi' some—
     An's thankfu' for them yet.
     They gie the wit of age to youth;
     They let us ken oursel';
     They make us see the naked truth,
     The real guid and ill:
     Tho' losses an' crosses
     Be lessons right severe,
     There's wit there, ye'll get there,
     Ye'll find nae other where.

     But tent me, Davie, ace o' hearts!
     (To say aught less wad wrang the cartes,
     And flatt'ry I detest)
     This life has joys for you and I;
     An' joys that riches ne'er could buy,
     An' joys the very best.
     There's a' the pleasures o' the heart,
     The lover an' the frien';
     Ye hae your Meg, your dearest part,
     And I my darling Jean!
     It warms me, it charms me,
     To mention but her name:
     It heats me, it beets me,
     An' sets me a' on flame!

     O all ye Pow'rs who rule above!
     O Thou whose very self art love!
     Thou know'st my words sincere!
     The life-blood streaming thro' my heart,
     Or my more dear immortal part,
     Is not more fondly dear!
     When heart-corroding care and grief
     Deprive my soul of rest,
     Her dear idea brings relief,
     And solace to my breast.
     Thou Being, All-seeing,
     O hear my fervent pray'r;
     Still take her, and make her
     Thy most peculiar care!

     All hail! ye tender feelings dear!
     The smile of love, the friendly tear,
     The sympathetic glow!
     Long since, this world's thorny ways
     Had number'd out my weary days,
     Had it not been for you!
     Fate still has blest me with a friend,
     In ev'ry care and ill;
     And oft a more endearing band—
     A tie more tender still.
     It lightens, it brightens
     The tenebrific scene,
     To meet with, and greet with
     My Davie, or my Jean!

     O, how that name inspires my style!
     The words come skelpin, rank an' file,
     Amaist before I ken!
     The ready measure rins as fine,
     As Phoebus an' the famous Nine
     Were glowrin owre my pen.
     My spaviet Pegasus will limp,
     Till ance he's fairly het;
     And then he'll hilch, and stilt, an' jimp,
     And rin an unco fit:
     But least then the beast then
     Should rue this hasty ride,
     I'll light now, and dight now
     His sweaty, wizen'd hide.

    <h2>
      Holy Willie's Prayer
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     “And send the godly in a pet to pray.”—Pope.
</pre>
    <p>
      Argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holy Willie was a rather oldish bachelor elder, in the parish of
      Mauchline, and much and justly famed for that polemical chattering, which
      ends in tippling orthodoxy, and for that spiritualized bawdry which
      refines to liquorish devotion. In a sessional process with a gentleman in
      Mauchline—a Mr. Gavin Hamilton—Holy Willie and his priest,
      Father Auld, after full hearing in the presbytery of Ayr, came off but
      second best; owing partly to the oratorical powers of Mr. Robert Aiken,
      Mr. Hamilton's counsel; but chiefly to Mr. Hamilton's being one of the
      most irreproachable and truly respectable characters in the county. On
      losing the process, the muse overheard him [Holy Willie] at his devotions,
      as follows:—
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     O Thou, who in the heavens does dwell,
     Who, as it pleases best Thysel',
     Sends ane to heaven an' ten to hell,
     A' for Thy glory,
     And no for ony gude or ill
     They've done afore Thee!

     I bless and praise Thy matchless might,
     When thousands Thou hast left in night,
     That I am here afore Thy sight,
     For gifts an' grace
     A burning and a shining light
     To a' this place.

     What was I, or my generation,
     That I should get sic exaltation,
     I wha deserve most just damnation
     For broken laws,
     Five thousand years ere my creation,
     Thro' Adam's cause?

     When frae my mither's womb I fell,
     Thou might hae plunged me in hell,
     To gnash my gums, to weep and wail,
     In burnin lakes,
     Where damned devils roar and yell,
     Chain'd to their stakes.

     Yet I am here a chosen sample,
     To show thy grace is great and ample;
     I'm here a pillar o' Thy temple,
     Strong as a rock,
     A guide, a buckler, and example,
     To a' Thy flock.

     O Lord, Thou kens what zeal I bear,
     When drinkers drink, an' swearers swear,
     An' singin there, an' dancin here,
     Wi' great and sma';
     For I am keepit by Thy fear
     Free frae them a'.

     But yet, O Lord! confess I must,
     At times I'm fash'd wi' fleshly lust:
     An' sometimes, too, in wardly trust,
     Vile self gets in:
     But Thou remembers we are dust,
     Defil'd wi' sin.

     O Lord! yestreen, Thou kens, wi' Meg—
     Thy pardon I sincerely beg,
     O! may't ne'er be a livin plague
     To my dishonour,
     An' I'll ne'er lift a lawless leg
     Again upon her.

     Besides, I farther maun allow,
     Wi' Leezie's lass, three times I trow—
     But Lord, that Friday I was fou,
     When I cam near her;
     Or else, Thou kens, Thy servant true
     Wad never steer her.

     Maybe Thou lets this fleshly thorn
     Buffet Thy servant e'en and morn,
     Lest he owre proud and high shou'd turn,
     That he's sae gifted:
     If sae, Thy han' maun e'en be borne,
     Until Thou lift it.

     Lord, bless Thy chosen in this place,
     For here Thou hast a chosen race:
     But God confound their stubborn face,
     An' blast their name,
     Wha bring Thy elders to disgrace
     An' public shame.

     Lord, mind Gaw'n Hamilton's deserts;
     He drinks, an' swears, an' plays at cartes,
     Yet has sae mony takin arts,
     Wi' great and sma',
     Frae God's ain priest the people's hearts
     He steals awa.

     An' when we chasten'd him therefor,
     Thou kens how he bred sic a splore,
     An' set the warld in a roar
     O' laughing at us;—
     Curse Thou his basket and his store,
     Kail an' potatoes.

     Lord, hear my earnest cry and pray'r,
     Against that Presbyt'ry o' Ayr;
     Thy strong right hand, Lord, make it bare
     Upo' their heads;
     Lord visit them, an' dinna spare,
     For their misdeeds.

     O Lord, my God! that glib-tongu'd Aiken,
     My vera heart and flesh are quakin,
     To think how we stood sweatin', shakin,
     An' p-'d wi' dread,
     While he, wi' hingin lip an' snakin,
     Held up his head.

     Lord, in Thy day o' vengeance try him,
     Lord, visit them wha did employ him,
     And pass not in Thy mercy by 'em,
     Nor hear their pray'r,
     But for Thy people's sake, destroy 'em,
     An' dinna spare.

     But, Lord, remember me an' mine
     Wi' mercies temp'ral an' divine,
     That I for grace an' gear may shine,
     Excell'd by nane,
     And a' the glory shall be thine,
     Amen, Amen!

      Epitaph On Holy Willie

     Taks up its last abode;
     His saul has ta'en some other way,
     I fear, the left-hand road.

     Stop! there he is, as sure's a gun,
     Poor, silly body, see him;
     Nae wonder he's as black's the grun,
     Observe wha's standing wi' him.

     Your brunstane devilship, I see,
     Has got him there before ye;
     But haud your nine-tail cat a wee,
     Till ance you've heard my story.

     Your pity I will not implore,
     For pity ye have nane;
     Justice, alas! has gi'en him o'er,
     And mercy's day is gane.

    <h2>
      Death and Doctor Hornbook
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     A True Story
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Some books are lies frae end to end,
     And some great lies were never penn'd:
     Ev'n ministers they hae been kenn'd,
     In holy rapture,
     A rousing whid at times to vend,
     And nail't wi' Scripture.

     But this that I am gaun to tell,
     Which lately on a night befell,
     Is just as true's the Deil's in hell
     Or Dublin city:
     That e'er he nearer comes oursel'
     'S a muckle pity.

     The clachan yill had made me canty,
     I was na fou, but just had plenty;
     I stacher'd whiles, but yet too tent aye
     To free the ditches;
     An' hillocks, stanes, an' bushes, kenn'd eye
     Frae ghaists an' witches.

     The rising moon began to glowre
     The distant Cumnock hills out-owre:
     To count her horns, wi' a my pow'r,
     I set mysel';
     But whether she had three or four,
     I cou'd na tell.

     I was come round about the hill,
     An' todlin down on Willie's mill,
     Setting my staff wi' a' my skill,
     To keep me sicker;
     Tho' leeward whiles, against my will,
     I took a bicker.

     I there wi' Something did forgather,
     That pat me in an eerie swither;
     An' awfu' scythe, out-owre ae shouther,
     Clear-dangling, hang;
     A three-tae'd leister on the ither
     Lay, large an' lang.

     Its stature seem'd lang Scotch ells twa,
     The queerest shape that e'er I saw,
     For fient a wame it had ava;
     And then its shanks,
     They were as thin, as sharp an' sma'
     As cheeks o' branks.

     “Guid-een,” quo' I; “Friend! hae ye been mawin,
     When ither folk are busy sawin!”^1
     I seem'd to make a kind o' stan'
     But naething spak;
     At length, says I, “Friend! whare ye gaun?
     Will ye go back?”

     It spak right howe,—“My name is Death,
     But be na fley'd.”—Quoth I, “Guid faith,
     Ye're maybe come to stap my breath;
     But tent me, billie;
     I red ye weel, tak care o' skaith
     See, there's a gully!”

     “Gudeman,” quo' he, “put up your whittle,
     I'm no designed to try its mettle;
     But if I did, I wad be kittle
     To be mislear'd;
     I wad na mind it, no that spittle
     Out-owre my beard.”

     “Weel, weel!” says I, “a bargain be't;
     Come, gie's your hand, an' sae we're gree't;
     We'll ease our shanks an tak a seat—
     Come, gie's your news;
     This while ye hae been mony a gate,
     At mony a house.”^2

     [Footnote 1: This recontre happened in seed-time, 1785.—R.B.]

     [Footnote 2: An epidemical fever was then raging in that
      country.—R.B.]

     “Ay, ay!” quo' he, an' shook his head,
     “It's e'en a lang, lang time indeed
     Sin' I began to nick the thread,
     An' choke the breath:
     Folk maun do something for their bread,
     An' sae maun Death.

     “Sax thousand years are near-hand fled
     Sin' I was to the butching bred,
     An' mony a scheme in vain's been laid,
     To stap or scar me;
     Till ane Hornbook's^3 ta'en up the trade,
     And faith! he'll waur me.

     “Ye ken Hornbook i' the clachan,
     Deil mak his king's-hood in spleuchan!
     He's grown sae weel acquaint wi' Buchan^4
     And ither chaps,
     The weans haud out their fingers laughin,
     An' pouk my hips.

     “See, here's a scythe, an' there's dart,
     They hae pierc'd mony a gallant heart;
     But Doctor Hornbook, wi' his art
     An' cursed skill,
     Has made them baith no worth a f-t,
     Damn'd haet they'll kill!

     “'Twas but yestreen, nae farther gane,
     I threw a noble throw at ane;
     Wi' less, I'm sure, I've hundreds slain;
     But deil-ma-care,
     It just play'd dirl on the bane,
     But did nae mair.

     “Hornbook was by, wi' ready art,
     An' had sae fortify'd the part,

     [Footnote 3: This gentleman, Dr. Hornbook, is professionally
     a brother of the sovereign Order of the Ferula; but, by
     intuition and inspiration, is at once an apothecary,
     surgeon, and physician.—R.B.]

     [Footnote 4: Burchan's Domestic Medicine.—R.B.]

     That when I looked to my dart,
     It was sae blunt,
     Fient haet o't wad hae pierc'd the heart
     Of a kail-runt.

     “I drew my scythe in sic a fury,
     I near-hand cowpit wi' my hurry,
     But yet the bauld Apothecary
     Withstood the shock;
     I might as weel hae tried a quarry
     O' hard whin rock.

     “Ev'n them he canna get attended,
     Altho' their face he ne'er had kend it,
     Just—in a kail-blade, an' sent it,
     As soon's he smells 't,
     Baith their disease, and what will mend it,
     At once he tells 't.

     “And then, a' doctor's saws an' whittles,
     Of a' dimensions, shapes, an' mettles,
     A' kind o' boxes, mugs, an' bottles,
     He's sure to hae;
     Their Latin names as fast he rattles
     as A B C.

     “Calces o' fossils, earths, and trees;
     True sal-marinum o' the seas;
     The farina of beans an' pease,
     He has't in plenty;
     Aqua-fontis, what you please,
     He can content ye.

     “Forbye some new, uncommon weapons,
     Urinus spiritus of capons;
     Or mite-horn shavings, filings, scrapings,
     Distill'd per se;
     Sal-alkali o' midge-tail clippings,
     And mony mae.”

     “Waes me for Johnie Ged's^5 Hole now,”
      Quoth I, “if that thae news be true!
     His braw calf-ward whare gowans grew,
     Sae white and bonie,
     Nae doubt they'll rive it wi' the plew;
     They'll ruin Johnie!”

     The creature grain'd an eldritch laugh,
     And says “Ye needna yoke the pleugh,
     Kirkyards will soon be till'd eneugh,
     Tak ye nae fear:
     They'll be trench'd wi' mony a sheugh,
     In twa-three year.

     “Whare I kill'd ane, a fair strae-death,
     By loss o' blood or want of breath
     This night I'm free to tak my aith,
     That Hornbook's skill
     Has clad a score i' their last claith,
     By drap an' pill.

     “An honest wabster to his trade,
     Whase wife's twa nieves were scarce weel-bred
     Gat tippence-worth to mend her head,
     When it was sair;
     The wife slade cannie to her bed,
     But ne'er spak mair.

     “A country laird had ta'en the batts,
     Or some curmurring in his guts,
     His only son for Hornbook sets,
     An' pays him well:
     The lad, for twa guid gimmer-pets,
     Was laird himsel'.

     “A bonie lass—ye kend her name—
     Some ill-brewn drink had hov'd her wame;
     She trusts hersel', to hide the shame,
     In Hornbook's care;
     Horn sent her aff to her lang hame,
     To hide it there.

     [Footnote 5: The grave-digger.—R.B.]

     “That's just a swatch o' Hornbook's way;
     Thus goes he on from day to day,
     Thus does he poison, kill, an' slay,
     An's weel paid for't;
     Yet stops me o' my lawfu' prey,
     Wi' his damn'd dirt:

     “But, hark! I'll tell you of a plot,
     Tho' dinna ye be speakin o't;
     I'll nail the self-conceited sot,
     As dead's a herrin;
     Neist time we meet, I'll wad a groat,
     He gets his fairin!”

     But just as he began to tell,
     The auld kirk-hammer strak the bell
     Some wee short hour ayont the twal',
     Which rais'd us baith:
     I took the way that pleas'd mysel',
     And sae did Death.

    <h2>
      Epistle To J. Lapraik, An Old Scottish Bard
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     April 1, 1785

     While briers an' woodbines budding green,
     An' paitricks scraichin loud at e'en,
     An' morning poussie whiddin seen,
     Inspire my muse,
     This freedom, in an unknown frien',
     I pray excuse.

     On Fasten—e'en we had a rockin,
     To ca' the crack and weave our stockin;
     And there was muckle fun and jokin,
     Ye need na doubt;
     At length we had a hearty yokin
     At sang about.

     There was ae sang, amang the rest,
     Aboon them a' it pleas'd me best,
     That some kind husband had addrest
     To some sweet wife;
     It thirl'd the heart-strings thro' the breast,
     A' to the life.

     I've scarce heard ought describ'd sae weel,
     What gen'rous, manly bosoms feel;
     Thought I “Can this be Pope, or Steele,
     Or Beattie's wark?”
      They tauld me 'twas an odd kind chiel
     About Muirkirk.

     It pat me fidgin-fain to hear't,
     An' sae about him there I speir't;
     Then a' that kent him round declar'd
     He had ingine;
     That nane excell'd it, few cam near't,
     It was sae fine:

     That, set him to a pint of ale,
     An' either douce or merry tale,
     Or rhymes an' sangs he'd made himsel,
     Or witty catches—
     'Tween Inverness an' Teviotdale,
     He had few matches.

     Then up I gat, an' swoor an aith,
     Tho' I should pawn my pleugh an' graith,
     Or die a cadger pownie's death,
     At some dyke-back,
     A pint an' gill I'd gie them baith,
     To hear your crack.

     But, first an' foremost, I should tell,
     Amaist as soon as I could spell,
     I to the crambo-jingle fell;
     Tho' rude an' rough—
     Yet crooning to a body's sel'
     Does weel eneugh.

     I am nae poet, in a sense;
     But just a rhymer like by chance,
     An' hae to learning nae pretence;
     Yet, what the matter?
     Whene'er my muse does on me glance,
     I jingle at her.

     Your critic-folk may cock their nose,
     And say, “How can you e'er propose,
     You wha ken hardly verse frae prose,
     To mak a sang?”
      But, by your leaves, my learned foes,
     Ye're maybe wrang.

     What's a' your jargon o' your schools—
     Your Latin names for horns an' stools?
     If honest Nature made you fools,
     What sairs your grammars?
     Ye'd better taen up spades and shools,
     Or knappin-hammers.

     A set o' dull, conceited hashes
     Confuse their brains in college classes!
     They gang in stirks, and come out asses,
     Plain truth to speak;
     An' syne they think to climb Parnassus
     By dint o' Greek!

     Gie me ae spark o' nature's fire,
     That's a' the learning I desire;
     Then tho' I drudge thro' dub an' mire
     At pleugh or cart,
     My muse, tho' hamely in attire,
     May touch the heart.

     O for a spunk o' Allan's glee,
     Or Fergusson's the bauld an' slee,
     Or bright Lapraik's, my friend to be,
     If I can hit it!
     That would be lear eneugh for me,
     If I could get it.

     Now, sir, if ye hae friends enow,
     Tho' real friends, I b'lieve, are few;
     Yet, if your catalogue be fu',
     I'se no insist:
     But, gif ye want ae friend that's true,
     I'm on your list.

     I winna blaw about mysel,
     As ill I like my fauts to tell;
     But friends, an' folk that wish me well,
     They sometimes roose me;
     Tho' I maun own, as mony still
     As far abuse me.

     There's ae wee faut they whiles lay to me,
     I like the lasses—Gude forgie me!
     For mony a plack they wheedle frae me
     At dance or fair;
     Maybe some ither thing they gie me,
     They weel can spare.

     But Mauchline Race, or Mauchline Fair,
     I should be proud to meet you there;
     We'se gie ae night's discharge to care,
     If we forgather;
     An' hae a swap o' rhymin-ware
     Wi' ane anither.

     The four-gill chap, we'se gar him clatter,
     An' kirsen him wi' reekin water;
     Syne we'll sit down an' tak our whitter,
     To cheer our heart;
     An' faith, we'se be acquainted better
     Before we part.

     Awa ye selfish, war'ly race,
     Wha think that havins, sense, an' grace,
     Ev'n love an' friendship should give place
     To catch—the—plack!
     I dinna like to see your face,
     Nor hear your crack.

     But ye whom social pleasure charms
     Whose hearts the tide of kindness warms,
     Who hold your being on the terms,
     “Each aid the others,”
      Come to my bowl, come to my arms,
     My friends, my brothers!

     But, to conclude my lang epistle,
     As my auld pen's worn to the gristle,
     Twa lines frae you wad gar me fissle,
     Who am, most fervent,
     While I can either sing or whistle,
     Your friend and servant.

    <h2>
      Second Epistle To J. Lapraik
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     April 21, 1785

     While new-ca'd kye rowte at the stake
     An' pownies reek in pleugh or braik,
     This hour on e'enin's edge I take,
     To own I'm debtor
     To honest-hearted, auld Lapraik,
     For his kind letter.

     Forjesket sair, with weary legs,
     Rattlin the corn out-owre the rigs,
     Or dealing thro' amang the naigs
     Their ten-hours' bite,
     My awkart Muse sair pleads and begs
     I would na write.

     The tapetless, ramfeezl'd hizzie,
     She's saft at best an' something lazy:
     Quo' she, “Ye ken we've been sae busy
     This month an' mair,
     That trowth, my head is grown right dizzie,
     An' something sair.”

     Her dowff excuses pat me mad;
     “Conscience,” says I, “ye thowless jade!
     I'll write, an' that a hearty blaud,
     This vera night;
     So dinna ye affront your trade,
     But rhyme it right.

     “Shall bauld Lapraik, the king o' hearts,
     Tho' mankind were a pack o' cartes,
     Roose you sae weel for your deserts,
     In terms sae friendly;
     Yet ye'll neglect to shaw your parts
     An' thank him kindly?”

     Sae I gat paper in a blink,
     An' down gaed stumpie in the ink:
     Quoth I, “Before I sleep a wink,
     I vow I'll close it;
     An' if ye winna mak it clink,
     By Jove, I'll prose it!”

     Sae I've begun to scrawl, but whether
     In rhyme, or prose, or baith thegither;
     Or some hotch-potch that's rightly neither,
     Let time mak proof;
     But I shall scribble down some blether
     Just clean aff-loof.

     My worthy friend, ne'er grudge an' carp,
     Tho' fortune use you hard an' sharp;
     Come, kittle up your moorland harp
     Wi' gleesome touch!
     Ne'er mind how Fortune waft and warp;
     She's but a bitch.

     She 's gien me mony a jirt an' fleg,
     Sin' I could striddle owre a rig;
     But, by the Lord, tho' I should beg
     Wi' lyart pow,
     I'll laugh an' sing, an' shake my leg,
     As lang's I dow!

     Now comes the sax-an'-twentieth simmer
     I've seen the bud upon the timmer,
     Still persecuted by the limmer
     Frae year to year;
     But yet, despite the kittle kimmer,
     I, Rob, am here.

     Do ye envy the city gent,
     Behint a kist to lie an' sklent;
     Or pursue-proud, big wi' cent. per cent.
     An' muckle wame,
     In some bit brugh to represent
     A bailie's name?

     Or is't the paughty, feudal thane,
     Wi' ruffl'd sark an' glancing cane,
     Wha thinks himsel nae sheep-shank bane,
     But lordly stalks;
     While caps and bonnets aff are taen,
     As by he walks?

     “O Thou wha gies us each guid gift!
     Gie me o' wit an' sense a lift,
     Then turn me, if thou please, adrift,
     Thro' Scotland wide;
     Wi' cits nor lairds I wadna shift,
     In a' their pride!”

     Were this the charter of our state,
     “On pain o' hell be rich an' great,”
      Damnation then would be our fate,
     Beyond remead;
     But, thanks to heaven, that's no the gate
     We learn our creed.

     For thus the royal mandate ran,
     When first the human race began;
     “The social, friendly, honest man,
     Whate'er he be—
     'Tis he fulfils great Nature's plan,
     And none but he.”

     O mandate glorious and divine!
     The ragged followers o' the Nine,
     Poor, thoughtless devils! yet may shine
     In glorious light,
     While sordid sons o' Mammon's line
     Are dark as night!

     Tho' here they scrape, an' squeeze, an' growl,
     Their worthless nievefu' of a soul
     May in some future carcase howl,
     The forest's fright;
     Or in some day-detesting owl
     May shun the light.

     Then may Lapraik and Burns arise,
     To reach their native, kindred skies,
     And sing their pleasures, hopes an' joys,
     In some mild sphere;
     Still closer knit in friendship's ties,
     Each passing year!

    <h2>
      Epistle To William Simson
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Schoolmaster, Ochiltree.—May, 1785

     I gat your letter, winsome Willie;
     Wi' gratefu' heart I thank you brawlie;
     Tho' I maun say't, I wad be silly,
     And unco vain,
     Should I believe, my coaxin billie
     Your flatterin strain.

     But I'se believe ye kindly meant it:
     I sud be laith to think ye hinted
     Ironic satire, sidelins sklented
     On my poor Musie;
     Tho' in sic phraisin terms ye've penn'd it,
     I scarce excuse ye.

     My senses wad be in a creel,
     Should I but dare a hope to speel
     Wi' Allan, or wi' Gilbertfield,
     The braes o' fame;
     Or Fergusson, the writer-chiel,
     A deathless name.

     (O Fergusson! thy glorious parts
     Ill suited law's dry, musty arts!
     My curse upon your whunstane hearts,
     Ye E'nbrugh gentry!
     The tithe o' what ye waste at cartes
     Wad stow'd his pantry!)

     Yet when a tale comes i' my head,
     Or lassies gie my heart a screed—
     As whiles they're like to be my dead,
     (O sad disease!)
     I kittle up my rustic reed;
     It gies me ease.

     Auld Coila now may fidge fu' fain,
     She's gotten poets o' her ain;
     Chiels wha their chanters winna hain,
     But tune their lays,
     Till echoes a' resound again
     Her weel-sung praise.

     Nae poet thought her worth his while,
     To set her name in measur'd style;
     She lay like some unkenn'd-of-isle
     Beside New Holland,
     Or whare wild-meeting oceans boil
     Besouth Magellan.

     Ramsay an' famous Fergusson
     Gied Forth an' Tay a lift aboon;
     Yarrow an' Tweed, to monie a tune,
     Owre Scotland rings;
     While Irwin, Lugar, Ayr, an' Doon
     Naebody sings.

     Th' Illissus, Tiber, Thames, an' Seine,
     Glide sweet in monie a tunefu' line:
     But Willie, set your fit to mine,
     An' cock your crest;
     We'll gar our streams an' burnies shine
     Up wi' the best!

     We'll sing auld Coila's plains an' fells,
     Her moors red-brown wi' heather bells,
     Her banks an' braes, her dens and dells,
     Whare glorious Wallace
     Aft bure the gree, as story tells,
     Frae Suthron billies.

     At Wallace' name, what Scottish blood
     But boils up in a spring-tide flood!
     Oft have our fearless fathers strode
     By Wallace' side,
     Still pressing onward, red-wat-shod,
     Or glorious died!

     O, sweet are Coila's haughs an' woods,
     When lintwhites chant amang the buds,
     And jinkin hares, in amorous whids,
     Their loves enjoy;
     While thro' the braes the cushat croods
     With wailfu' cry!

     Ev'n winter bleak has charms to me,
     When winds rave thro' the naked tree;
     Or frosts on hills of Ochiltree
     Are hoary gray;
     Or blinding drifts wild-furious flee,
     Dark'ning the day!

     O Nature! a' thy shews an' forms
     To feeling, pensive hearts hae charms!
     Whether the summer kindly warms,
     Wi' life an light;
     Or winter howls, in gusty storms,
     The lang, dark night!

     The muse, nae poet ever fand her,
     Till by himsel he learn'd to wander,
     Adown some trottin burn's meander,
     An' no think lang:
     O sweet to stray, an' pensive ponder
     A heart-felt sang!

     The war'ly race may drudge an' drive,
     Hog-shouther, jundie, stretch, an' strive;
     Let me fair Nature's face descrive,
     And I, wi' pleasure,
     Shall let the busy, grumbling hive
     Bum owre their treasure.

     Fareweel, “my rhyme-composing” brither!
     We've been owre lang unkenn'd to ither:
     Now let us lay our heads thegither,
     In love fraternal:
     May envy wallop in a tether,
     Black fiend, infernal!

     While Highlandmen hate tools an' taxes;
     While moorlan's herds like guid, fat braxies;
     While terra firma, on her axis,
     Diurnal turns;
     Count on a friend, in faith an' practice,
     In Robert Burns.

    <h2>
      Postcript
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     My memory's no worth a preen;
     I had amaist forgotten clean,
     Ye bade me write you what they mean
     By this “new-light,”
      'Bout which our herds sae aft hae been
     Maist like to fight.

     In days when mankind were but callans
     At grammar, logic, an' sic talents,
     They took nae pains their speech to balance,
     Or rules to gie;
     But spak their thoughts in plain, braid lallans,
     Like you or me.

     In thae auld times, they thought the moon,
     Just like a sark, or pair o' shoon,
     Wore by degrees, till her last roon
     Gaed past their viewin;
     An' shortly after she was done
     They gat a new ane.

     This passed for certain, undisputed;
     It ne'er cam i' their heads to doubt it,
     Till chiels gat up an' wad confute it,
     An' ca'd it wrang;
     An' muckle din there was about it,
     Baith loud an' lang.

     Some herds, weel learn'd upo' the beuk,
     Wad threap auld folk the thing misteuk;
     For 'twas the auld moon turn'd a neuk
     An' out of' sight,
     An' backlins-comin to the leuk
     She grew mair bright.

     This was deny'd, it was affirm'd;
     The herds and hissels were alarm'd
     The rev'rend gray-beards rav'd an' storm'd,
     That beardless laddies
     Should think they better wer inform'd,
     Than their auld daddies.

     Frae less to mair, it gaed to sticks;
     Frae words an' aiths to clours an' nicks;
     An monie a fallow gat his licks,
     Wi' hearty crunt;
     An' some, to learn them for their tricks,
     Were hang'd an' brunt.

     This game was play'd in mony lands,
     An' auld-light caddies bure sic hands,
     That faith, the youngsters took the sands
     Wi' nimble shanks;
     Till lairds forbad, by strict commands,
     Sic bluidy pranks.

     But new-light herds gat sic a cowe,
     Folk thought them ruin'd stick-an-stowe;
     Till now, amaist on ev'ry knowe
     Ye'll find ane plac'd;
     An' some their new-light fair avow,
     Just quite barefac'd.

     Nae doubt the auld-light flocks are bleatin;
     Their zealous herds are vex'd an' sweatin;
     Mysel', I've even seen them greetin
     Wi' girnin spite,
     To hear the moon sae sadly lied on
     By word an' write.

     But shortly they will cowe the louns!
     Some auld-light herds in neebor touns
     Are mind't, in things they ca' balloons,
     To tak a flight;
     An' stay ae month amang the moons
     An' see them right.

     Guid observation they will gie them;
     An' when the auld moon's gaun to lea'e them,
     The hindmaist shaird, they'll fetch it wi' them
     Just i' their pouch;
     An' when the new-light billies see them,
     I think they'll crouch!

     Sae, ye observe that a' this clatter
     Is naething but a “moonshine matter”;
     But tho' dull prose-folk Latin splatter
     In logic tulyie,
     I hope we bardies ken some better
     Than mind sic brulyie.

      Epistle To John Goldie, In Kilmarnock
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Author Of The Gospel Recovered.—August, 1785

     O Gowdie, terror o' the whigs,
     Dread o' blackcoats and rev'rend wigs!
     Sour Bigotry, on her last legs,
     Girns an' looks back,
     Wishing the ten Egyptian plagues
     May seize you quick.

     Poor gapin', glowrin' Superstition!
     Wae's me, she's in a sad condition:
     Fye: bring Black Jock,^1 her state physician,
     To see her water;
     Alas, there's ground for great suspicion
     She'll ne'er get better.

     Enthusiasm's past redemption,
     Gane in a gallopin' consumption:
     Not a' her quacks, wi' a' their gumption,
     Can ever mend her;
     Her feeble pulse gies strong presumption,
     She'll soon surrender.

     Auld Orthodoxy lang did grapple,
     For every hole to get a stapple;
     But now she fetches at the thrapple,
     An' fights for breath;
     Haste, gie her name up in the chapel,^2
     Near unto death.

     It's you an' Taylor^3 are the chief
     To blame for a' this black mischief;

     [Footnote 1: The Rev. J. Russell, Kilmarnock.—R. B.]

     [Footnote 2: Mr. Russell's Kirk.—R. B.]

     [Footnote 3: Dr. Taylor of Norwich.—R. B.]

     But, could the Lord's ain folk get leave,
     A toom tar barrel
     An' twa red peats wad bring relief,
     And end the quarrel.

     For me, my skill's but very sma',
     An' skill in prose I've nane ava';
     But quietlins-wise, between us twa,
     Weel may you speed!
     And tho' they sud your sair misca',
     Ne'er fash your head.

     E'en swinge the dogs, and thresh them sicker!
     The mair they squeel aye chap the thicker;
     And still 'mang hands a hearty bicker
     O' something stout;
     It gars an owthor's pulse beat quicker,
     And helps his wit.

     There's naething like the honest nappy;
     Whare'll ye e'er see men sae happy,
     Or women sonsie, saft an' sappy,
     'Tween morn and morn,
     As them wha like to taste the drappie,
     In glass or horn?

     I've seen me dazed upon a time,
     I scarce could wink or see a styme;
     Just ae half-mutchkin does me prime,—
     Ought less is little—
     Then back I rattle on the rhyme,
     As gleg's a whittle.

      The Holy Fair^1
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     A robe of seeming truth and trust
     Hid crafty Observation;
     And secret hung, with poison'd crust,
     The dirk of Defamation:

     [Footnote 1: “Holy Fair” is a common phrase in the west of Scotland
      for a sacramental occasion.—R. B.]

     A mask that like the gorget show'd,
     Dye-varying on the pigeon;

     Hypocrisy A-La-Mode

     Upon a simmer Sunday morn
     When Nature's face is fair,
     I walked forth to view the corn,
     An' snuff the caller air.
     The rising sun owre Galston muirs
     Wi' glorious light was glintin;
     The hares were hirplin down the furrs,
     The lav'rocks they were chantin
     Fu' sweet that day.

     As lightsomely I glowr'd abroad,
     To see a scene sae gay,
     Three hizzies, early at the road,
     Cam skelpin up the way.
     Twa had manteeles o' dolefu' black,
     But ane wi' lyart lining;
     The third, that gaed a wee a-back,
     Was in the fashion shining
     Fu' gay that day.

     The twa appear'd like sisters twin,
     In feature, form, an' claes;
     Their visage wither'd, lang an' thin,
     An' sour as only slaes:
     The third cam up, hap-stap-an'-lowp,
     As light as ony lambie,
     An' wi'a curchie low did stoop,
     As soon as e'er she saw me,
     Fu' kind that day.

     Wi' bonnet aff, quoth I, “Sweet lass,
     I think ye seem to ken me;
     I'm sure I've seen that bonie face
     But yet I canna name ye.”
      Quo' she, an' laughin as she spak,
     An' taks me by the han's,
     “Ye, for my sake, hae gien the feck
     Of a' the ten comman's
     A screed some day.”

     “My name is Fun—your cronie dear,
     The nearest friend ye hae;
     An' this is Superstitution here,
     An' that's Hypocrisy.
     I'm gaun to Mauchline Holy Fair,
     To spend an hour in daffin:
     Gin ye'll go there, yon runkl'd pair,
     We will get famous laughin
     At them this day.”

     Quoth I, “Wi' a' my heart, I'll do't;
     I'll get my Sunday's sark on,
     An' meet you on the holy spot;
     Faith, we'se hae fine remarkin!”
      Then I gaed hame at crowdie-time,
     An' soon I made me ready;
     For roads were clad, frae side to side,
     Wi' mony a weary body
     In droves that day.

     Here farmers gash, in ridin graith,
     Gaed hoddin by their cotters;
     There swankies young, in braw braid-claith,
     Are springing owre the gutters.
     The lasses, skelpin barefit, thrang,
     In silks an' scarlets glitter;
     Wi' sweet-milk cheese, in mony a whang,
     An' farls, bak'd wi' butter,
     Fu' crump that day.

     When by the plate we set our nose,
     Weel heaped up wi' ha'pence,
     A greedy glowr black-bonnet throws,
     An' we maun draw our tippence.
     Then in we go to see the show:
     On ev'ry side they're gath'rin;
     Some carrying dails, some chairs an' stools,
     An' some are busy bleth'rin
     Right loud that day.

     Here stands a shed to fend the show'rs,
     An' screen our countra gentry;
     There Racer Jess,^2 an' twa-three whores,
     Are blinkin at the entry.
     Here sits a raw o' tittlin jads,
     Wi' heaving breast an' bare neck;
     An' there a batch o' wabster lads,
     Blackguarding frae Kilmarnock,
     For fun this day.

     Here, some are thinkin on their sins,
     An' some upo' their claes;
     Ane curses feet that fyl'd his shins,
     Anither sighs an' prays:
     On this hand sits a chosen swatch,
     Wi' screwed-up, grace-proud faces;
     On that a set o' chaps, at watch,
     Thrang winkin on the lasses
     To chairs that day.

     O happy is that man, an' blest!
     Nae wonder that it pride him!
     Whase ain dear lass, that he likes best,
     Comes clinkin down beside him!
     Wi' arms repos'd on the chair back,
     He sweetly does compose him;
     Which, by degrees, slips round her neck,
     An's loof upon her bosom,
     Unkend that day.

     Now a' the congregation o'er
     Is silent expectation;
     For Moodie^3 speels the holy door,
     Wi' tidings o' damnation:

     [Footnote 2: Racer Jess (d. 1813) was a half-witted daughter of
      Possie Nansie. She was a great pedestrian.]

     [Footnote 3: Rev. Alexander Moodie of Riccarton.]

     Should Hornie, as in ancient days,
     'Mang sons o' God present him,
     The vera sight o' Moodie's face,
     To 's ain het hame had sent him
     Wi' fright that day.

     Hear how he clears the point o' faith
     Wi' rattlin and wi' thumpin!
     Now meekly calm, now wild in wrath,
     He's stampin, an' he's jumpin!
     His lengthen'd chin, his turned-up snout,
     His eldritch squeel an' gestures,
     O how they fire the heart devout,
     Like cantharidian plaisters
     On sic a day!

     But hark! the tent has chang'd its voice,
     There's peace an' rest nae langer;
     For a' the real judges rise,
     They canna sit for anger,
     Smith^4 opens out his cauld harangues,
     On practice and on morals;
     An' aff the godly pour in thrangs,
     To gie the jars an' barrels
     A lift that day.

     What signifies his barren shine,
     Of moral powers an' reason?
     His English style, an' gesture fine
     Are a' clean out o' season.
     Like Socrates or Antonine,
     Or some auld pagan heathen,
     The moral man he does define,
     But ne'er a word o' faith in
     That's right that day.

     In guid time comes an antidote
     Against sic poison'd nostrum;
     For Peebles,^5 frae the water-fit,
     Ascends the holy rostrum:

     [Footnote 4: Rev. George Smith of Galston.]

     [Footnote 5: Rev. Wm. Peebles of Newton-upon-Ayr.]

     See, up he's got, the word o' God,
     An' meek an' mim has view'd it,
     While Common-sense has taen the road,
     An' aff, an' up the Cowgate^6
     Fast, fast that day.

     Wee Miller^7 neist the guard relieves,
     An' Orthodoxy raibles,
     Tho' in his heart he weel believes,
     An' thinks it auld wives' fables:
     But faith! the birkie wants a manse,
     So, cannilie he hums them;
     Altho' his carnal wit an' sense
     Like hafflins-wise o'ercomes him
     At times that day.

     Now, butt an' ben, the change-house fills,
     Wi' yill-caup commentators;
     Here 's cryin out for bakes and gills,
     An' there the pint-stowp clatters;
     While thick an' thrang, an' loud an' lang,
     Wi' logic an' wi' scripture,
     They raise a din, that in the end
     Is like to breed a rupture
     O' wrath that day.

     Leeze me on drink! it gies us mair
     Than either school or college;
     It kindles wit, it waukens lear,
     It pangs us fou o' knowledge:
     Be't whisky-gill or penny wheep,
     Or ony stronger potion,
     It never fails, or drinkin deep,
     To kittle up our notion,
     By night or day.

     The lads an' lasses, blythely bent
     To mind baith saul an' body,
     Sit round the table, weel content,
     An' steer about the toddy:

     [Footnote 6: A street so called which faces the tent in
      Mauchline.—R. B.]

     [Footnote 7: Rev. Alex. Miller, afterward of Kilmaurs.]

     On this ane's dress, an' that ane's leuk,
     They're makin observations;
     While some are cozie i' the neuk,
     An' forming assignations
     To meet some day.

     But now the Lord's ain trumpet touts,
     Till a' the hills are rairin,
     And echoes back return the shouts;
     Black Russell is na sparin:
     His piercin words, like Highlan' swords,
     Divide the joints an' marrow;
     His talk o' Hell, whare devils dwell,
     Our vera “sauls does harrow”
      Wi' fright that day!

     A vast, unbottom'd, boundless pit,
     Fill'd fou o' lowin brunstane,
     Whase raging flame, an' scorching heat,
     Wad melt the hardest whun-stane!
     The half-asleep start up wi' fear,
     An' think they hear it roarin;
     When presently it does appear,
     'Twas but some neibor snorin
     Asleep that day.

     'Twad be owre lang a tale to tell,
     How mony stories past;
     An' how they crouded to the yill,
     When they were a' dismist;
     How drink gaed round, in cogs an' caups,
     Amang the furms an' benches;
     An' cheese an' bread, frae women's laps,
     Was dealt about in lunches
     An' dawds that day.

     In comes a gawsie, gash guidwife,
     An' sits down by the fire,
     Syne draws her kebbuck an' her knife;
     The lasses they are shyer:
     The auld guidmen, about the grace
     Frae side to side they bother;
     Till some ane by his bonnet lays,
     An' gies them't like a tether,
     Fu' lang that day.

     Waesucks! for him that gets nae lass,
     Or lasses that hae naething!
     Sma' need has he to say a grace,
     Or melvie his braw claithing!
     O wives, be mindfu' ance yoursel'
     How bonie lads ye wanted;
     An' dinna for a kebbuck-heel
     Let lasses be affronted
     On sic a day!

     Now Clinkumbell, wi' rattlin tow,
     Begins to jow an' croon;
     Some swagger hame the best they dow,
     Some wait the afternoon.
     At slaps the billies halt a blink,
     Till lasses strip their shoon:
     Wi' faith an' hope, an' love an' drink,
     They're a' in famous tune
     For crack that day.

     How mony hearts this day converts
     O' sinners and o' lasses!
     Their hearts o' stane, gin night, are gane
     As saft as ony flesh is:
     There's some are fou o' love divine;
     There's some are fou o' brandy;
     An' mony jobs that day begin,
     May end in houghmagandie
     Some ither day.

      Third Epistle To J. Lapraik
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Guid speed and furder to you, Johnie,
     Guid health, hale han's, an' weather bonie;
     Now, when ye're nickin down fu' cannie
     The staff o' bread,
     May ye ne'er want a stoup o' bran'y
     To clear your head.

     May Boreas never thresh your rigs,
     Nor kick your rickles aff their legs,
     Sendin the stuff o'er muirs an' haggs
     Like drivin wrack;
     But may the tapmost grain that wags
     Come to the sack.

     I'm bizzie, too, an' skelpin at it,
     But bitter, daudin showers hae wat it;
     Sae my auld stumpie pen I gat it
     Wi' muckle wark,
     An' took my jocteleg an whatt it,
     Like ony clark.

     It's now twa month that I'm your debtor,
     For your braw, nameless, dateless letter,
     Abusin me for harsh ill-nature
     On holy men,
     While deil a hair yoursel' ye're better,
     But mair profane.

     But let the kirk-folk ring their bells,
     Let's sing about our noble sel's:
     We'll cry nae jads frae heathen hills
     To help, or roose us;
     But browster wives an' whisky stills,
     They are the muses.

     Your friendship, Sir, I winna quat it,
     An' if ye mak' objections at it,
     Then hand in neive some day we'll knot it,
     An' witness take,
     An' when wi' usquabae we've wat it
     It winna break.

     But if the beast an' branks be spar'd
     Till kye be gaun without the herd,
     And a' the vittel in the yard,
     An' theekit right,
     I mean your ingle-side to guard
     Ae winter night.

     Then muse-inspirin' aqua-vitae
     Shall make us baith sae blythe and witty,
     Till ye forget ye're auld an' gatty,
     An' be as canty
     As ye were nine years less than thretty—
     Sweet ane an' twenty!

     But stooks are cowpit wi' the blast,
     And now the sinn keeks in the west,
     Then I maun rin amang the rest,
     An' quat my chanter;
     Sae I subscribe myself' in haste,
     Yours, Rab the Ranter.

    <h2>
      Epistle To The Rev. John M'math
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Sept. 13, 1785.

     Inclosing A Copy Of “Holy Willie's Prayer,”
      Which He Had Requested, Sept. 17, 1785

     While at the stook the shearers cow'r
     To shun the bitter blaudin' show'r,
     Or in gulravage rinnin scowr
     To pass the time,
     To you I dedicate the hour
     In idle rhyme.

     My musie, tir'd wi' mony a sonnet
     On gown, an' ban', an' douse black bonnet,
     Is grown right eerie now she's done it,
     Lest they should blame her,
     An' rouse their holy thunder on it
     An anathem her.

     I own 'twas rash, an' rather hardy,
     That I, a simple, country bardie,
     Should meddle wi' a pack sae sturdy,
     Wha, if they ken me,
     Can easy, wi' a single wordie,
     Lowse hell upon me.

     But I gae mad at their grimaces,
     Their sighin, cantin, grace-proud faces,
     Their three-mile prayers, an' half-mile graces,
     Their raxin conscience,
     Whase greed, revenge, an' pride disgraces
     Waur nor their nonsense.

     There's Gaw'n, misca'd waur than a beast,
     Wha has mair honour in his breast
     Than mony scores as guid's the priest
     Wha sae abus'd him:
     And may a bard no crack his jest
     What way they've us'd him?

     See him, the poor man's friend in need,
     The gentleman in word an' deed—
     An' shall his fame an' honour bleed
     By worthless, skellums,
     An' not a muse erect her head
     To cowe the blellums?

     O Pope, had I thy satire's darts
     To gie the rascals their deserts,
     I'd rip their rotten, hollow hearts,
     An' tell aloud
     Their jugglin hocus-pocus arts
     To cheat the crowd.

     God knows, I'm no the thing I should be,
     Nor am I even the thing I could be,
     But twenty times I rather would be
     An atheist clean,
     Than under gospel colours hid be
     Just for a screen.

     An honest man may like a glass,
     An honest man may like a lass,
     But mean revenge, an' malice fause
     He'll still disdain,
     An' then cry zeal for gospel laws,
     Like some we ken.

     They take religion in their mouth;
     They talk o' mercy, grace, an' truth,
     For what?—to gie their malice skouth
     On some puir wight,
     An' hunt him down, owre right and ruth,
     To ruin straight.

     All hail, Religion! maid divine!
     Pardon a muse sae mean as mine,
     Who in her rough imperfect line
     Thus daurs to name thee;
     To stigmatise false friends of thine
     Can ne'er defame thee.

     Tho' blotch't and foul wi' mony a stain,
     An' far unworthy of thy train,
     With trembling voice I tune my strain,
     To join with those
     Who boldly dare thy cause maintain
     In spite of foes:

     In spite o' crowds, in spite o' mobs,
     In spite o' undermining jobs,
     In spite o' dark banditti stabs
     At worth an' merit,
     By scoundrels, even wi' holy robes,
     But hellish spirit.

     O Ayr! my dear, my native ground,
     Within thy presbyterial bound
     A candid liberal band is found
     Of public teachers,
     As men, as Christians too, renown'd,
     An' manly preachers.

     Sir, in that circle you are nam'd;
     Sir, in that circle you are fam'd;
     An' some, by whom your doctrine's blam'd
     (Which gies you honour)
     Even, sir, by them your heart's esteem'd,
     An' winning manner.

     Pardon this freedom I have ta'en,
     An' if impertinent I've been,
     Impute it not, good Sir, in ane
     Whase heart ne'er wrang'd ye,
     But to his utmost would befriend
     Ought that belang'd ye.

      Second Epistle to Davie
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     A Brother Poet

     Auld Neibour,
     I'm three times doubly o'er your debtor,
     For your auld-farrant, frien'ly letter;
     Tho' I maun say't I doubt ye flatter,
     Ye speak sae fair;
     For my puir, silly, rhymin clatter
     Some less maun sair.

     Hale be your heart, hale be your fiddle,
     Lang may your elbuck jink diddle,
     To cheer you thro' the weary widdle
     O' war'ly cares;
     Till barins' barins kindly cuddle
     Your auld grey hairs.

     But Davie, lad, I'm red ye're glaikit;
     I'm tauld the muse ye hae negleckit;
     An, gif it's sae, ye sud by lickit
     Until ye fyke;
     Sic haun's as you sud ne'er be faikit,
     Be hain't wha like.

     For me, I'm on Parnassus' brink,
     Rivin the words to gar them clink;
     Whiles dazed wi' love, whiles dazed wi' drink,
     Wi' jads or masons;
     An' whiles, but aye owre late, I think
     Braw sober lessons.

     Of a' the thoughtless sons o' man,
     Commen' to me the bardie clan;
     Except it be some idle plan
     O' rhymin clink,
     The devil haet,—that I sud ban—
     They ever think.

     Nae thought, nae view, nae scheme o' livin,
     Nae cares to gie us joy or grievin,
     But just the pouchie put the neive in,
     An' while ought's there,
     Then, hiltie, skiltie, we gae scrievin',
     An' fash nae mair.

     Leeze me on rhyme! it's aye a treasure,
     My chief, amaist my only pleasure;
     At hame, a-fiel', at wark, or leisure,
     The Muse, poor hizzie!
     Tho' rough an' raploch be her measure,
     She's seldom lazy.

     Haud to the Muse, my daintie Davie:
     The warl' may play you mony a shavie;
     But for the Muse, she'll never leave ye,
     Tho' e'er sae puir,
     Na, even tho' limpin wi' the spavie
     Frae door tae door.

      Song—Young Peggy Blooms
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Tune—“Loch Eroch-side.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Young Peggy blooms our boniest lass,
     Her blush is like the morning,
     The rosy dawn, the springing grass,
     With early gems adorning.
     Her eyes outshine the radiant beams
     That gild the passing shower,
     And glitter o'er the crystal streams,
     And cheer each fresh'ning flower.

     Her lips, more than the cherries bright,
     A richer dye has graced them;
     They charm th' admiring gazer's sight,
     And sweetly tempt to taste them;
     Her smile is as the evening mild,
     When feather'd pairs are courting,
     And little lambkins wanton wild,
     In playful bands disporting.

     Were Fortune lovely Peggy's foe,
     Such sweetness would relent her;
     As blooming spring unbends the brow
     Of surly, savage Winter.
     Detraction's eye no aim can gain,
     Her winning pow'rs to lessen;
     And fretful Envy grins in vain
     The poison'd tooth to fasten.

     Ye Pow'rs of Honour, Love, and Truth,
     From ev'ry ill defend her!
     Inspire the highly-favour'd youth
     The destinies intend her:
     Still fan the sweet connubial flame
     Responsive in each bosom;
     And bless the dear parental name
     With many a filial blossom.

      Halloween^1
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     [Footnote 1: Is thought to be a night when witches, devils,
     and other mischief-making beings are abroad on their baneful
     midnight errands; particularly those aerial people, the
     fairies, are said on that night to hold a grand
     anniversary,.—R.B.]
</pre>
    <p>
      The following poem will, by many readers, be well enough understood; but
      for the sake of those who are unacquainted with the manners and traditions
      of the country where the scene is cast, notes are added to give some
      account of the principal charms and spells of that night, so big with
      prophecy to the peasantry in the west of Scotland. The passion of prying
      into futurity makes a striking part of the history of human nature in its
      rude state, in all ages and nations; and it may be some entertainment to a
      philosophic mind, if any such honour the author with a perusal, to see the
      remains of it among the more unenlightened in our own.—R.B.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Yes! let the rich deride, the proud disdain,
     The simple pleasure of the lowly train;
     To me more dear, congenial to my heart,
     One native charm, than all the gloss of art.—Goldsmith.

     Upon that night, when fairies light
     On Cassilis Downans^2 dance,
     Or owre the lays, in splendid blaze,
     On sprightly coursers prance;
     Or for Colean the rout is ta'en,
     Beneath the moon's pale beams;
     There, up the Cove,^3 to stray an' rove,
     Amang the rocks and streams
     To sport that night;

     [Footnote 2: Certain little, romantic, rocky, green hills,
     in the neighbourhood of the ancient seat of the Earls of
     Cassilis.—R.B.]

     [Footnote 3: A noted cavern near Colean house, called the
     Cove of Colean; which, as well as Cassilis Downans, is
     famed, in country story, for being a favorite haunt of
     fairies.—R.B.]

     Amang the bonie winding banks,
     Where Doon rins, wimplin, clear;
     Where Bruce^4 ance rul'd the martial ranks,
     An' shook his Carrick spear;
     Some merry, friendly, countra-folks
     Together did convene,
     To burn their nits, an' pou their stocks,
     An' haud their Halloween
     Fu' blythe that night.

     [Footnote 4: The famous family of that name, the ancestors
     of Robert, the great deliverer of his country, were Earls of
     Carrick.—R.B.]

     The lasses feat, an' cleanly neat,
     Mair braw than when they're fine;
     Their faces blythe, fu' sweetly kythe,
     Hearts leal, an' warm, an' kin':
     The lads sae trig, wi' wooer-babs
     Weel-knotted on their garten;
     Some unco blate, an' some wi' gabs
     Gar lasses' hearts gang startin
     Whiles fast at night.

     Then, first an' foremost, thro' the kail,
     Their stocks^5 maun a' be sought ance;

     [Footnote 5: The first ceremony of Halloween is pulling each
     a “stock,” or plant of kail. They must go out, hand in hand,
     with eyes shut, and pull the first they meet with: its being
     big or little, straight or crooked, is prophetic of the size
     and shape of the grand object of all their spells—the
     husband or wife. If any “yird,” or earth, stick to the root,
     that is “tocher,” or fortune; and the taste of the
     “custock,” that is, the heart of the stem, is indicative of
     the natural temper and disposition. Lastly, the stems, or,
     to give them their ordinary appellation, the “runts,” are
     placed somewhere above the head of the door; and the
     Christian names of the people whom chance brings into the
     house are, according to the priority of placing the “runts,”
      the names in question.—R. B.]

     They steek their een, and grape an' wale
     For muckle anes, an' straught anes.
     Poor hav'rel Will fell aff the drift,
     An' wandered thro' the bow-kail,
     An' pou't for want o' better shift
     A runt was like a sow-tail
     Sae bow't that night.

     Then, straught or crooked, yird or nane,
     They roar an' cry a' throu'ther;
     The vera wee-things, toddlin, rin,
     Wi' stocks out owre their shouther:
     An' gif the custock's sweet or sour,
     Wi' joctelegs they taste them;
     Syne coziely, aboon the door,
     Wi' cannie care, they've plac'd them
     To lie that night.

     The lassies staw frae 'mang them a',
     To pou their stalks o' corn;^6
     But Rab slips out, an' jinks about,
     Behint the muckle thorn:
     He grippit Nelly hard and fast:
     Loud skirl'd a' the lasses;
     But her tap-pickle maist was lost,
     Whan kiutlin in the fause-house^7
     Wi' him that night.

     [Footnote 6: They go to the barnyard, and pull each, at
     three different times, a stalk of oats. If the third stalk
     wants the “top-pickle,” that is, the grain at the top of the
     stalk, the party in question will come to the marriage-bed
     anything but a maid.—R.B.]

     [Footnote 7: When the corn is in a doubtful state, by being
     too green or wet, the stack-builder, by means of old timber,
     etc., makes a large apartment in his stack, with an opening
     in the side which is fairest exposed to the wind: this he
     calls a “fause-house.”—R.B.]

     The auld guid-wife's weel-hoordit nits^8
     Are round an' round dividend,
     An' mony lads an' lasses' fates
     Are there that night decided:
     Some kindle couthie side by side,
     And burn thegither trimly;
     Some start awa wi' saucy pride,
     An' jump out owre the chimlie
     Fu' high that night.

     [Footnote 8: Burning the nuts is a favorite charm. They name
     the lad and lass to each particular nut, as they lay them in
     the fire; and according as they burn quietly together, or
     start from beside one another, the course and issue of the
     courtship will be.—R.B.]

     Jean slips in twa, wi' tentie e'e;
     Wha 'twas, she wadna tell;
     But this is Jock, an' this is me,
     She says in to hersel':
     He bleez'd owre her, an' she owre him,
     As they wad never mair part:
     Till fuff! he started up the lum,
     An' Jean had e'en a sair heart
     To see't that night.

     Poor Willie, wi' his bow-kail runt,
     Was brunt wi' primsie Mallie;
     An' Mary, nae doubt, took the drunt,
     To be compar'd to Willie:
     Mall's nit lap out, wi' pridefu' fling,
     An' her ain fit, it brunt it;
     While Willie lap, and swore by jing,
     'Twas just the way he wanted
     To be that night.

     Nell had the fause-house in her min',
     She pits hersel an' Rob in;
     In loving bleeze they sweetly join,
     Till white in ase they're sobbin:
     Nell's heart was dancin at the view;
     She whisper'd Rob to leuk for't:
     Rob, stownlins, prie'd her bonie mou',
     Fu' cozie in the neuk for't,
     Unseen that night.

     But Merran sat behint their backs,
     Her thoughts on Andrew Bell:
     She lea'es them gashin at their cracks,
     An' slips out—by hersel';
     She thro' the yard the nearest taks,
     An' for the kiln she goes then,
     An' darklins grapit for the bauks,
     And in the blue-clue^9 throws then,
     Right fear't that night.

     [Footnote 9: Whoever would, with success, try this spell,
     must strictly observe these directions: Steal out, all
     alone, to the kiln, and darkling, throw into the “pot” a
     clue of blue yarn; wind it in a new clue off the old one;
     and, toward the latter end, something will hold the thread:
     demand, “Wha hauds?” i.e., who holds? and answer will be
     returned from the kiln-pot, by naming the Christian and
     surname of your future spouse.—R.B.]

     An' ay she win't, an' ay she swat—
     I wat she made nae jaukin;
     Till something held within the pat,
     Good Lord! but she was quaukin!
     But whether 'twas the deil himsel,
     Or whether 'twas a bauk-en',
     Or whether it was Andrew Bell,
     She did na wait on talkin
     To spier that night.

     Wee Jenny to her graunie says,
     “Will ye go wi' me, graunie?
     I'll eat the apple at the glass,^10
     I gat frae uncle Johnie:”
      She fuff't her pipe wi' sic a lunt,
     In wrath she was sae vap'rin,
     She notic't na an aizle brunt
     Her braw, new, worset apron
     Out thro' that night.

     [Footnote 10: Take a candle and go alone to a looking-glass;
     eat an apple before it, and some traditions say you should
     comb your hair all the time; the face of your conjungal
     companion, to be, will be seen in the glass, as if peeping
     over your shoulder.—R.B.]

     “Ye little skelpie-limmer's face!
     I daur you try sic sportin,
     As seek the foul thief ony place,
     For him to spae your fortune:
     Nae doubt but ye may get a sight!
     Great cause ye hae to fear it;
     For mony a ane has gotten a fright,
     An' liv'd an' died deleerit,
     On sic a night.

     “Ae hairst afore the Sherra-moor,
     I mind't as weel's yestreen—
     I was a gilpey then, I'm sure
     I was na past fyfteen:
     The simmer had been cauld an' wat,
     An' stuff was unco green;
     An' eye a rantin kirn we gat,
     An' just on Halloween
     It fell that night.

     “Our stibble-rig was Rab M'Graen,
     A clever, sturdy fallow;
     His sin gat Eppie Sim wi' wean,
     That lived in Achmacalla:
     He gat hemp-seed,^11 I mind it weel,
     An'he made unco light o't;
     But mony a day was by himsel',
     He was sae sairly frighted
     That vera night.”

     [Footnote 11: Steal out, unperceived, and sow a handful of
     hemp-seed, harrowing it with anything you can conveniently
     draw after you. Repeat now and then: “Hemp-seed, I saw thee,
     hemp-seed, I saw thee; and him (or her) that is to be my
     true love, come after me and pou thee.” Look over your left
     shoulder, and you will see the appearance of the person
     invoked, in the attitude of pulling hemp. Some traditions
     say, “Come after me and shaw thee,” that is, show thyself;
     in which case, it simply appears. Others omit the harrowing,
     and say: “Come after me and harrow thee.”—R.B.]

     Then up gat fechtin Jamie Fleck,
     An' he swoor by his conscience,
     That he could saw hemp-seed a peck;
     For it was a' but nonsense:
     The auld guidman raught down the pock,
     An' out a handfu' gied him;
     Syne bad him slip frae' mang the folk,
     Sometime when nae ane see'd him,
     An' try't that night.

     He marches thro' amang the stacks,
     Tho' he was something sturtin;
     The graip he for a harrow taks,
     An' haurls at his curpin:
     And ev'ry now an' then, he says,
     “Hemp-seed I saw thee,
     An' her that is to be my lass
     Come after me, an' draw thee
     As fast this night.”

     He wistl'd up Lord Lennox' March
     To keep his courage cherry;
     Altho' his hair began to arch,
     He was sae fley'd an' eerie:
     Till presently he hears a squeak,
     An' then a grane an' gruntle;
     He by his shouther gae a keek,
     An' tumbled wi' a wintle
     Out-owre that night.

     He roar'd a horrid murder-shout,
     In dreadfu' desperation!
     An' young an' auld come rinnin out,
     An' hear the sad narration:
     He swoor 'twas hilchin Jean M'Craw,
     Or crouchie Merran Humphie—
     Till stop! she trotted thro' them a';
     And wha was it but grumphie
     Asteer that night!

     Meg fain wad to the barn gaen,
     To winn three wechts o' naething;^12
     But for to meet the deil her lane,
     She pat but little faith in:

     [Footnote 12: This charm must likewise be performed
     unperceived and alone. You go to the barn, and open both
     doors, taking them off the hinges, if possible; for there is
     danger that the being about to appear may shut the doors,
     and do you some mischief. Then take that instrument used in
     winnowing the corn, which in our country dialect we call a
     “wecht,” and go through all the attitudes of letting down
     corn against the wind. Repeat it three times, and the third
     time an apparition will pass through the barn, in at the
     windy door and out at the other, having both the figure in
     question, and the appearance or retinue, marking the
     employment or station in life.—R.B.]

     She gies the herd a pickle nits,
     An' twa red cheekit apples,
     To watch, while for the barn she sets,
     In hopes to see Tam Kipples
     That vera night.

     She turns the key wi' cannie thraw,
     An'owre the threshold ventures;
     But first on Sawnie gies a ca',
     Syne baudly in she enters:
     A ratton rattl'd up the wa',
     An' she cry'd Lord preserve her!
     An' ran thro' midden-hole an' a',
     An' pray'd wi' zeal and fervour,
     Fu' fast that night.

     They hoy't out Will, wi' sair advice;
     They hecht him some fine braw ane;
     It chanc'd the stack he faddom't thrice^13
     Was timmer-propt for thrawin:
     He taks a swirlie auld moss-oak
     For some black, grousome carlin;
     An' loot a winze, an' drew a stroke,
     Till skin in blypes cam haurlin
     Aff's nieves that night.

     [Footnote 13: Take an opportunity of going unnoticed to a
     “bear-stack,” and fathom it three times round. The last
     fathom of the last time you will catch in your arms the
     appearance of your future conjugal yoke-fellow.—R.B.]

     A wanton widow Leezie was,
     As cantie as a kittlen;
     But och! that night, amang the shaws,
     She gat a fearfu' settlin!
     She thro' the whins, an' by the cairn,
     An' owre the hill gaed scrievin;
     Whare three lairds' lan's met at a burn,^14
     To dip her left sark-sleeve in,
     Was bent that night.

     [Footnote 14: You go out, one or more (for this is a social
     spell), to a south running spring, or rivulet, where “three
     lairds' lands meet,” and dip your left shirt sleeve. Go to
     bed in sight of a fire, and hang your wet sleeve before it
     to dry. Lie awake, and, some time near midnight, an
     apparition, having the exact figure of the grand object in
     question, will come and turn the sleeve, as if to dry the
     other side of it.—R.B.]

     Whiles owre a linn the burnie plays,
     As thro' the glen it wimpl't;
     Whiles round a rocky scar it strays,
     Whiles in a wiel it dimpl't;
     Whiles glitter'd to the nightly rays,
     Wi' bickerin', dancin' dazzle;
     Whiles cookit undeneath the braes,
     Below the spreading hazel
     Unseen that night.

     Amang the brachens, on the brae,
     Between her an' the moon,
     The deil, or else an outler quey,
     Gat up an' ga'e a croon:
     Poor Leezie's heart maist lap the hool;
     Near lav'rock-height she jumpit,
     But mist a fit, an' in the pool
     Out-owre the lugs she plumpit,
     Wi' a plunge that night.

     In order, on the clean hearth-stane,
     The luggies^15 three are ranged;
     An' ev'ry time great care is ta'en
     To see them duly changed:
     Auld uncle John, wha wedlock's joys
     Sin' Mar's-year did desire,
     Because he gat the toom dish thrice,
     He heav'd them on the fire
     In wrath that night.

     [Footnote 15: Take three dishes, put clean water in one,
     foul water in another, and leave the third empty; blindfold
     a person and lead him to the hearth where the dishes are
     ranged; he (or she) dips the left hand; if by chance in the
     clean water, the future (husband or) wife will come to the
     bar of matrimony a maid; if in the foul, a widow; if in the
     empty dish, it foretells, with equal certainty, no marriage
     at all. It is repeated three times, and every time the
     arrangement of the dishes is altered.—R.B.]

     Wi' merry sangs, an' friendly cracks,
     I wat they did na weary;
     And unco tales, an' funnie jokes—
     Their sports were cheap an' cheery:
     Till butter'd sowens,^16 wi' fragrant lunt,

     [Footnote 16: Sowens, with butter instead of milk to them,
     is always the Halloween Supper.—R.B.]

     Set a' their gabs a-steerin;
     Syne, wi' a social glass o' strunt,
     They parted aff careerin
     Fu' blythe that night.

      To A Mouse, On Turning Her Up In Her Nest With The Plough, November, 1785
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Wee, sleekit, cow'rin, tim'rous beastie,
     O, what a panic's in thy breastie!
     Thou need na start awa sae hasty,
     Wi' bickering brattle!
     I wad be laith to rin an' chase thee,
     Wi' murd'ring pattle!

     I'm truly sorry man's dominion,
     Has broken nature's social union,
     An' justifies that ill opinion,
     Which makes thee startle
     At me, thy poor, earth-born companion,
     An' fellow-mortal!

     I doubt na, whiles, but thou may thieve;
     What then? poor beastie, thou maun live!
     A daimen icker in a thrave
     'S a sma' request;
     I'll get a blessin wi' the lave,
     An' never miss't!

     Thy wee bit housie, too, in ruin!
     It's silly wa's the win's are strewin!
     An' naething, now, to big a new ane,
     O' foggage green!
     An' bleak December's winds ensuin,
     Baith snell an' keen!

     Thou saw the fields laid bare an' waste,
     An' weary winter comin fast,
     An' cozie here, beneath the blast,
     Thou thought to dwell—
     Till crash! the cruel coulter past
     Out thro' thy cell.

     That wee bit heap o' leaves an' stibble,
     Has cost thee mony a weary nibble!
     Now thou's turn'd out, for a' thy trouble,
     But house or hald,
     To thole the winter's sleety dribble,
     An' cranreuch cauld!

     But, Mousie, thou art no thy lane,
     In proving foresight may be vain;
     The best-laid schemes o' mice an 'men
     Gang aft agley,
     An'lea'e us nought but grief an' pain,
     For promis'd joy!

     Still thou art blest, compar'd wi' me
     The present only toucheth thee:
     But, Och! I backward cast my e'e.
     On prospects drear!
     An' forward, tho' I canna see,
     I guess an' fear!

     My 'prenticeship I past where my leader breath'd his last,
     When the bloody die was cast on the heights of Abram:
     and I served out my trade when the gallant game was play'd,
     And the Morro low was laid at the sound of the drum.

     I lastly was with Curtis among the floating batt'ries,
     And there I left for witness an arm and a limb;
     Yet let my country need me, with Elliot to head me,
     I'd clatter on my stumps at the sound of a drum.

     And now tho' I must beg, with a wooden arm and leg,
     And many a tatter'd rag hanging over my bum,
     I'm as happy with my wallet, my bottle, and my callet,
     As when I used in scarlet to follow a drum.

     The first of my loves was a swaggering blade,
     To rattle the thundering drum was his trade;
     His leg was so tight, and his cheek was so ruddy,
     Transported I was with my sodger laddie.

     But the godly old chaplain left him in the lurch;
     The sword I forsook for the sake of the church:
     He ventur'd the soul, and I risked the body,
     'Twas then I proved false to my sodger laddie.

     Full soon I grew sick of my sanctified sot,
     The regiment at large for a husband I got;
     From the gilded spontoon to the fife I was ready,
     I asked no more but a sodger laddie.

     But the peace it reduc'd me to beg in despair,
     Till I met old boy in a Cunningham fair,

     He's there but a 'prentice I trow,
     But I am a fool by profession.

     My grannie she bought me a beuk,
     An' I held awa to the school;
     I fear I my talent misteuk,
     But what will ye hae of a fool?

     For drink I would venture my neck;
     A hizzie's the half of my craft;
     But what could ye other expect
     Of ane that's avowedly daft?

     I ance was tied up like a stirk,
     For civilly swearing and quaffin;
     I ance was abus'd i' the kirk,
     For towsing a lass i' my daffin.

     Poor Andrew that tumbles for sport,
     Let naebody name wi' a jeer;
     There's even, I'm tauld, i' the Court
     A tumbler ca'd the Premier.

     Observ'd ye yon reverend lad
     Mak faces to tickle the mob;
     He rails at our mountebank squad,—
     It's rivalship just i' the job.

     And now my conclusion I'll tell,
     For faith I'm confoundedly dry;
     The chiel that's a fool for himsel',
     Guid Lord! he's far dafter than I.

      The Cotter's Saturday Night
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Inscribed to R. Aiken, Esq., of Ayr.

     Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,
     Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;
     Nor Grandeur hear, with a disdainful smile,
     The short and simple annals of the Poor.
     Gray.

     My lov'd, my honour'd, much respected friend!
     No mercenary bard his homage pays;
     With honest pride, I scorn each selfish end,
     My dearest meed, a friend's esteem and praise:
     To you I sing, in simple Scottish lays,
     The lowly train in life's sequester'd scene,
     The native feelings strong, the guileless ways,
     What Aiken in a cottage would have been;
     Ah! tho' his worth unknown, far happier there I ween!

     November chill blaws loud wi' angry sugh;
     The short'ning winter-day is near a close;
     The miry beasts retreating frae the pleugh;
     The black'ning trains o' craws to their repose:
     The toil-worn Cotter frae his labour goes,—
     This night his weekly moil is at an end,
     Collects his spades, his mattocks, and his hoes,
     Hoping the morn in ease and rest to spend,
     And weary, o'er the moor, his course does hameward bend.

     At length his lonely cot appears in view,
     Beneath the shelter of an aged tree;
     Th' expectant wee-things, toddlin, stacher through
     To meet their dead, wi' flichterin noise and glee.
     His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,
     His clean hearth-stane, his thrifty wifie's smile,
     The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,
     Does a' his weary kiaugh and care beguile,
     And makes him quite forget his labour and his toil.

     Belyve, the elder bairns come drapping in,
     At service out, amang the farmers roun';
     Some ca' the pleugh, some herd, some tentie rin
     A cannie errand to a neibor town:
     Their eldest hope, their Jenny, woman-grown,
     In youthfu' bloom-love sparkling in her e'e—
     Comes hame, perhaps to shew a braw new gown,
     Or deposite her sair-won penny-fee,
     To help her parents dear, if they in hardship be.

     With joy unfeign'd, brothers and sisters meet,
     And each for other's weelfare kindly speirs:
     The social hours, swift-wing'd, unnotic'd fleet:
     Each tells the uncos that he sees or hears.
     The parents, partial, eye their hopeful years;
     Anticipation forward points the view;
     The mother, wi' her needle and her shears,
     Gars auld claes look amaist as weel's the new;
     The father mixes a' wi' admonition due.

     Their master's and their mistress' command,
     The younkers a' are warned to obey;
     And mind their labours wi' an eydent hand,
     And ne'er, tho' out o' sight, to jauk or play;
     “And O! be sure to fear the Lord alway,
     And mind your duty, duly, morn and night;
     Lest in temptation's path ye gang astray,
     Implore His counsel and assisting might:
     They never sought in vain that sought the Lord aright.”

     But hark! a rap comes gently to the door;
     Jenny, wha kens the meaning o' the same,
     Tells how a neibor lad came o'er the moor,
     To do some errands, and convoy her hame.
     The wily mother sees the conscious flame
     Sparkle in Jenny's e'e, and flush her cheek;
     With heart-struck anxious care, enquires his name,
     While Jenny hafflins is afraid to speak;
     Weel-pleased the mother hears, it's nae wild, worthless rake.

     Wi' kindly welcome, Jenny brings him ben;
     A strappin youth, he takes the mother's eye;
     Blythe Jenny sees the visit's no ill ta'en;
     The father cracks of horses, pleughs, and kye.
     The youngster's artless heart o'erflows wi' joy,
     But blate an' laithfu', scarce can weel behave;
     The mother, wi' a woman's wiles, can spy
     What makes the youth sae bashfu' and sae grave,
     Weel-pleas'd to think her bairn's respected like the lave.

     O happy love! where love like this is found:
     O heart-felt raptures! bliss beyond compare!
     I've paced much this weary, mortal round,
     And sage experience bids me this declare,—
     “If Heaven a draught of heavenly pleasure spare—
     One cordial in this melancholy vale,
     'Tis when a youthful, loving, modest pair
     In other'sarms, breathe out the tender tale,
     Beneath the milk-white thorn that scents the evening gale.”

     Is there, in human form, that bears a heart,
     A wretch! a villain! lost to love and truth!
     That can, with studied, sly, ensnaring art,
     Betray sweet Jenny's unsuspecting youth?
     Curse on his perjur'd arts! dissembling smooth!
     Are honour, virtue, conscience, all exil'd?
     Is there no pity, no relenting ruth,
     Points to the parents fondling o'er their child?
     Then paints the ruin'd maid, and their distraction wild?

     But now the supper crowns their simple board,
     The halesome parritch, chief of Scotia's food;
     The sowp their only hawkie does afford,
     That, 'yont the hallan snugly chows her cood:
     The dame brings forth, in complimental mood,
     To grace the lad, her weel-hain'd kebbuck, fell;
     And aft he's prest, and aft he ca's it guid:
     The frugal wifie, garrulous, will tell
     How t'was a towmond auld, sin' lint was i' the bell.

     The cheerfu' supper done, wi' serious face,
     They, round the ingle, form a circle wide;
     The sire turns o'er, with patriarchal grace,
     The big ha'bible, ance his father's pride:
     His bonnet rev'rently is laid aside,
     His lyart haffets wearing thin and bare;
     Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide,
     He wales a portion with judicious care;
     And “Let us worship God!” he says with solemn air.

     They chant their artless notes in simple guise,
     They tune their hearts, by far the noblest aim;
     Perhaps Dundee's wild-warbling measures rise;
     Or plaintive Martyrs, worthy of the name;
     Or noble Elgin beets the heaven-ward flame;
     The sweetest far of Scotia's holy lays:
     Compar'd with these, Italian trills are tame;
     The tickl'd ears no heart-felt raptures raise;
     Nae unison hae they with our Creator's praise.

     The priest-like father reads the sacred page,
     How Abram was the friend of God on high;
     Or Moses bade eternal warfare wage
     With Amalek's ungracious progeny;
     Or how the royal bard did groaning lie
     Beneath the stroke of Heaven's avenging ire;
     Or Job's pathetic plaint, and wailing cry;
     Or rapt Isaiah's wild, seraphic fire;
     Or other holy seers that tune the sacred lyre.

     Perhaps the Christian volume is the theme,
     How guiltless blood for guilty man was shed;
     How He, who bore in Heaven the second name,
     Had not on earth whereon to lay His head:
     How His first followers and servants sped;
     The precepts sage they wrote to many a land:
     How he, who lone in Patmos banished,
     Saw in the sun a mighty angel stand,
     And heard great Bab'lon's doom pronounc'd by Heaven's command.

     Then, kneeling down to Heaven's Eternal King,
     The saint, the father, and the husband prays:
     Hope “springs exulting on triumphant wing,”^1
     That thus they all shall meet in future days,
     There, ever bask in uncreated rays,
     No more to sigh, or shed the bitter tear,
     Together hymning their Creator's praise,
     In such society, yet still more dear;
     While circling Time moves round in an eternal sphere

     Compar'd with this, how poor Religion's pride,
     In all the pomp of method, and of art;
     When men display to congregations wide

     [Footnote 1: Pope's “Windsor Forest.”—R.B.]

     Devotion's ev'ry grace, except the heart!
     The Power, incens'd, the pageant will desert,
     The pompous strain, the sacerdotal stole;
     But haply, in some cottage far apart,
     May hear, well-pleas'd, the language of the soul;
     And in His Book of Life the inmates poor enroll.

     Then homeward all take off their sev'ral way;
     The youngling cottagers retire to rest:
     The parent-pair their secret homage pay,
     And proffer up to Heaven the warm request,
     That he who stills the raven's clam'rous nest,
     And decks the lily fair in flow'ry pride,
     Would, in the way His wisdom sees the best,
     For them and for their little ones provide;
     But chiefly, in their hearts with grace divine preside.

     From scenes like these, old Scotia's grandeur springs,
     That makes her lov'd at home, rever'd abroad:
     Princes and lords are but the breath of kings,
     “An honest man's the noblest work of God;”
      And certes, in fair virtue's heavenly road,
     The cottage leaves the palace far behind;
     What is a lordling's pomp? a cumbrous load,
     Disguising oft the wretch of human kind,
     Studied in arts of hell, in wickedness refin'd!

     O Scotia! my dear, my native soil!
     For whom my warmest wish to Heaven is sent,
     Long may thy hardy sons of rustic toil
     Be blest with health, and peace, and sweet content!
     And O! may Heaven their simple lives prevent
     From luxury's contagion, weak and vile!
     Then howe'er crowns and coronets be rent,
     A virtuous populace may rise the while,
     And stand a wall of fire around their much-lov'd isle.

     O Thou! who pour'd the patriotic tide,
     That stream'd thro' Wallace's undaunted heart,
     Who dar'd to nobly stem tyrannic pride,
     Or nobly die, the second glorious part:
     (The patriot's God peculiarly thou art,
     His friend, inspirer, guardian, and reward!)
     O never, never Scotia's realm desert;
     But still the patriot, and the patriot-bard
     In bright succession raise, her ornament and guard!

      Address To The Deil
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     O Prince! O chief of many throned Pow'rs
     That led th' embattl'd Seraphim to war—
     Milton.

     O Thou! whatever title suit thee—
     Auld Hornie, Satan, Nick, or Clootie,
     Wha in yon cavern grim an' sootie,
     Clos'd under hatches,
     Spairges about the brunstane cootie,
     To scaud poor wretches!

     Hear me, auld Hangie, for a wee,
     An' let poor damned bodies be;
     I'm sure sma' pleasure it can gie,
     Ev'n to a deil,
     To skelp an' scaud poor dogs like me,
     An' hear us squeel!

     Great is thy pow'r an' great thy fame;
     Far ken'd an' noted is thy name;
     An' tho' yon lowin' heuch's thy hame,
     Thou travels far;
     An' faith! thou's neither lag nor lame,
     Nor blate, nor scaur.

     Whiles, ranging like a roarin lion,
     For prey, a' holes and corners tryin;
     Whiles, on the strong-wind'd tempest flyin,
     Tirlin the kirks;
     Whiles, in the human bosom pryin,
     Unseen thou lurks.

     I've heard my rev'rend graunie say,
     In lanely glens ye like to stray;
     Or where auld ruin'd castles grey
     Nod to the moon,
     Ye fright the nightly wand'rer's way,
     Wi' eldritch croon.

     When twilight did my graunie summon,
     To say her pray'rs, douse, honest woman!
     Aft'yont the dyke she's heard you bummin,
     Wi' eerie drone;
     Or, rustlin, thro' the boortrees comin,
     Wi' heavy groan.

     Ae dreary, windy, winter night,
     The stars shot down wi' sklentin light,
     Wi' you, mysel' I gat a fright,
     Ayont the lough;
     Ye, like a rash-buss, stood in sight,
     Wi' wavin' sough.

     The cudgel in my nieve did shake,
     Each brist'ld hair stood like a stake,
     When wi' an eldritch, stoor “quaick, quaick,”
      Amang the springs,
     Awa ye squatter'd like a drake,
     On whistlin' wings.

     Let warlocks grim, an' wither'd hags,
     Tell how wi' you, on ragweed nags,
     They skim the muirs an' dizzy crags,
     Wi' wicked speed;
     And in kirk-yards renew their leagues,
     Owre howkit dead.

     Thence countra wives, wi' toil and pain,
     May plunge an' plunge the kirn in vain;
     For oh! the yellow treasure's ta'en
     By witchin' skill;
     An' dawtit, twal-pint hawkie's gane
     As yell's the bill.

     Thence mystic knots mak great abuse
     On young guidmen, fond, keen an' crouse,
     When the best wark-lume i' the house,
     By cantrip wit,
     Is instant made no worth a louse,
     Just at the bit.

     When thowes dissolve the snawy hoord,
     An' float the jinglin' icy boord,
     Then water-kelpies haunt the foord,
     By your direction,
     And 'nighted trav'llers are allur'd
     To their destruction.

     And aft your moss-traversin Spunkies
     Decoy the wight that late an' drunk is:
     The bleezin, curst, mischievous monkies
     Delude his eyes,
     Till in some miry slough he sunk is,
     Ne'er mair to rise.

     When masons' mystic word an' grip
     In storms an' tempests raise you up,
     Some cock or cat your rage maun stop,
     Or, strange to tell!
     The youngest brither ye wad whip
     Aff straught to hell.

     Lang syne in Eden's bonie yard,
     When youthfu' lovers first were pair'd,
     An' all the soul of love they shar'd,
     The raptur'd hour,
     Sweet on the fragrant flow'ry swaird,
     In shady bower;^1

     Then you, ye auld, snick-drawing dog!
     Ye cam to Paradise incog,

     [Footnote 1: The verse originally ran: “Lang syne, in Eden's
     happy scene When strappin Adam's days were green, And Eve
     was like my bonie Jean, My dearest part, A dancin, sweet,
     young handsome quean, O' guileless heart.”]

     An' play'd on man a cursed brogue,
     (Black be your fa'!)
     An' gied the infant warld a shog,
     'Maist rui'd a'.

     D'ye mind that day when in a bizz
     Wi' reekit duds, an' reestit gizz,
     Ye did present your smoutie phiz
     'Mang better folk,
     An' sklented on the man of Uzz
     Your spitefu' joke?

     An' how ye gat him i' your thrall,
     An' brak him out o' house an hal',
     While scabs and botches did him gall,
     Wi' bitter claw;
     An' lows'd his ill-tongu'd wicked scaul',
     Was warst ava?

     But a' your doings to rehearse,
     Your wily snares an' fechtin fierce,
     Sin' that day Michael^2 did you pierce,
     Down to this time,
     Wad ding a Lallan tounge, or Erse,
     In prose or rhyme.

     An' now, auld Cloots, I ken ye're thinkin,
     A certain bardie's rantin, drinkin,
     Some luckless hour will send him linkin
     To your black pit;
     But faith! he'll turn a corner jinkin,
     An' cheat you yet.

     But fare-you-weel, auld Nickie-ben!
     O wad ye tak a thought an' men'!
     Ye aiblins might—I dinna ken—
     Stil hae a stake:
     I'm wae to think up' yon den,
     Ev'n for your sake!

      Scotch Drink
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Gie him strong drink until he wink,
     That's sinking in despair;
     An' liquor guid to fire his bluid,
     That's prest wi' grief and care:
     There let him bouse, an' deep carouse,
     Wi' bumpers flowing o'er,
     Till he forgets his loves or debts,
     An' minds his griefs no more.

     (Solomon's Proverbs, xxxi. 6, 7.)

     Let other poets raise a fracas
     'Bout vines, an' wines, an' drucken Bacchus,
     An' crabbit names an'stories wrack us,
     An' grate our lug:
     I sing the juice Scotch bear can mak us,
     In glass or jug.

     O thou, my muse! guid auld Scotch drink!
     Whether thro' wimplin worms thou jink,
     Or, richly brown, ream owre the brink,
     In glorious faem,
     Inspire me, till I lisp an' wink,
     To sing thy name!

     Let husky wheat the haughs adorn,
     An' aits set up their awnie horn,
     An' pease and beans, at e'en or morn,
     Perfume the plain:
     Leeze me on thee, John Barleycorn,
     Thou king o' grain!

     On thee aft Scotland chows her cood,
     In souple scones, the wale o'food!
     Or tumblin in the boiling flood
     Wi' kail an' beef;
     But when thou pours thy strong heart's blood,
     There thou shines chief.

     Food fills the wame, an' keeps us leevin;
     Tho' life's a gift no worth receivin,
     When heavy-dragg'd wi' pine an' grievin;
     But, oil'd by thee,
     The wheels o' life gae down-hill, scrievin,
     Wi' rattlin glee.

     Thou clears the head o'doited Lear;
     Thou cheers ahe heart o' drooping Care;
     Thou strings the nerves o' Labour sair,
     At's weary toil;
     Though even brightens dark Despair
     Wi' gloomy smile.

     Aft, clad in massy siller weed,
     Wi' gentles thou erects thy head;
     Yet, humbly kind in time o' need,
     The poor man's wine;
     His weep drap parritch, or his bread,
     Thou kitchens fine.

     Thou art the life o' public haunts;
     But thee, what were our fairs and rants?
     Ev'n godly meetings o' the saunts,
     By thee inspired,
     When gaping they besiege the tents,
     Are doubly fir'd.

     That merry night we get the corn in,
     O sweetly, then, thou reams the horn in!
     Or reekin on a New-year mornin
     In cog or bicker,
     An' just a wee drap sp'ritual burn in,
     An' gusty sucker!

     When Vulcan gies his bellows breath,
     An' ploughmen gather wi' their graith,
     O rare! to see thee fizz an freath
     I' th' luggit caup!
     Then Burnewin comes on like death
     At every chap.

     Nae mercy then, for airn or steel;
     The brawnie, banie, ploughman chiel,
     Brings hard owrehip, wi' sturdy wheel,
     The strong forehammer,
     Till block an' studdie ring an reel,
     Wi' dinsome clamour.

     When skirling weanies see the light,
     Though maks the gossips clatter bright,
     How fumblin' cuiffs their dearies slight;
     Wae worth the name!
     Nae howdie gets a social night,
     Or plack frae them.

     When neibors anger at a plea,
     An' just as wud as wud can be,
     How easy can the barley brie
     Cement the quarrel!
     It's aye the cheapest lawyer's fee,
     To taste the barrel.

     Alake! that e'er my muse has reason,
     To wyte her countrymen wi' treason!
     But mony daily weet their weason
     Wi' liquors nice,
     An' hardly, in a winter season,
     E'er Spier her price.

     Wae worth that brandy, burnin trash!
     Fell source o' mony a pain an' brash!
     Twins mony a poor, doylt, drucken hash,
     O' half his days;
     An' sends, beside, auld Scotland's cash
     To her warst faes.

     Ye Scots, wha wish auld Scotland well!
     Ye chief, to you my tale I tell,
     Poor, plackless devils like mysel'!
     It sets you ill,
     Wi' bitter, dearthfu' wines to mell,
     Or foreign gill.

     May gravels round his blather wrench,
     An' gouts torment him, inch by inch,
     What twists his gruntle wi' a glunch
     O' sour disdain,
     Out owre a glass o' whisky-punch
     Wi' honest men!

     O Whisky! soul o' plays and pranks!
     Accept a bardie's gratfu' thanks!
     When wanting thee, what tuneless cranks
     Are my poor verses!
     Thou comes—they rattle in their ranks,
     At ither's a-s!

     Thee, Ferintosh! O sadly lost!
     Scotland lament frae coast to coast!
     Now colic grips, an' barkin hoast
     May kill us a';
     For loyal Forbes' charter'd boast
     Is ta'en awa?

     Thae curst horse-leeches o' the' Excise,
     Wha mak the whisky stells their prize!
     Haud up thy han', Deil! ance, twice, thrice!
     There, seize the blinkers!
     An' bake them up in brunstane pies
     For poor damn'd drinkers.

     Fortune! if thou'll but gie me still
     Hale breeks, a scone, an' whisky gill,
     An' rowth o' rhyme to rave at will,
     Tak a' the rest,
     An' deal't about as thy blind skill
     Directs thee best.

      The Auld Farmer's New-Year-Morning Salutation To His Auld Mare, Maggie
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     On giving her the accustomed ripp of corn to hansel in the New Year.

     A Guid New-year I wish thee, Maggie!
     Hae, there's a ripp to thy auld baggie:
     Tho' thou's howe-backit now, an' knaggie,
     I've seen the day
     Thou could hae gaen like ony staggie,
     Out-owre the lay.

     Tho' now thou's dowie, stiff, an' crazy,
     An' thy auld hide as white's a daisie,
     I've seen thee dappl't, sleek an' glaizie,
     A bonie gray:
     He should been tight that daur't to raize thee,
     Ance in a day.

     Thou ance was i' the foremost rank,
     A filly buirdly, steeve, an' swank;
     An' set weel down a shapely shank,
     As e'er tread yird;
     An' could hae flown out-owre a stank,
     Like ony bird.

     It's now some nine-an'-twenty year,
     Sin' thou was my guid-father's mear;
     He gied me thee, o' tocher clear,
     An' fifty mark;
     Tho' it was sma', 'twas weel-won gear,
     An' thou was stark.

     When first I gaed to woo my Jenny,
     Ye then was trotting wi' your minnie:
     Tho' ye was trickie, slee, an' funnie,
     Ye ne'er was donsie;
     But hamely, tawie, quiet, an' cannie,
     An' unco sonsie.

     That day, ye pranc'd wi' muckle pride,
     When ye bure hame my bonie bride:
     An' sweet an' gracefu' she did ride,
     Wi' maiden air!
     Kyle-Stewart I could bragged wide
     For sic a pair.

     Tho' now ye dow but hoyte and hobble,
     An' wintle like a saumont coble,
     That day, ye was a jinker noble,
     For heels an' win'!
     An' ran them till they a' did wauble,
     Far, far, behin'!

     When thou an' I were young an' skeigh,
     An' stable-meals at fairs were dreigh,
     How thou wad prance, and snore, an' skreigh
     An' tak the road!
     Town's-bodies ran, an' stood abeigh,
     An' ca't thee mad.

     When thou was corn't, an' I was mellow,
     We took the road aye like a swallow:
     At brooses thou had ne'er a fellow,
     For pith an' speed;
     But ev'ry tail thou pay't them hollowm
     Whare'er thou gaed.

     The sma', droop-rumpl't, hunter cattle
     Might aiblins waur't thee for a brattle;
     But sax Scotch mile, thou try't their mettle,
     An' gar't them whaizle:
     Nae whip nor spur, but just a wattle
     O' saugh or hazel.

     Thou was a noble fittie-lan',
     As e'er in tug or tow was drawn!
     Aft thee an' I, in aught hours' gaun,
     In guid March-weather,
     Hae turn'd sax rood beside our han',
     For days thegither.

     Thou never braing't, an' fetch't, an' fliskit;
     But thy auld tail thou wad hae whiskit,
     An' spread abreed thy weel-fill'd brisket,
     Wi' pith an' power;
     Till sprittie knowes wad rair't an' riskit
     An' slypet owre.

     When frosts lay lang, an' snaws were deep,
     An' threaten'd labour back to keep,
     I gied thy cog a wee bit heap
     Aboon the timmer:
     I ken'd my Maggie wad na sleep,
     For that, or simmer.

     In cart or car thou never reestit;
     The steyest brae thou wad hae fac't it;
     Thou never lap, an' sten't, and breastit,
     Then stood to blaw;
     But just thy step a wee thing hastit,
     Thou snoov't awa.

     My pleugh is now thy bairn-time a',
     Four gallant brutes as e'er did draw;
     Forbye sax mae I've sell't awa,
     That thou hast nurst:
     They drew me thretteen pund an' twa,
     The vera warst.

     Mony a sair daurk we twa hae wrought,
     An' wi' the weary warl' fought!
     An' mony an anxious day, I thought
     We wad be beat!
     Yet here to crazy age we're brought,
     Wi' something yet.

     An' think na', my auld trusty servan',
     That now perhaps thou's less deservin,
     An' thy auld days may end in starvin;
     For my last fow,
     A heapit stimpart, I'll reserve ane
     Laid by for you.

     We've worn to crazy years thegither;
     We'll toyte about wi' ane anither;
     Wi' tentie care I'll flit thy tether
     To some hain'd rig,
     Whare ye may nobly rax your leather,
     Wi' sma' fatigue.

    <h2>
      The Twa Dogs^1
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     A Tale

     'Twas in that place o' Scotland's isle,
     That bears the name o' auld King Coil,
     Upon a bonie day in June,
     When wearin' thro' the afternoon,
     Twa dogs, that were na thrang at hame,
     Forgather'd ance upon a time.

     The first I'll name, they ca'd him Caesar,
     Was keepit for His Honor's pleasure:
     His hair, his size, his mouth, his lugs,
     Shew'd he was nane o' Scotland's dogs;
     But whalpit some place far abroad,
     Whare sailors gang to fish for cod.

     His locked, letter'd, braw brass collar
     Shew'd him the gentleman an' scholar;
     But though he was o' high degree,
     The fient a pride, nae pride had he;
     But wad hae spent an hour caressin,
     Ev'n wi' al tinkler-gipsy's messin:
     At kirk or market, mill or smiddie,
     Nae tawted tyke, tho' e'er sae duddie,
     But he wad stan't, as glad to see him,
     An' stroan't on stanes an' hillocks wi' him.

     The tither was a ploughman's collie—
     A rhyming, ranting, raving billie,
     Wha for his friend an' comrade had him,
     And in freak had Luath ca'd him,
     After some dog in Highland Sang,^2
     Was made lang syne,—Lord knows how lang.

     He was a gash an' faithfu' tyke,
     As ever lap a sheugh or dyke.
     His honest, sonsie, baws'nt face
     Aye gat him friends in ilka place;
     His breast was white, his touzie back
     Weel clad wi' coat o' glossy black;
     His gawsie tail, wi' upward curl,
     Hung owre his hurdie's wi' a swirl.

     [Footnote 1: Luath was Burns' own dog.]

     Nae doubt but they were fain o' ither,
     And unco pack an' thick thegither;
     Wi' social nose whiles snuff'd an' snowkit;
     Whiles mice an' moudieworts they howkit;
     Whiles scour'd awa' in lang excursion,
     An' worry'd ither in diversion;
     Until wi' daffin' weary grown
     Upon a knowe they set them down.
     An' there began a lang digression.
     About the “lords o' the creation.”

     I've aften wonder'd, honest Luath,
     What sort o' life poor dogs like you have;
     An' when the gentry's life I saw,
     What way poor bodies liv'd ava.

     Our laird gets in his racked rents,
     His coals, his kane, an' a' his stents:
     He rises when he likes himsel';
     His flunkies answer at the bell;
     He ca's his coach; he ca's his horse;
     He draws a bonie silken purse,
     As lang's my tail, where, thro' the steeks,
     The yellow letter'd Geordie keeks.

     Frae morn to e'en, it's nought but toiling
     At baking, roasting, frying, boiling;
     An' tho' the gentry first are stechin,
     Yet ev'n the ha' folk fill their pechan
     Wi' sauce, ragouts, an' sic like trashtrie,
     That's little short o' downright wastrie.
     Our whipper-in, wee, blasted wonner,
     Poor, worthless elf, it eats a dinner,
     Better than ony tenant-man
     His Honour has in a' the lan':
     An' what poor cot-folk pit their painch in,
     I own it's past my comprehension.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Luath

     Trowth, Caesar, whiles they're fash't eneugh:
     A cottar howkin in a sheugh,
     Wi' dirty stanes biggin a dyke,
     Baring a quarry, an' sic like;
     Himsel', a wife, he thus sustains,
     A smytrie o' wee duddie weans,
     An' nought but his han'-daurk, to keep
     Them right an' tight in thack an' rape.

     An' when they meet wi' sair disasters,
     Like loss o' health or want o' masters,
     Ye maist wad think, a wee touch langer,
     An' they maun starve o' cauld an' hunger:
     But how it comes, I never kent yet,
     They're maistly wonderfu' contented;
     An' buirdly chiels, an' clever hizzies,
     Are bred in sic a way as this is.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Caesar

     But then to see how ye're negleckit,
     How huff'd, an' cuff'd, an' disrespeckit!
     Lord man, our gentry care as little
     For delvers, ditchers, an' sic cattle;
     They gang as saucy by poor folk,
     As I wad by a stinkin brock.

     I've notic'd, on our laird's court-day,—
     An' mony a time my heart's been wae,—
     Poor tenant bodies, scant o'cash,
     How they maun thole a factor's snash;
     He'll stamp an' threaten, curse an' swear
     He'll apprehend them, poind their gear;
     While they maun stan', wi' aspect humble,
     An' hear it a', an' fear an' tremble!

     I see how folk live that hae riches;
     But surely poor-folk maun be wretches!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Luath

     They're no sae wretched's ane wad think.
     Tho' constantly on poortith's brink,
     They're sae accustom'd wi' the sight,
     The view o't gives them little fright.

     Then chance and fortune are sae guided,
     They're aye in less or mair provided:
     An' tho' fatigued wi' close employment,
     A blink o' rest's a sweet enjoyment.

     The dearest comfort o' their lives,
     Their grushie weans an' faithfu' wives;
     The prattling things are just their pride,
     That sweetens a' their fire-side.

     An' whiles twalpennie worth o' nappy
     Can mak the bodies unco happy:
     They lay aside their private cares,
     To mind the Kirk and State affairs;
     They'll talk o' patronage an' priests,
     Wi' kindling fury i' their breasts,
     Or tell what new taxation's comin,
     An' ferlie at the folk in Lon'on.

     As bleak-fac'd Hallowmass returns,
     They get the jovial, rantin kirns,
     When rural life, of ev'ry station,
     Unite in common recreation;
     Love blinks, Wit slaps, an' social Mirth
     Forgets there's Care upo' the earth.

     That merry day the year begins,
     They bar the door on frosty win's;
     The nappy reeks wi' mantling ream,
     An' sheds a heart-inspiring steam;
     The luntin pipe, an' sneeshin mill,
     Are handed round wi' right guid will;
     The cantie auld folks crackin crouse,
     The young anes rantin thro' the house—
     My heart has been sae fain to see them,
     That I for joy hae barkit wi' them.

     Still it's owre true that ye hae said,
     Sic game is now owre aften play'd;
     There's mony a creditable stock
     O' decent, honest, fawsont folk,
     Are riven out baith root an' branch,
     Some rascal's pridefu' greed to quench,
     Wha thinks to knit himsel the faster
     In favour wi' some gentle master,
     Wha, aiblins, thrang a parliamentin,
     For Britain's guid his saul indentin—
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Caesar

     Haith, lad, ye little ken about it:
     For Britain's guid! guid faith! I doubt it.
     Say rather, gaun as Premiers lead him:
     An' saying ay or no's they bid him:
     At operas an' plays parading,
     Mortgaging, gambling, masquerading:
     Or maybe, in a frolic daft,
     To Hague or Calais takes a waft,
     To mak a tour an' tak a whirl,
     To learn bon ton, an' see the worl'.

     There, at Vienna, or Versailles,
     He rives his father's auld entails;
     Or by Madrid he takes the rout,
     To thrum guitars an' fecht wi' nowt;
     Or down Italian vista startles,

     Whore-hunting amang groves o' myrtles:
     Then bowses drumlie German-water,
     To mak himsel look fair an' fatter,
     An' clear the consequential sorrows,
     Love-gifts of Carnival signoras.

     For Britain's guid! for her destruction!
     Wi' dissipation, feud, an' faction.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Luath

     Hech, man! dear sirs! is that the gate
     They waste sae mony a braw estate!
     Are we sae foughten an' harass'd
     For gear to gang that gate at last?

     O would they stay aback frae courts,
     An' please themsels wi' country sports,
     It wad for ev'ry ane be better,
     The laird, the tenant, an' the cotter!
     For thae frank, rantin, ramblin billies,
     Feint haet o' them's ill-hearted fellows;
     Except for breakin o' their timmer,
     Or speakin lightly o' their limmer,
     Or shootin of a hare or moor-cock,
     The ne'er-a-bit they're ill to poor folk,

     But will ye tell me, Master Caesar,
     Sure great folk's life's a life o' pleasure?
     Nae cauld nor hunger e'er can steer them,
     The very thought o't need na fear them.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Caesar

     Lord, man, were ye but whiles whare I am,
     The gentles, ye wad ne'er envy them!

     It's true, they need na starve or sweat,
     Thro' winter's cauld, or simmer's heat:
     They've nae sair wark to craze their banes,
     An' fill auld age wi' grips an' granes:
     But human bodies are sic fools,
     For a' their colleges an' schools,
     That when nae real ills perplex them,
     They mak enow themsel's to vex them;
     An' aye the less they hae to sturt them,
     In like proportion, less will hurt them.

     A country fellow at the pleugh,
     His acre's till'd, he's right eneugh;
     A country girl at her wheel,
     Her dizzen's dune, she's unco weel;
     But gentlemen, an' ladies warst,
     Wi' ev'n-down want o' wark are curst.
     They loiter, lounging, lank an' lazy;
     Tho' deil-haet ails them, yet uneasy;
     Their days insipid, dull, an' tasteless;
     Their nights unquiet, lang, an' restless.

     An'ev'n their sports, their balls an' races,
     Their galloping through public places,
     There's sic parade, sic pomp, an' art,
     The joy can scarcely reach the heart.

     The men cast out in party-matches,
     Then sowther a' in deep debauches.
     Ae night they're mad wi' drink an' whoring,
     Niest day their life is past enduring.

     The ladies arm-in-arm in clusters,
     As great an' gracious a' as sisters;
     But hear their absent thoughts o' ither,
     They're a' run-deils an' jads thegither.
     Whiles, owre the wee bit cup an' platie,
     They sip the scandal-potion pretty;
     Or lee-lang nights, wi' crabbit leuks
     Pore owre the devil's pictur'd beuks;
     Stake on a chance a farmer's stackyard,
     An' cheat like ony unhanged blackguard.

     There's some exceptions, man an' woman;
     But this is gentry's life in common.

     By this, the sun was out of sight,
     An' darker gloamin brought the night;
     The bum-clock humm'd wi' lazy drone;
     The kye stood rowtin i' the loan;
     When up they gat an' shook their lugs,
     Rejoic'd they werena men but dogs;
     An' each took aff his several way,
     Resolv'd to meet some ither day.

      The Author's Earnest Cry And Prayer
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     To the Right Honourable and Honourable Scotch
     Representatives in the House of Commons.^1

     Dearest of distillation! last and best—

     —How art thou lost!—
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Parody on Milton.

     Ye Irish lords, ye knights an' squires,
     Wha represent our brughs an' shires,
     An' doucely manage our affairs
     In parliament,
     To you a simple poet's pray'rs
     Are humbly sent.

     Alas! my roupit Muse is hearse!
     Your Honours' hearts wi' grief 'twad pierce,
     To see her sittin on her arse
     Low i' the dust,
     And scriechinhout prosaic verse,
     An like to brust!

     [Footnote 1: This was written before the Act anent the
     Scotch distilleries, of session 1786, for which Scotland and
     the author return their most grateful thanks.—R.B.]

     Tell them wha hae the chief direction,
     Scotland an' me's in great affliction,
     E'er sin' they laid that curst restriction
     On aqua-vitae;
     An' rouse them up to strong conviction,
     An' move their pity.

     Stand forth an' tell yon Premier youth
     The honest, open, naked truth:
     Tell him o' mine an' Scotland's drouth,
     His servants humble:
     The muckle deevil blaw you south
     If ye dissemble!

     Does ony great man glunch an' gloom?
     Speak out, an' never fash your thumb!
     Let posts an' pensions sink or soom
     Wi' them wha grant them;
     If honestly they canna come,
     Far better want them.

     In gath'rin votes you were na slack;
     Now stand as tightly by your tack:
     Ne'er claw your lug, an' fidge your back,
     An' hum an' haw;
     But raise your arm, an' tell your crack
     Before them a'.

     Paint Scotland greetin owre her thrissle;
     Her mutchkin stowp as toom's a whissle;
     An' damn'd excisemen in a bussle,
     Seizin a stell,
     Triumphant crushin't like a mussel,
     Or limpet shell!

     Then, on the tither hand present her—
     A blackguard smuggler right behint her,
     An' cheek-for-chow, a chuffie vintner
     Colleaguing join,
     Picking her pouch as bare as winter
     Of a' kind coin.

     Is there, that bears the name o' Scot,
     But feels his heart's bluid rising hot,
     To see his poor auld mither's pot
     Thus dung in staves,
     An' plunder'd o' her hindmost groat
     By gallows knaves?

     Alas! I'm but a nameless wight,
     Trode i' the mire out o' sight?
     But could I like Montgomeries fight,
     Or gab like Boswell,^2
     There's some sark-necks I wad draw tight,
     An' tie some hose well.

     God bless your Honours! can ye see't—
     The kind, auld cantie carlin greet,
     An' no get warmly to your feet,
     An' gar them hear it,
     An' tell them wi'a patriot-heat
     Ye winna bear it?

     Some o' you nicely ken the laws,
     To round the period an' pause,
     An' with rhetoric clause on clause
     To mak harangues;
     Then echo thro' Saint Stephen's wa's
     Auld Scotland's wrangs.

     Dempster,^3 a true blue Scot I'se warran';
     Thee, aith-detesting, chaste Kilkerran;^4
     An' that glib-gabbit Highland baron,
     The Laird o' Graham;^5
     An' ane, a chap that's damn'd aulfarran',
     Dundas his name:^6

     Erskine, a spunkie Norland billie;^7
     True Campbells, Frederick and Ilay;^8

     [Footnote 8: Lord Frederick Campbell, second brother of the Duke
     of Argyll, and Ilay Campbell, Lord Advocate for Scotland,
     afterward President of the Court of Session.]

     An' Livistone, the bauld Sir Willie;^9
     An' mony ithers,
     Whom auld Demosthenes or Tully
     Might own for brithers.

     See sodger Hugh,^10 my watchman stented,
     If poets e'er are represented;
     I ken if that your sword were wanted,
     Ye'd lend a hand;
     But when there's ought to say anent it,
     Ye're at a stand.

     Arouse, my boys! exert your mettle,
     To get auld Scotland back her kettle;
     Or faith! I'll wad my new pleugh-pettle,
     Ye'll see't or lang,
     She'll teach you, wi' a reekin whittle,
     Anither sang.

     This while she's been in crankous mood,
     Her lost Militia fir'd her bluid;
     (Deil na they never mair do guid,
     Play'd her that pliskie!)
     An' now she's like to rin red-wud
     About her whisky.

     An' Lord! if ance they pit her till't,
     Her tartan petticoat she'll kilt,
     An'durk an' pistol at her belt,
     She'll tak the streets,
     An' rin her whittle to the hilt,
     I' the first she meets!

     For God sake, sirs! then speak her fair,
     An' straik her cannie wi' the hair,
     An' to the muckle house repair,
     Wi' instant speed,
     An' strive, wi' a' your wit an' lear,
     To get remead.

     [Footnote 9: Sir Wm. Augustus Cunningham, Baronet, of Livingstone.]

     [Footnote 10: Col. Hugh Montgomery, afterward Earl of Eglinton.]

     Yon ill-tongu'd tinkler, Charlie Fox,
     May taunt you wi' his jeers and mocks;
     But gie him't het, my hearty cocks!
     E'en cowe the cadie!
     An' send him to his dicing box
     An' sportin' lady.

     Tell you guid bluid o' auld Boconnock's, ^11
     I'll be his debt twa mashlum bonnocks,
     An' drink his health in auld Nance Tinnock's ^12
     Nine times a-week,
     If he some scheme, like tea an' winnocks,
     Was kindly seek.

     Could he some commutation broach,
     I'll pledge my aith in guid braid Scotch,
     He needna fear their foul reproach
     Nor erudition,
     Yon mixtie-maxtie, queer hotch-potch,
     The Coalition.

     Auld Scotland has a raucle tongue;
     She's just a devil wi' a rung;
     An' if she promise auld or young
     To tak their part,
     Tho' by the neck she should be strung,
     She'll no desert.

     And now, ye chosen Five-and-Forty,
     May still you mither's heart support ye;
     Then, tho'a minister grow dorty,
     An' kick your place,
     Ye'll snap your gingers, poor an' hearty,
     Before his face.

     God bless your Honours, a' your days,
     Wi' sowps o' kail and brats o' claise,

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Postscript

     Let half-starv'd slaves in warmer skies
     See future wines, rich-clust'ring, rise;
     Their lot auld Scotland ne're envies,
     But, blythe and frisky,
     She eyes her freeborn, martial boys
     Tak aff their whisky.

     What tho' their Phoebus kinder warms,
     While fragrance blooms and beauty charms,
     When wretches range, in famish'd swarms,
     The scented groves;
     Or, hounded forth, dishonour arms
     In hungry droves!

     Their gun's a burden on their shouther;
     They downa bide the stink o' powther;
     Their bauldest thought's a hank'ring swither
     To stan' or rin,
     Till skelp—a shot—they're aff, a'throw'ther,
     To save their skin.

     But bring a Scotchman frae his hill,
     Clap in his cheek a Highland gill,
     Say, such is royal George's will,
     An' there's the foe!
     He has nae thought but how to kill
     Twa at a blow.

     Nae cauld, faint-hearted doubtings tease him;
     Death comes, wi' fearless eye he sees him;
     Wi'bluidy hand a welcome gies him;
     An' when he fa's,
     His latest draught o' breathin lea'es him
     In faint huzzas.

     Sages their solemn een may steek,
     An' raise a philosophic reek,
     An' physically causes seek,
     In clime an' season;
     But tell me whisky's name in Greek
     I'll tell the reason.

     Scotland, my auld, respected mither!
     Tho' whiles ye moistify your leather,
     Till, whare ye sit on craps o' heather,
     Ye tine your dam;
     Freedom an' whisky gang thegither!
     Take aff your dram!

     Cam in wi' Maggie Lauder;^1

     Mak haste an' turn King David owre,
     And lilt wi' holy clangor;
     O' double verse come gie us four,
     An' skirl up the Bangor:
     This day the kirk kicks up a stoure;
     Nae mair the knaves shall wrang her,
     For Heresy is in her pow'r,
     And gloriously she'll whang her

     Come, let a proper text be read,
     An' touch it aff wi' vigour,
     How graceless Ham^5 leugh at his dad,

     Or Phineas^6 drove the murdering blade,
     Wi' whore-abhorring rigour;
     Or Zipporah,^7 the scauldin jad,
     Was like a bluidy tiger

     There, try his mettle on the creed,
     An' bind him down wi' caution,
     That stipend is a carnal weed
     He taks by for the fashion;
     And gie him o'er the flock, to feed,
     And punish each transgression;
     Especial, rams that cross the breed,
     Gie them sufficient threshin;
     Spare them nae day.

     Shall fill thy crib in plenty,
     An' runts o' grace the pick an' wale,
     No gi'en by way o' dainty,
     But ilka day.

     Nae mair by Babel's streams we'll weep,
     To think upon our Zion;
     And hing our fiddles up to sleep,
     Like baby-clouts a-dryin!
     Come, screw the pegs wi' tunefu' cheep,
     And o'er the thairms be tryin;
     Oh, rare to see our elbucks wheep,
     And a' like lamb-tails flyin
     Fu' fast this day.

     Lang, Patronage, with rod o' airn,
     Has shor'd the Kirk's undoin;
     As lately Fenwick, sair forfairn,
     Has proven to its ruin:^8
     Our patron, honest man! Glencairn,
     He saw mischief was brewin;
     An' like a godly, elect bairn,
     He's waled us out a true ane,
     And sound, this day.

     Now Robertson^9 harangue nae mair,
     But steek your gab for ever;
     Or try the wicked town of Ayr,
     For there they'll think you clever;
     Or, nae reflection on your lear,
     Ye may commence a shaver;
     Or to the Netherton^10 repair,
     An' turn a carpet weaver
     Aff-hand this day.

     Mu'trie^11 and you were just a match,
     We never had sic twa drones;
     Auld Hornie did the Laigh Kirk watch,
     Just like a winkin baudrons,
     And aye he catch'd the tither wretch,
     To fry them in his caudrons;
     But now his Honour maun detach,
     Wi' a' his brimstone squadrons,
     Fast, fast this day.

     See, see auld Orthodoxy's faes
     She's swingein thro' the city!
     Hark, how the nine-tail'd cat she plays!
     I vow it's unco pretty:
     There, Learning, with his Greekish face,
     Grunts out some Latin ditty;
     And Common-sense is gaun, she says,
     To mak to Jamie Beattie
     Her plaint this day.

     But there's Morality himsel',
     Embracing all opinions;
     Hear, how he gies the tither yell,
     Between his twa companions!
     See, how she peels the skin an' fell,
     As ane were peelin onions!
     Now there, they're packed aff to hell,
     An' banish'd our dominions,
     Henceforth this day.

     O happy day! rejoice, rejoice!
     Come bouse about the porter!
     Morality's demure decoys
     Shall here nae mair find quarter:
     Mackinlay, Russell, are the boys
     That heresy can torture;
     They'll gie her on a rape a hoyse,
     And cowe her measure shorter
     By th' head some day.

     Come, bring the tither mutchkin in,
     And here's—for a conclusion—
     To ev'ry New Light^12 mother's son,
     From this time forth, Confusion!
     If mair they deave us wi' their din,
     Or Patronage intrusion,
     We'll light a spunk, and ev'ry skin,
     We'll rin them aff in fusion
     Like oil, some day.

     [Footnote 12: “New Light” is a cant phrase in the west of
     Scotland for those religious opinions which Dr. Taylor of
     Norwich has so strenuously defended.—R. B.]

      Epistle To James Smith
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Friendship, mysterious cement of the soul!
     Sweet'ner of Life, and solder of Society!
     I owe thee much—Blair.

     Dear Smith, the slee'st, pawkie thief,
     That e'er attempted stealth or rief!
     Ye surely hae some warlock-brief
     Owre human hearts;
     For ne'er a bosom yet was prief
     Against your arts.

     For me, I swear by sun an' moon,
     An' ev'ry star that blinks aboon,
     Ye've cost me twenty pair o' shoon,
     Just gaun to see you;
     An' ev'ry ither pair that's done,
     Mair taen I'm wi' you.

     That auld, capricious carlin, Nature,
     To mak amends for scrimpit stature,
     She's turn'd you off, a human creature
     On her first plan,
     And in her freaks, on ev'ry feature
     She's wrote the Man.

     Just now I've ta'en the fit o' rhyme,
     My barmie noddle's working prime.
     My fancy yerkit up sublime,
     Wi' hasty summon;
     Hae ye a leisure-moment's time
     To hear what's comin?

     Some rhyme a neibor's name to lash;
     Some rhyme (vain thought!) for needfu' cash;
     Some rhyme to court the countra clash,
     An' raise a din;
     For me, an aim I never fash;
     I rhyme for fun.

     The star that rules my luckless lot,
     Has fated me the russet coat,
     An' damn'd my fortune to the groat;
     But, in requit,
     Has blest me with a random-shot
     O'countra wit.

     This while my notion's taen a sklent,
     To try my fate in guid, black prent;
     But still the mair I'm that way bent,
     Something cries “Hooklie!”
      I red you, honest man, tak tent?
     Ye'll shaw your folly;

     “There's ither poets, much your betters,
     Far seen in Greek, deep men o' letters,
     Hae thought they had ensur'd their debtors,
     A' future ages;
     Now moths deform, in shapeless tatters,
     Their unknown pages.”

     Then farewell hopes of laurel-boughs,
     To garland my poetic brows!
     Henceforth I'll rove where busy ploughs
     Are whistlin' thrang,
     An' teach the lanely heights an' howes
     My rustic sang.

     I'll wander on, wi' tentless heed
     How never-halting moments speed,
     Till fate shall snap the brittle thread;
     Then, all unknown,
     I'll lay me with th' inglorious dead
     Forgot and gone!

     But why o' death being a tale?
     Just now we're living sound and hale;
     Then top and maintop crowd the sail,
     Heave Care o'er-side!
     And large, before Enjoyment's gale,
     Let's tak the tide.

     This life, sae far's I understand,
     Is a' enchanted fairy-land,
     Where Pleasure is the magic-wand,
     That, wielded right,
     Maks hours like minutes, hand in hand,
     Dance by fu' light.

     The magic-wand then let us wield;
     For ance that five-an'-forty's speel'd,
     See, crazy, weary, joyless eild,
     Wi' wrinkl'd face,
     Comes hostin, hirplin owre the field,
     We' creepin pace.

     When ance life's day draws near the gloamin,
     Then fareweel vacant, careless roamin;
     An' fareweel cheerfu' tankards foamin,
     An' social noise:
     An' fareweel dear, deluding woman,
     The Joy of joys!

     O Life! how pleasant, in thy morning,
     Young Fancy's rays the hills adorning!
     Cold-pausing Caution's lesson scorning,
     We frisk away,
     Like school-boys, at th' expected warning,
     To joy an' play.

     We wander there, we wander here,
     We eye the rose upon the brier,
     Unmindful that the thorn is near,
     Among the leaves;
     And tho' the puny wound appear,
     Short while it grieves.

     Some, lucky, find a flow'ry spot,
     For which they never toil'd nor swat;
     They drink the sweet and eat the fat,
     But care or pain;
     And haply eye the barren hut
     With high disdain.

     With steady aim, some Fortune chase;
     Keen hope does ev'ry sinew brace;
     Thro' fair, thro' foul, they urge the race,
     An' seize the prey:
     Then cannie, in some cozie place,
     They close the day.

     And others, like your humble servan',
     Poor wights! nae rules nor roads observin,
     To right or left eternal swervin,
     They zig-zag on;
     Till, curst with age, obscure an' starvin,
     They aften groan.

     Alas! what bitter toil an' straining—
     But truce with peevish, poor complaining!
     Is fortune's fickle Luna waning?
     E'n let her gang!
     Beneath what light she has remaining,
     Let's sing our sang.

     My pen I here fling to the door,
     And kneel, ye Pow'rs! and warm implore,
     “Tho' I should wander Terra o'er,
     In all her climes,
     Grant me but this, I ask no more,
     Aye rowth o' rhymes.

     “Gie dreepin roasts to countra lairds,
     Till icicles hing frae their beards;
     Gie fine braw claes to fine life-guards,
     And maids of honour;
     An' yill an' whisky gie to cairds,
     Until they sconner.

     “A title, Dempster^1 merits it;
     A garter gie to Willie Pitt;
     Gie wealth to some be-ledger'd cit,
     In cent. per cent.;
     But give me real, sterling wit,
     And I'm content.

     [Footnote 1: George Dempster of Dunnichen, M.P.]

     “While ye are pleas'd to keep me hale,
     I'll sit down o'er my scanty meal,
     Be't water-brose or muslin-kail,
     Wi' cheerfu' face,
     As lang's the Muses dinna fail
     To say the grace.”

     An anxious e'e I never throws
     Behint my lug, or by my nose;
     I jouk beneath Misfortune's blows
     As weel's I may;
     Sworn foe to sorrow, care, and prose,
     I rhyme away.

     O ye douce folk that live by rule,
     Grave, tideless-blooded, calm an'cool,
     Compar'd wi' you—O fool! fool! fool!
     How much unlike!
     Your hearts are just a standing pool,
     Your lives, a dyke!

     Nae hair-brain'd, sentimental traces
     In your unletter'd, nameless faces!
     In arioso trills and graces
     Ye never stray;
     But gravissimo, solemn basses
     Ye hum away.

     Ye are sae grave, nae doubt ye're wise;
     Nae ferly tho' ye do despise
     The hairum-scairum, ram-stam boys,
     The rattling squad:
     I see ye upward cast your eyes—
     Ye ken the road!

     Whilst I—but I shall haud me there,
     Wi' you I'll scarce gang ony where—
     Then, Jamie, I shall say nae mair,
     But quat my sang,
     Content wi' you to mak a pair.
     Whare'er I gang.

      The Vision
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Duan First^1

     The sun had clos'd the winter day,
     The curless quat their roarin play,
     And hunger'd maukin taen her way,
     To kail-yards green,
     While faithless snaws ilk step betray
     Whare she has been.

     The thresher's weary flingin-tree,
     The lee-lang day had tired me;
     And when the day had clos'd his e'e,
     Far i' the west,
     Ben i' the spence, right pensivelie,
     I gaed to rest.

     There, lanely by the ingle-cheek,
     I sat and ey'd the spewing reek,
     That fill'd, wi' hoast-provoking smeek,
     The auld clay biggin;
     An' heard the restless rattons squeak
     About the riggin.

     All in this mottie, misty clime,
     I backward mus'd on wasted time,
     How I had spent my youthfu' prime,
     An' done nae thing,
     But stringing blethers up in rhyme,
     For fools to sing.

     Had I to guid advice but harkit,
     I might, by this, hae led a market,
     Or strutted in a bank and clarkit
     My cash-account;
     While here, half-mad, half-fed, half-sarkit.
     Is a' th' amount.

     [Footnote 1: Duan, a term of Ossian's for the different
     divisions of a digressive poem. See his Cath-Loda, vol. 2 of
     M'Pherson's translation.—R. B.]

     I started, mutt'ring, “blockhead! coof!”
      And heav'd on high my waukit loof,
     To swear by a' yon starry roof,
     Or some rash aith,
     That I henceforth wad be rhyme-proof
     Till my last breath—

     When click! the string the snick did draw;
     An' jee! the door gaed to the wa';
     An' by my ingle-lowe I saw,
     Now bleezin bright,
     A tight, outlandish hizzie, braw,
     Come full in sight.

     Ye need na doubt, I held my whisht;
     The infant aith, half-form'd, was crusht
     I glowr'd as eerie's I'd been dusht
     In some wild glen;
     When sweet, like honest Worth, she blusht,
     An' stepped ben.

     Green, slender, leaf-clad holly-boughs
     Were twisted, gracefu', round her brows;
     I took her for some Scottish Muse,
     By that same token;
     And come to stop those reckless vows,
     Would soon been broken.

     A “hair-brain'd, sentimental trace”
      Was strongly marked in her face;
     A wildly-witty, rustic grace
     Shone full upon her;
     Her eye, ev'n turn'd on empty space,
     Beam'd keen with honour.

     Down flow'd her robe, a tartan sheen,
     Till half a leg was scrimply seen;
     An' such a leg! my bonie Jean
     Could only peer it;
     Sae straught, sae taper, tight an' clean—
     Nane else came near it.

     Her mantle large, of greenish hue,
     My gazing wonder chiefly drew:
     Deep lights and shades, bold-mingling, threw
     A lustre grand;
     And seem'd, to my astonish'd view,
     A well-known land.

     Here, rivers in the sea were lost;
     There, mountains to the skies were toss't:
     Here, tumbling billows mark'd the coast,
     With surging foam;
     There, distant shone Art's lofty boast,
     The lordly dome.

     Here, Doon pour'd down his far-fetch'd floods;
     There, well-fed Irwine stately thuds:
     Auld hermit Ayr staw thro' his woods,
     On to the shore;
     And many a lesser torrent scuds,
     With seeming roar.

     Low, in a sandy valley spread,
     An ancient borough rear'd her head;
     Still, as in Scottish story read,
     She boasts a race
     To ev'ry nobler virtue bred,
     And polish'd grace.^2

     By stately tow'r, or palace fair,
     Or ruins pendent in the air,
     Bold stems of heroes, here and there,
     I could discern;
     Some seem'd to muse, some seem'd to dare,
     With feature stern.

     My heart did glowing transport feel,
     To see a race heroic^3 wheel,

     [Footnote 2: The seven stanzas following this were first
     printed in the Edinburgh edition, 1787. Other stanzas, never
     published by Burns himself, are given on p. 180.]

     [Footnote 3: The Wallaces.—R. B.]

     And brandish round the deep-dyed steel,
     In sturdy blows;
     While, back-recoiling, seem'd to reel
     Their Suthron foes.

     His Country's Saviour,^4 mark him well!
     Bold Richardton's heroic swell;^5
     The chief, on Sark who glorious fell,^6
     In high command;
     And he whom ruthless fates expel
     His native land.

     There, where a sceptr'd Pictish shade
     Stalk'd round his ashes lowly laid,^7
     I mark'd a martial race, pourtray'd
     In colours strong:
     Bold, soldier-featur'd, undismay'd,
     They strode along.

     Thro' many a wild, romantic grove,^8
     Near many a hermit-fancied cove
     (Fit haunts for friendship or for love,
     In musing mood),
     An aged Judge, I saw him rove,
     Dispensing good.

     With deep-struck, reverential awe,
     The learned Sire and Son I saw:^9
     To Nature's God, and Nature's law,
     They gave their lore;
     This, all its source and end to draw,
     That, to adore.

     victory was principally owing to the judicious conduct and
     intrepid valour of the gallant laird of Craigie, who died of
     his wounds after the action.—R.B.]

     Brydon's brave ward^10 I well could spy,
     Beneath old Scotia's smiling eye:
     Who call'd on Fame, low standing by,
     To hand him on,
     Where many a patriot-name on high,
     And hero shone.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Duan Second

     With musing-deep, astonish'd stare,
     I view'd the heavenly-seeming Fair;
     A whispering throb did witness bear
     Of kindred sweet,
     When with an elder sister's air
     She did me greet.

     “All hail! my own inspired bard!
     In me thy native Muse regard;
     Nor longer mourn thy fate is hard,
     Thus poorly low;
     I come to give thee such reward,
     As we bestow!

     “Know, the great genius of this land
     Has many a light aerial band,
     Who, all beneath his high command,
     Harmoniously,
     As arts or arms they understand,
     Their labours ply.

     “They Scotia's race among them share:
     Some fire the soldier on to dare;
     Some rouse the patriot up to bare
     Corruption's heart:
     Some teach the bard—a darling care—
     The tuneful art.

     “'Mong swelling floods of reeking gore,
     They, ardent, kindling spirits pour;

     [Footnote 10: Colonel Fullarton.—R.B. This gentleman had
     travelled under the care of Patrick Brydone, author of a
     well-known “Tour Through Sicily and Malta.”]

     Or, 'mid the venal senate's roar,
     They, sightless, stand,
     To mend the honest patriot-lore,
     And grace the hand.

     “And when the bard, or hoary sage,
     Charm or instruct the future age,
     They bind the wild poetric rage
     In energy,
     Or point the inconclusive page
     Full on the eye.

     “Hence, Fullarton, the brave and young;
     Hence, Dempster's zeal-inspired tongue;
     Hence, sweet, harmonious Beattie sung
     His 'Minstrel lays';
     Or tore, with noble ardour stung,
     The sceptic's bays.

     “To lower orders are assign'd
     The humbler ranks of human-kind,
     The rustic bard, the lab'ring hind,
     The artisan;
     All choose, as various they're inclin'd,
     The various man.

     “When yellow waves the heavy grain,
     The threat'ning storm some strongly rein;
     Some teach to meliorate the plain
     With tillage-skill;
     And some instruct the shepherd-train,
     Blythe o'er the hill.

     “Some hint the lover's harmless wile;
     Some grace the maiden's artless smile;
     Some soothe the lab'rer's weary toil
     For humble gains,
     And make his cottage-scenes beguile
     His cares and pains.

     “Some, bounded to a district-space
     Explore at large man's infant race,
     To mark the embryotic trace
     Of rustic bard;
     And careful note each opening grace,
     A guide and guard.

     “Of these am I—Coila my name:
     And this district as mine I claim,
     Where once the Campbells, chiefs of fame,
     Held ruling power:
     I mark'd thy embryo-tuneful flame,
     Thy natal hour.

     “With future hope I oft would gaze
     Fond, on thy little early ways,
     Thy rudely, caroll'd, chiming phrase,
     In uncouth rhymes;
     Fir'd at the simple, artless lays
     Of other times.

     “I saw thee seek the sounding shore,
     Delighted with the dashing roar;
     Or when the North his fleecy store
     Drove thro' the sky,
     I saw grim Nature's visage hoar
     Struck thy young eye.

     “Or when the deep green-mantled earth
     Warm cherish'd ev'ry floweret's birth,
     And joy and music pouring forth
     In ev'ry grove;
     I saw thee eye the general mirth
     With boundless love.

     “When ripen'd fields and azure skies
     Call'd forth the reapers' rustling noise,
     I saw thee leave their ev'ning joys,
     And lonely stalk,
     To vent thy bosom's swelling rise,
     In pensive walk.

     “When youthful love, warm-blushing, strong,
     Keen-shivering, shot thy nerves along,
     Those accents grateful to thy tongue,
     Th' adored Name,
     I taught thee how to pour in song,
     To soothe thy flame.

     “I saw thy pulse's maddening play,
     Wild send thee Pleasure's devious way,
     Misled by Fancy's meteor-ray,
     By passion driven;
     But yet the light that led astray
     Was light from Heaven.

     “I taught thy manners-painting strains,
     The loves, the ways of simple swains,
     Till now, o'er all my wide domains
     Thy fame extends;
     And some, the pride of Coila's plains,
     Become thy friends.

     “Thou canst not learn, nor I can show,
     To paint with Thomson's landscape glow;
     Or wake the bosom-melting throe,
     With Shenstone's art;
     Or pour, with Gray, the moving flow
     Warm on the heart.

     “Yet, all beneath th' unrivall'd rose,
     T e lowly daisy sweetly blows;
     Tho' large the forest's monarch throws
     His army shade,
     Yet green the juicy hawthorn grows,
     Adown the glade.

     “Then never murmur nor repine;
     Strive in thy humble sphere to shine;
     And trust me, not Potosi's mine,
     Nor king's regard,
     Can give a bliss o'ermatching thine,
     A rustic bard.

     “To give my counsels all in one,
     Thy tuneful flame still careful fan:
     Preserve the dignity of Man,
     With soul erect;
     And trust the Universal Plan
     Will all protect.

     “And wear thou this”—she solemn said,
     And bound the holly round my head:
     The polish'd leaves and berries red
     Did rustling play;
     And, like a passing thought, she fled
     In light away.

     [To Mrs. Stewart of Stair, Burns presented a manuscript copy of
     the Vision. That copy embraces about twenty stanzas at the end of
     Duan First, which he cancelled when he came to print the price in
     his Kilmarnock volume. Seven of these he restored in printing his
     second edition, as noted on p. 174. The following are the verses
     which he left unpublished.]

    <h2>
      Suppressed Stanza's Of “The Vision”
     </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     After 18th stanza of the text (at “His native land”):—

     With secret throes I marked that earth,
     That cottage, witness of my birth;
     And near I saw, bold issuing forth
     In youthful pride,
     A Lindsay race of noble worth,
     Famed far and wide.

     Where, hid behind a spreading wood,
     An ancient Pict-built mansion stood,
     I spied, among an angel brood,
     A female pair;
     Sweet shone their high maternal blood,
     And father's air.^1

     An ancient tower^2 to memory brought
     How Dettingen's bold hero fought;
     Still, far from sinking into nought,
     It owns a lord
     Who far in western climates fought,
     With trusty sword.

     [Footnote 1: Sundrum.—R.B.]

     [Footnote 2: Stair.—R.B.]

     Among the rest I well could spy
     One gallant, graceful, martial boy,
     The soldier sparkled in his eye,
     A diamond water.
     I blest that noble badge with joy,
     That owned me frater.^3
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     After 20th stanza of the text (at “Dispensing good”):—

     Near by arose a mansion fine^4
     The seat of many a muse divine;
     Not rustic muses such as mine,
     With holly crown'd,
     But th' ancient, tuneful, laurell'd Nine,
     From classic ground.

     I mourn'd the card that Fortune dealt,
     To see where bonie Whitefoords dwelt;^5
     But other prospects made me melt,
     That village near;^6
     There Nature, Friendship, Love, I felt,
     Fond-mingling, dear!

     Hail! Nature's pang, more strong than death!
     Warm Friendship's glow, like kindling wrath!
     Love, dearer than the parting breath
     Of dying friend!
     Not ev'n with life's wild devious path,
     Your force shall end!

     The Power that gave the soft alarms
     In blooming Whitefoord's rosy charms,
     Still threats the tiny, feather'd arms,
     The barbed dart,
     While lovely Wilhelmina warms
     The coldest heart.^7
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     After 21st stanza of the text (at “That, to adore”):—

     Where Lugar leaves his moorland plaid,^8
     Where lately Want was idly laid,

     [Footnote 3: Captain James Montgomerie, Master of St. James'
     Lodge, Tarbolton, to which the author has the honour to
     belong.—R.B.]

     [Footnote 4: Auchinleck.—R.B.]

     [Footnote 5: Ballochmyle.]

     [Footnote 6: Mauchline.]

     [Footnote 7: Miss Wilhelmina Alexander.]

     [Footnote 8: Cumnock.—R.B.]

     I marked busy, bustling Trade,
     In fervid flame,
     Beneath a Patroness' aid,
     of noble name.

     Wild, countless hills I could survey,
     And countless flocks as wild as they;
     But other scenes did charms display,
     That better please,
     Where polish'd manners dwell with Gray,
     In rural ease.^9

     Where Cessnock pours with gurgling sound;^10
     And Irwine, marking out the bound,
     Enamour'd of the scenes around,
     Slow runs his race,
     A name I doubly honour'd found,^11
     With knightly grace.

     Brydon's brave ward,^12 I saw him stand,
     Fame humbly offering her hand,
     And near, his kinsman's rustic band,^13
     With one accord,
     Lamenting their late blessed land
     Must change its lord.

     The owner of a pleasant spot,
     Near and sandy wilds, I last did note;^14
     A heart too warm, a pulse too hot
     At times, o'erran:
     But large in ev'ry feature wrote,
     Appear'd the Man.

      Address To The Unco Guid, Or The Rigidly Righteous
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     My Son, these maxims make a rule,
     An' lump them aye thegither;
     The Rigid Righteous is a fool,
     The Rigid Wise anither:
     The cleanest corn that ere was dight
     May hae some pyles o' caff in;
     So ne'er a fellow-creature slight
     For random fits o' daffin.

     (Solomon.—Eccles. ch. vii. verse 16.)

     O ye wha are sae guid yoursel',
     Sae pious and sae holy,
     Ye've nought to do but mark and tell
     Your neibours' fauts and folly!
     Whase life is like a weel-gaun mill,
     Supplied wi' store o' water;
     The heaped happer's ebbing still,
     An' still the clap plays clatter.

     Hear me, ye venerable core,
     As counsel for poor mortals
     That frequent pass douce Wisdom's door
     For glaikit Folly's portals:
     I, for their thoughtless, careless sakes,
     Would here propone defences—
     Their donsie tricks, their black mistakes,
     Their failings and mischances.

     Ye see your state wi' theirs compared,
     And shudder at the niffer;
     But cast a moment's fair regard,
     What maks the mighty differ;
     Discount what scant occasion gave,
     That purity ye pride in;
     And (what's aft mair than a' the lave),
     Your better art o' hidin.

     Think, when your castigated pulse
     Gies now and then a wallop!
     What ragings must his veins convulse,
     That still eternal gallop!
     Wi' wind and tide fair i' your tail,
     Right on ye scud your sea-way;
     But in the teeth o' baith to sail,
     It maks a unco lee-way.

     See Social Life and Glee sit down,
     All joyous and unthinking,
     Till, quite transmugrified, they're grown
     Debauchery and Drinking:
     O would they stay to calculate
     Th' eternal consequences;
     Or your more dreaded hell to state,
     Damnation of expenses!

     Ye high, exalted, virtuous dames,
     Tied up in godly laces,
     Before ye gie poor Frailty names,
     Suppose a change o' cases;
     A dear-lov'd lad, convenience snug,
     A treach'rous inclination—
     But let me whisper i' your lug,
     Ye're aiblins nae temptation.

     Then gently scan your brother man,
     Still gentler sister woman;
     Tho' they may gang a kennin wrang,
     To step aside is human:
     One point must still be greatly dark,—
     The moving Why they do it;
     And just as lamely can ye mark,
     How far perhaps they rue it.

     Who made the heart, 'tis He alone
     Decidedly can try us;
     He knows each chord, its various tone,
     Each spring, its various bias:
     Then at the balance let's be mute,
     We never can adjust it;
     What's done we partly may compute,
     But know not what's resisted.

      The Inventory^1
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     In answer to a mandate by the Surveyor of the Taxes

     Sir, as your mandate did request,
     I send you here a faithfu' list,
     O' gudes an' gear, an' a' my graith,
     To which I'm clear to gi'e my aith.

     Imprimis, then, for carriage cattle,
     I hae four brutes o' gallant mettle,
     As ever drew afore a pettle.
     My hand-afore 's a guid auld has-been,
     An' wight an' wilfu' a' his days been:
     My hand-ahin 's a weel gaun fillie,
     That aft has borne me hame frae Killie.^2
     An' your auld borough mony a time
     In days when riding was nae crime.
     But ance, when in my wooing pride
     I, like a blockhead, boost to ride,
     The wilfu' creature sae I pat to,
     (Lord pardon a' my sins, an' that too!)
     I play'd my fillie sic a shavie,
     She's a' bedevil'd wi' the spavie.
     My furr-ahin 's a wordy beast,
     As e'er in tug or tow was traced.
     The fourth's a Highland Donald hastle,
     A damn'd red-wud Kilburnie blastie!
     Foreby a cowt, o' cowts the wale,
     As ever ran afore a tail:
     Gin he be spar'd to be a beast,
     He'll draw me fifteen pund at least.
     Wheel-carriages I ha'e but few,
     Three carts, an' twa are feckly new;
     An auld wheelbarrow, mair for token,
     Ae leg an' baith the trams are broken;
     I made a poker o' the spin'le,
     An' my auld mither brunt the trin'le.

     [Footnote 1: The “Inventory” was addressed to
      Mr. Aitken of Ayr, surveyor of taxes for the district.]

     [Footnote 2: Kilmarnock.—R. B.]

     For men, I've three mischievous boys,
     Run-deils for ranting an' for noise;
     A gaudsman ane, a thrasher t' other:
     Wee Davock hauds the nowt in fother.
     I rule them as I ought, discreetly,
     An' aften labour them completely;
     An' aye on Sundays duly, nightly,
     I on the Questions targe them tightly;
     Till, faith! wee Davock's grown sae gleg,
     Tho' scarcely langer than your leg,
     He'll screed you aff Effectual Calling,
     As fast as ony in the dwalling.

     I've nane in female servant station,
     (Lord keep me aye frae a' temptation!)
     I hae nae wife—and thay my bliss is,
     An' ye have laid nae tax on misses;
     An' then, if kirk folks dinna clutch me,
     I ken the deevils darena touch me.
     Wi' weans I'm mair than weel contented,
     Heav'n sent me ane mae than I wanted!
     My sonsie, smirking, dear-bought Bess,
     She stares the daddy in her face,
     Enough of ought ye like but grace;
     But her, my bonie, sweet wee lady,
     I've paid enough for her already;
     An' gin ye tax her or her mither,
     By the Lord, ye'se get them a' thegither!

     And now, remember, Mr. Aiken,
     Nae kind of licence out I'm takin:
     Frae this time forth, I do declare
     I'se ne'er ride horse nor hizzie mair;
     Thro' dirt and dub for life I'll paidle,
     Ere I sae dear pay for a saddle;
     My travel a' on foot I'll shank it,
     I've sturdy bearers, Gude the thankit!
     The kirk and you may tak you that,
     It puts but little in your pat;
     Sae dinna put me in your beuk,
     Nor for my ten white shillings leuk.

     This list, wi' my ain hand I wrote it,
     The day and date as under noted;
     Then know all ye whom it concerns,
     Subscripsi huic,

      Song, Composed In Spring
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Tune—“Jockey's Grey Breeks.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Again rejoicing Nature sees
     Her robe assume its vernal hues:
     Her leafy locks wave in the breeze,
     All freshly steep'd in morning dews.

     Chorus.—And maun I still on Menie doat,
     And bear the scorn that's in her e'e?
     For it's jet, jet black, an' it's like a hawk,
     An' it winna let a body be.

     In vain to me the cowslips blaw,
     In vain to me the vi'lets spring;
     In vain to me in glen or shaw,
     The mavis and the lintwhite sing.
     And maun I still, &amp;c.

     The merry ploughboy cheers his team,
     Wi' joy the tentie seedsman stalks;
     But life to me's a weary dream,
     A dream of ane that never wauks.
     And maun I still, &amp;c.

     The wanton coot the water skims,
     Amang the reeds the ducklings cry,
     The stately swan majestic swims,
     And ev'ry thing is blest but I.
     And maun I still, &amp;c.

     The sheep-herd steeks his faulding slap,
     And o'er the moorlands whistles shill:
     Wi' wild, unequal, wand'ring step,
     I meet him on the dewy hill.
     And maun I still, &amp;c.

     And when the lark, 'tween light and dark,
     Blythe waukens by the daisy's side,
     And mounts and sings on flittering wings,
     A woe-worn ghaist I hameward glide.
     And maun I still, &amp;c.

     Come winter, with thine angry howl,
     And raging, bend the naked tree;
     Thy gloom will soothe my cheerless soul,
     When nature all is sad like me!
     And maun I still, &amp;c.

    <h2>
      To A Mountain Daisy,
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     On turning down with the Plough, in April, 1786.

     Wee, modest crimson-tipped flow'r,
     Thou's met me in an evil hour;
     For I maun crush amang the stoure
     Thy slender stem:
     To spare thee now is past my pow'r,
     Thou bonie gem.

     Alas! it's no thy neibor sweet,
     The bonie lark, companion meet,
     Bending thee 'mang the dewy weet,
     Wi' spreckl'd breast!
     When upward-springing, blythe, to greet
     The purpling east.

     Cauld blew the bitter-biting north
     Upon thy early, humble birth;
     Yet cheerfully thou glinted forth
     Amid the storm,
     Scarce rear'd above the parent-earth
     Thy tender form.

     The flaunting flow'rs our gardens yield,
     High shelt'ring woods and wa's maun shield;
     But thou, beneath the random bield
     O' clod or stane,
     Adorns the histie stibble field,
     Unseen, alane.

     There, in thy scanty mantle clad,
     Thy snawie bosom sun-ward spread,
     Thou lifts thy unassuming head
     In humble guise;
     But now the share uptears thy bed,
     And low thou lies!

     Such is the fate of artless maid,
     Sweet flow'ret of the rural shade!
     By love's simplicity betray'd,
     And guileless trust;
     Till she, like thee, all soil'd, is laid
     Low i' the dust.

     Such is the fate of simple bard,
     On life's rough ocean luckless starr'd!
     Unskilful he to note the card
     Of prudent lore,
     Till billows rage, and gales blow hard,
     And whelm him o'er!

     Such fate to suffering worth is giv'n,
     Who long with wants and woes has striv'n,
     By human pride or cunning driv'n
     To mis'ry's brink;
     Till wrench'd of ev'ry stay but Heav'n,
     He, ruin'd, sink!

     Ev'n thou who mourn'st the Daisy's fate,
     That fate is thine—no distant date;
     Stern Ruin's plough-share drives elate,
     Full on thy bloom,
     Till crush'd beneath the furrow's weight,
     Shall be thy doom!

      To Ruin
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     All hail! inexorable lord!
     At whose destruction-breathing word,
     The mightiest empires fall!
     Thy cruel, woe-delighted train,
     The ministers of grief and pain,
     A sullen welcome, all!

     With stern-resolv'd, despairing eye,
     I see each aimed dart;
     For one has cut my dearest tie,
     And quivers in my heart.
     Then low'ring, and pouring,
     The storm no more I dread;
     Tho' thick'ning, and black'ning,
     Round my devoted head.

     And thou grim Pow'r by life abhorr'd,
     While life a pleasure can afford,
     Oh! hear a wretch's pray'r!
     Nor more I shrink appall'd, afraid;
     I court, I beg thy friendly aid,
     To close this scene of care!
     When shall my soul, in silent peace,
     Resign life's joyless day—
     My weary heart its throbbing cease,
     Cold mould'ring in the clay?
     No fear more, no tear more,
     To stain my lifeless face,
     Enclasped, and grasped,
     Within thy cold embrace!

    <h2>
      The Lament
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Occasioned by the unfortunate issue of a Friend's Amour.

     Alas! how oft does goodness would itself,
     And sweet affection prove the spring of woe!

     Home.

     O thou pale orb that silent shines
     While care-untroubled mortals sleep!
     Thou seest a wretch who inly pines.
     And wanders here to wail and weep!
     With woe I nightly vigils keep,
     Beneath thy wan, unwarming beam;
     And mourn, in lamentation deep,
     How life and love are all a dream!

     I joyless view thy rays adorn
     The faintly-marked, distant hill;
     I joyless view thy trembling horn,
     Reflected in the gurgling rill:
     My fondly-fluttering heart, be still!
     Thou busy pow'r, remembrance, cease!
     Ah! must the agonizing thrill
     For ever bar returning peace!

     No idly-feign'd, poetic pains,
     My sad, love-lorn lamentings claim:
     No shepherd's pipe-Arcadian strains;
     No fabled tortures, quaint and tame.
     The plighted faith, the mutual flame,
     The oft-attested pow'rs above,
     The promis'd father's tender name;
     These were the pledges of my love!

     Encircled in her clasping arms,
     How have the raptur'd moments flown!
     How have I wish'd for fortune's charms,
     For her dear sake, and her's alone!
     And, must I think it! is she gone,
     My secret heart's exulting boast?
     And does she heedless hear my groan?
     And is she ever, ever lost?

     Oh! can she bear so base a heart,
     So lost to honour, lost to truth,
     As from the fondest lover part,
     The plighted husband of her youth?
     Alas! life's path may be unsmooth!
     Her way may lie thro' rough distress!
     Then, who her pangs and pains will soothe
     Her sorrows share, and make them less?

     Ye winged hours that o'er us pass'd,
     Enraptur'd more, the more enjoy'd,
     Your dear remembrance in my breast
     My fondly-treasur'd thoughts employ'd:
     That breast, how dreary now, and void,
     For her too scanty once of room!
     Ev'n ev'ry ray of hope destroy'd,
     And not a wish to gild the gloom!

     The morn, that warns th' approaching day,
     Awakes me up to toil and woe;
     I see the hours in long array,
     That I must suffer, lingering, slow:
     Full many a pang, and many a throe,
     Keen recollection's direful train,
     Must wring my soul, were Phoebus, low,
     Shall kiss the distant western main.

     And when my nightly couch I try,
     Sore harass'd out with care and grief,
     My toil-beat nerves, and tear-worn eye,
     Keep watchings with the nightly thief:
     Or if I slumber, fancy, chief,
     Reigns, haggard—wild, in sore affright:
     Ev'n day, all-bitter, brings relief
     From such a horror-breathing night.

     O thou bright queen, who o'er th' expanse
     Now highest reign'st, with boundless sway
     Oft has thy silent-marking glance
     Observ'd us, fondly-wand'ring, stray!
     The time, unheeded, sped away,
     While love's luxurious pulse beat high,
     Beneath thy silver-gleaming ray,
     To mark the mutual-kindling eye.

     Oh! scenes in strong remembrance set!
     Scenes, never, never to return!
     Scenes, if in stupor I forget,
     Again I feel, again I burn!
     From ev'ry joy and pleasure torn,
     Life's weary vale I'll wander thro';
     And hopeless, comfortless, I'll mourn
     A faithless woman's broken vow!

      Despondency: An Ode
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Oppress'd with grief, oppress'd with care,
     A burden more than I can bear,
     I set me down and sigh;
     O life! thou art a galling load,
     Along a rough, a weary road,
     To wretches such as I!
     Dim backward as I cast my view,
     What sick'ning scenes appear!
     What sorrows yet may pierce me through,
     Too justly I may fear!
     Still caring, despairing,
     Must be my bitter doom;
     My woes here shall close ne'er
     But with the closing tomb!

     Happy! ye sons of busy life,
     Who, equal to the bustling strife,
     No other view regard!
     Ev'n when the wished end's denied,
     Yet while the busy means are plied,
     They bring their own reward:
     Whilst I, a hope-abandon'd wight,
     Unfitted with an aim,
     Meet ev'ry sad returning night,
     And joyless morn the same!
     You, bustling, and justling,
     Forget each grief and pain;
     I, listless, yet restless,
     Find ev'ry prospect vain.

     How blest the solitary's lot,
     Who, all-forgetting, all forgot,
     Within his humble cell,
     The cavern, wild with tangling roots,
     Sits o'er his newly gather'd fruits,
     Beside his crystal well!
     Or haply, to his ev'ning thought,
     By unfrequented stream,
     The ways of men are distant brought,
     A faint, collected dream;
     While praising, and raising
     His thoughts to heav'n on high,
     As wand'ring, meand'ring,
     He views the solemn sky.

     Than I, no lonely hermit plac'd
     Where never human footstep trac'd,
     Less fit to play the part,
     The lucky moment to improve,
     And just to stop, and just to move,
     With self-respecting art:
     But ah! those pleasures, loves, and joys,
     Which I too keenly taste,
     The solitary can despise,
     Can want, and yet be blest!
     He needs not, he heeds not,
     Or human love or hate;
     Whilst I here must cry here
     At perfidy ingrate!

     O, enviable, early days,
     When dancing thoughtless pleasure's maze,
     To care, to guilt unknown!
     How ill exchang'd for riper times,
     To feel the follies, or the crimes,
     Of others, or my own!
     Ye tiny elves that guiltless sport,
     Like linnets in the bush,
     Ye little know the ills ye court,
     When manhood is your wish!
     The losses, the crosses,
     That active man engage;
     The fears all, the tears all,
     Of dim declining age!

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Recommending a Boy.

     Mossgaville, May 3, 1786.

     I hold it, sir, my bounden duty
     To warn you how that Master Tootie,
     Alias, Laird M'Gaun,
     Was here to hire yon lad away
     'Bout whom ye spak the tither day,
     An' wad hae don't aff han';

     But lest he learn the callan tricks—
     An' faith I muckle doubt him—
     Like scrapin out auld Crummie's nicks,
     An' tellin lies about them;
     As lieve then, I'd have then
     Your clerkship he should sair,
     If sae be ye may be
     Not fitted otherwhere.

     Altho' I say't, he's gleg enough,
     An' 'bout a house that's rude an' rough,
     The boy might learn to swear;
     But then, wi' you, he'll be sae taught,
     An' get sic fair example straught,
     I hae na ony fear.
     Ye'll catechise him, every quirk,
     An' shore him weel wi' hell;
     An' gar him follow to the kirk—
     Aye when ye gang yoursel.
     If ye then maun be then
     Frae hame this comin' Friday,
     Then please, sir, to lea'e, sir,
     The orders wi' your lady.

     My word of honour I hae gi'en,
     In Paisley John's, that night at e'en,
     To meet the warld's worm;
     To try to get the twa to gree,
     An' name the airles an' the fee,
     In legal mode an' form:
     I ken he weel a snick can draw,
     When simple bodies let him:
     An' if a Devil be at a',
     In faith he's sure to get him.
     To phrase you and praise you,
     Ye ken your Laureat scorns:
     The pray'r still you share still
     Of grateful Minstrel Burns.

      Epistle To A Young Friend
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     May __, 1786.

     I Lang hae thought, my youthfu' friend,
     A something to have sent you,
     Tho' it should serve nae ither end
     Than just a kind memento:
     But how the subject-theme may gang,
     Let time and chance determine;
     Perhaps it may turn out a sang:
     Perhaps turn out a sermon.

     Ye'll try the world soon, my lad;
     And, Andrew dear, believe me,
     Ye'll find mankind an unco squad,
     And muckle they may grieve ye:
     For care and trouble set your thought,
     Ev'n when your end's attained;
     And a' your views may come to nought,
     Where ev'ry nerve is strained.

     I'll no say, men are villains a';
     The real, harden'd wicked,
     Wha hae nae check but human law,
     Are to a few restricked;
     But, Och! mankind are unco weak,
     An' little to be trusted;
     If self the wavering balance shake,
     It's rarely right adjusted!

     Yet they wha fa' in fortune's strife,
     Their fate we shouldna censure;
     For still, th' important end of life
     They equally may answer;
     A man may hae an honest heart,
     Tho' poortith hourly stare him;
     A man may tak a neibor's part,
     Yet hae nae cash to spare him.

     Aye free, aff-han', your story tell,
     When wi' a bosom crony;
     But still keep something to yoursel',
     Ye scarcely tell to ony:
     Conceal yoursel' as weel's ye can
     Frae critical dissection;
     But keek thro' ev'ry other man,
     Wi' sharpen'd, sly inspection.

     The sacred lowe o' weel-plac'd love,
     Luxuriantly indulge it;
     But never tempt th' illicit rove,
     Tho' naething should divulge it:
     I waive the quantum o' the sin,
     The hazard of concealing;
     But, Och! it hardens a' within,
     And petrifies the feeling!

     To catch dame Fortune's golden smile,
     Assiduous wait upon her;
     And gather gear by ev'ry wile
     That's justified by honour;
     Not for to hide it in a hedge,
     Nor for a train attendant;
     But for the glorious privilege
     Of being independent.

     The fear o' hell's a hangman's whip,
     To haud the wretch in order;
     But where ye feel your honour grip,
     Let that aye be your border;
     Its slightest touches, instant pause—
     Debar a' side-pretences;
     And resolutely keep its laws,
     Uncaring consequences.

     The great Creator to revere,
     Must sure become the creature;
     But still the preaching cant forbear,
     And ev'n the rigid feature:
     Yet ne'er with wits profane to range,
     Be complaisance extended;
     An atheist-laugh's a poor exchange
     For Deity offended!

     When ranting round in pleasure's ring,
     Religion may be blinded;
     Or if she gie a random sting,
     It may be little minded;
     But when on life we're tempest driv'n—
     A conscience but a canker—
     A correspondence fix'd wi' Heav'n,
     Is sure a noble anchor!

     Adieu, dear, amiable youth!
     Your heart can ne'er be wanting!
     May prudence, fortitude, and truth,
     Erect your brow undaunting!
     In ploughman phrase, “God send you speed,”
      Still daily to grow wiser;
     And may ye better reck the rede,
     Then ever did th' adviser!

      Address Of Beelzebub
    </h2>
    <p>
      To the Right Honourable the Earl of Breadalbane, President of the Right
      Honourable and Honourable the Highland Society, which met on the 23rd of
      May last at the Shakespeare, Covent Garden, to concert ways and means to
      frustrate the designs of five hundred Highlanders, who, as the Society
      were informed by Mr. M'Kenzie of Applecross, were so audacious as to
      attempt an escape from their lawful lords and masters whose property they
      were, by emigrating from the lands of Mr. Macdonald of Glengary to the
      wilds of Canada, in search of that fantastic thing—Liberty.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Long life, my Lord, an' health be yours,
     Unskaithed by hunger'd Highland boors;
     Lord grant me nae duddie, desperate beggar,
     Wi' dirk, claymore, and rusty trigger,
     May twin auld Scotland o' a life
     She likes—as butchers like a knife.

     Faith you and Applecross were right
     To keep the Highland hounds in sight:
     I doubt na! they wad bid nae better,
     Than let them ance out owre the water,
     Then up among thae lakes and seas,
     They'll mak what rules and laws they please:
     Some daring Hancocke, or a Franklin,
     May set their Highland bluid a-ranklin;
     Some Washington again may head them,
     Or some Montgomery, fearless, lead them,
     Till God knows what may be effected
     When by such heads and hearts directed,
     Poor dunghill sons of dirt and mire
     May to Patrician rights aspire!
     Nae sage North now, nor sager Sackville,
     To watch and premier o'er the pack vile,—
     An' whare will ye get Howes and Clintons
     To bring them to a right repentance—
     To cowe the rebel generation,
     An' save the honour o' the nation?
     They, an' be d-d! what right hae they
     To meat, or sleep, or light o' day?
     Far less—to riches, pow'r, or freedom,
     But what your lordship likes to gie them?

     But hear, my lord! Glengarry, hear!
     Your hand's owre light to them, I fear;
     Your factors, grieves, trustees, and bailies,
     I canna say but they do gaylies;
     They lay aside a' tender mercies,
     An' tirl the hallions to the birses;
     Yet while they're only poind't and herriet,
     They'll keep their stubborn Highland spirit:
     But smash them! crash them a' to spails,
     An' rot the dyvors i' the jails!
     The young dogs, swinge them to the labour;
     Let wark an' hunger mak them sober!
     The hizzies, if they're aughtlins fawsont,
     Let them in Drury-lane be lesson'd!
     An' if the wives an' dirty brats
     Come thiggin at your doors an' yetts,
     Flaffin wi' duds, an' grey wi' beas',
     Frightin away your ducks an' geese;
     Get out a horsewhip or a jowler,
     The langest thong, the fiercest growler,
     An' gar the tatter'd gypsies pack
     Wi' a' their bastards on their back!
     Go on, my Lord! I lang to meet you,
     An' in my house at hame to greet you;
     Wi' common lords ye shanna mingle,
     The benmost neuk beside the ingle,
     At my right han' assigned your seat,
     'Tween Herod's hip an' Polycrate:
     Or if you on your station tarrow,
     Between Almagro and Pizarro,
     A seat, I'm sure ye're well deservin't;
     An' till ye come—your humble servant,

     Beelzebub.
     June 1st, Anno Mundi, 5790.

      A Dream
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Thoughts, words, and deeds, the Statute blames with reason;
     But surely Dreams were ne'er indicted Treason.
</pre>
    <p>
      On reading, in the public papers, the Laureate's Ode, with the other
      parade of June 4th, 1786, the Author was no sooner dropt asleep, than he
      imagined himself transported to the Birth-day Levee: and, in his dreaming
      fancy, made the following Address:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Guid-Mornin' to our Majesty!
     May Heaven augment your blisses
     On ev'ry new birth-day ye see,
     A humble poet wishes.
     My bardship here, at your Levee
     On sic a day as this is,
     Is sure an uncouth sight to see,
     Amang thae birth-day dresses
     Sae fine this day.

     I see ye're complimented thrang,
     By mony a lord an' lady;
     “God save the King” 's a cuckoo sang
     That's unco easy said aye:
     The poets, too, a venal gang,
     Wi' rhymes weel-turn'd an' ready,
     Wad gar you trow ye ne'er do wrang,
     But aye unerring steady,
     On sic a day.

     For me! before a monarch's face
     Ev'n there I winna flatter;
     For neither pension, post, nor place,
     Am I your humble debtor:
     So, nae reflection on your Grace,
     Your Kingship to bespatter;
     There's mony waur been o' the race,
     And aiblins ane been better
     Than you this day.

     'Tis very true, my sovereign King,
     My skill may weel be doubted;
     But facts are chiels that winna ding,
     An' downa be disputed:
     Your royal nest, beneath your wing,
     Is e'en right reft and clouted,
     And now the third part o' the string,
     An' less, will gang aboot it
     Than did ae day.^1

     Far be't frae me that I aspire
     To blame your legislation,
     Or say, ye wisdom want, or fire,
     To rule this mighty nation:
     But faith! I muckle doubt, my sire,
     Ye've trusted ministration
     To chaps wha in barn or byre
     Wad better fill'd their station
     Than courts yon day.

     And now ye've gien auld Britain peace,
     Her broken shins to plaister,
     Your sair taxation does her fleece,
     Till she has scarce a tester:
     For me, thank God, my life's a lease,
     Nae bargain wearin' faster,
     Or, faith! I fear, that, wi' the geese,
     I shortly boost to pasture
     I' the craft some day.

     [Footnote 1: The American colonies had recently been lost.]

     I'm no mistrusting Willie Pitt,
     When taxes he enlarges,
     (An' Will's a true guid fallow's get,
     A name not envy spairges),
     That he intends to pay your debt,
     An' lessen a' your charges;
     But, God-sake! let nae saving fit
     Abridge your bonie barges
     An'boats this day.

     Adieu, my Liege; may freedom geck
     Beneath your high protection;
     An' may ye rax Corruption's neck,
     And gie her for dissection!
     But since I'm here, I'll no neglect,
     In loyal, true affection,
     To pay your Queen, wi' due respect,
     May fealty an' subjection
     This great birth-day.

     Hail, Majesty most Excellent!
     While nobles strive to please ye,
     Will ye accept a compliment,
     A simple poet gies ye?
     Thae bonie bairntime, Heav'n has lent,
     Still higher may they heeze ye
     In bliss, till fate some day is sent
     For ever to release ye
     Frae care that day.

     For you, young Potentate o'Wales,
     I tell your highness fairly,
     Down Pleasure's stream, wi' swelling sails,
     I'm tauld ye're driving rarely;
     But some day ye may gnaw your nails,
     An' curse your folly sairly,
     That e'er ye brak Diana's pales,
     Or rattl'd dice wi' Charlie
     By night or day.

     Yet aft a ragged cowt's been known,
     To mak a noble aiver;
     So, ye may doucely fill the throne,
     For a'their clish-ma-claver:
     There, him^2 at Agincourt wha shone,
     Few better were or braver:
     And yet, wi' funny, queer Sir John,^3
     He was an unco shaver
     For mony a day.

     For you, right rev'rend Osnaburg,
     Nane sets the lawn-sleeve sweeter,
     Altho' a ribbon at your lug
     Wad been a dress completer:
     As ye disown yon paughty dog,
     That bears the keys of Peter,
     Then swith! an' get a wife to hug,
     Or trowth, ye'll stain the mitre
     Some luckless day!

     Young, royal Tarry-breeks, I learn,
     Ye've lately come athwart her—
     A glorious galley,^4 stem and stern,
     Weel rigg'd for Venus' barter;
     But first hang out, that she'll discern,
     Your hymeneal charter;
     Then heave aboard your grapple airn,
     An' large upon her quarter,
     Come full that day.

     Ye, lastly, bonie blossoms a',
     Ye royal lasses dainty,
     Heav'n mak you guid as well as braw,
     An' gie you lads a-plenty!
     But sneer na British boys awa!
     For kings are unco scant aye,
     An' German gentles are but sma',
     They're better just than want aye
     On ony day.

     [Footnote 2: King Henry V.—R.B.]

     [Footnote 3: Sir John Falstaff, vid. Shakespeare.—R. B.]

     [Footnote 4: Alluding to the newspaper account of a certain
     Royal sailor's amour.—R. B. This was Prince William Henry,
     third son of George III, afterward King William IV.]

     Gad bless you a'! consider now,
     Ye're unco muckle dautit;
     But ere the course o' life be through,
     It may be bitter sautit:
     An' I hae seen their coggie fou,
     That yet hae tarrow't at it.
     But or the day was done, I trow,
     The laggen they hae clautit
     Fu' clean that day.

    <h2>
      A Dedication
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     To Gavin Hamilton, Esq.

     Expect na, sir, in this narration,
     A fleechin, fleth'rin Dedication,
     To roose you up, an' ca' you guid,
     An' sprung o' great an' noble bluid,
     Because ye're surnam'd like His Grace—
     Perhaps related to the race:
     Then, when I'm tir'd—and sae are ye,
     Wi' mony a fulsome, sinfu' lie,
     Set up a face how I stop short,
     For fear your modesty be hurt.

     This may do—maun do, sir, wi' them wha
     Maun please the great folk for a wamefou;
     For me! sae laigh I need na bow,
     For, Lord be thankit, I can plough;
     And when I downa yoke a naig,
     Then, Lord be thankit, I can beg;
     Sae I shall say—an' that's nae flatt'rin—
     It's just sic Poet an' sic Patron.

     The Poet, some guid angel help him,
     Or else, I fear, some ill ane skelp him!
     He may do weel for a' he's done yet,
     But only—he's no just begun yet.

     The Patron (sir, ye maun forgie me;
     I winna lie, come what will o' me),
     On ev'ry hand it will allow'd be,
     He's just—nae better than he should be.

     I readily and freely grant,
     He downa see a poor man want;
     What's no his ain, he winna tak it;
     What ance he says, he winna break it;
     Ought he can lend he'll no refus't,
     Till aft his guidness is abus'd;
     And rascals whiles that do him wrang,
     Ev'n that, he does na mind it lang;
     As master, landlord, husband, father,
     He does na fail his part in either.

     But then, nae thanks to him for a'that;
     Nae godly symptom ye can ca' that;
     It's naething but a milder feature
     Of our poor, sinfu' corrupt nature:
     Ye'll get the best o' moral works,
     'Mang black Gentoos, and pagan Turks,
     Or hunters wild on Ponotaxi,
     Wha never heard of orthodoxy.
     That he's the poor man's friend in need,
     The gentleman in word and deed,
     It's no thro' terror of damnation;
     It's just a carnal inclination.

     Morality, thou deadly bane,
     Thy tens o' thousands thou hast slain!
     Vain is his hope, whase stay an' trust is
     In moral mercy, truth, and justice!

     No—stretch a point to catch a plack:
     Abuse a brother to his back;
     Steal through the winnock frae a whore,
     But point the rake that taks the door;
     Be to the poor like ony whunstane,
     And haud their noses to the grunstane;
     Ply ev'ry art o' legal thieving;
     No matter—stick to sound believing.

     Learn three-mile pray'rs, an' half-mile graces,
     Wi' weel-spread looves, an' lang, wry faces;
     Grunt up a solemn, lengthen'd groan,
     And damn a' parties but your own;
     I'll warrant they ye're nae deceiver,
     A steady, sturdy, staunch believer.

     O ye wha leave the springs o' Calvin,
     For gumlie dubs of your ain delvin!
     Ye sons of Heresy and Error,
     Ye'll some day squeel in quaking terror,
     When Vengeance draws the sword in wrath.
     And in the fire throws the sheath;
     When Ruin, with his sweeping besom,
     Just frets till Heav'n commission gies him;
     While o'er the harp pale Misery moans,
     And strikes the ever-deep'ning tones,
     Still louder shrieks, and heavier groans!

     Your pardon, sir, for this digression:
     I maist forgat my Dedication;
     But when divinity comes 'cross me,
     My readers still are sure to lose me.

     So, sir, you see 'twas nae daft vapour;
     But I maturely thought it proper,
     When a' my works I did review,
     To dedicate them, sir, to you:
     Because (ye need na tak it ill),
     I thought them something like yoursel'.

     Then patronize them wi' your favor,
     And your petitioner shall ever—
     I had amaist said, ever pray,
     But that's a word I need na say;
     For prayin, I hae little skill o't,
     I'm baith dead-sweer, an' wretched ill o't;
     But I'se repeat each poor man's pray'r,
     That kens or hears about you, sir—

     “May ne'er Misfortune's gowling bark,
     Howl thro' the dwelling o' the clerk!
     May ne'er his genrous, honest heart,
     For that same gen'rous spirit smart!
     May Kennedy's far-honour'd name
     Lang beet his hymeneal flame,
     Till Hamiltons, at least a dizzen,
     Are frae their nuptial labours risen:
     Five bonie lasses round their table,
     And sev'n braw fellows, stout an' able,
     To serve their king an' country weel,
     By word, or pen, or pointed steel!
     May health and peace, with mutual rays,
     Shine on the ev'ning o' his days;
     Till his wee, curlie John's ier-oe,
     When ebbing life nae mair shall flow,
     The last, sad, mournful rites bestow!”

     I will not wind a lang conclusion,
     With complimentary effusion;
     But, whilst your wishes and endeavours
     Are blest with Fortune's smiles and favours,
     I am, dear sir, with zeal most fervent,
     Your much indebted, humble servant.

     But if (which Pow'rs above prevent)
     That iron-hearted carl, Want,
     Attended, in his grim advances,
     By sad mistakes, and black mischances,
     While hopes, and joys, and pleasures fly him,
     Make you as poor a dog as I am,
     Your humble servant then no more;
     For who would humbly serve the poor?
     But, by a poor man's hopes in Heav'n!
     While recollection's pow'r is giv'n—
     If, in the vale of humble life,
     The victim sad of fortune's strife,
     I, thro' the tender-gushing tear,
     Should recognise my master dear;
     If friendless, low, we meet together,
     Then, sir, your hand—my Friend and Brother!

<pre xml:space="preserve">     A' ye wha live by sowps o' drink,
     A' ye wha live by crambo-clink,
     A' ye wha live and never think,
     Come, mourn wi' me!
     Our billie 's gien us a' a jink,
     An' owre the sea!

     Lament him a' ye rantin core,
     Wha dearly like a random splore;
     Nae mair he'll join the merry roar;
     In social key;
     For now he's taen anither shore.
     An' owre the sea!

     The bonie lasses weel may wiss him,
     And in their dear petitions place him:
     The widows, wives, an' a' may bless him
     Wi' tearfu' e'e;
     For weel I wat they'll sairly miss him
     That's owre the sea!

     O Fortune, they hae room to grumble!
     Hadst thou taen aff some drowsy bummle,
     Wha can do nought but fyke an' fumble,
     'Twad been nae plea;
     But he was gleg as ony wumble,
     That's owre the sea!

     Auld, cantie Kyle may weepers wear,
     An' stain them wi' the saut, saut tear;
     'Twill mak her poor auld heart, I fear,
     In flinders flee:
     He was her Laureat mony a year,
     That's owre the sea!

     He saw Misfortune's cauld nor-west
     Lang mustering up a bitter blast;
     A jillet brak his heart at last,
     Ill may she be!
     So, took a berth afore the mast,
     An' owre the sea.

     To tremble under Fortune's cummock,
     On a scarce a bellyfu' o' drummock,
     Wi' his proud, independent stomach,
     Could ill agree;
     So, row't his hurdies in a hammock,
     An' owre the sea.

     He ne'er was gien to great misguidin,
     Yet coin his pouches wad na bide in;
     Wi' him it ne'er was under hiding;
     He dealt it free:
     The Muse was a' that he took pride in,
     That's owre the sea.

     Jamaica bodies, use him weel,
     An' hap him in cozie biel:
     Ye'll find him aye a dainty chiel,
     An' fou o' glee:
     He wad na wrang'd the vera deil,
     That's owre the sea.

     Farewell, my rhyme-composing billie!
     Your native soil was right ill-willie;
     But may ye flourish like a lily,
     Now bonilie!
     I'll toast you in my hindmost gillie,
     Tho' owre the sea!

      A Bard's Epitaph
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Is there a whim-inspired fool,
     Owre fast for thought, owre hot for rule,
     Owre blate to seek, owre proud to snool,
     Let him draw near;
     And owre this grassy heap sing dool,
     And drap a tear.

     Is there a bard of rustic song,
     Who, noteless, steals the crowds among,
     That weekly this area throng,
     O, pass not by!
     But, with a frater-feeling strong,
     Here, heave a sigh.

     Is there a man, whose judgment clear
     Can others teach the course to steer,
     Yet runs, himself, life's mad career,
     Wild as the wave,
     Here pause—and, thro' the starting tear,
     Survey this grave.

     The poor inhabitant below
     Was quick to learn the wise to know,
     And keenly felt the friendly glow,
     And softer flame;
     But thoughtless follies laid him low,
     And stain'd his name!

     Reader, attend! whether thy soul
     Soars fancy's flights beyond the pole,
     Or darkling grubs this earthly hole,
     In low pursuit:
     Know, prudent, cautious, self-control
     Is wisdom's root.

     Epitaph For Robert Aiken, Esq.

     Know thou, O stranger to the fame
     Of this much lov'd, much honoured name!
     (For none that knew him need be told)
     A warmer heart death ne'er made cold.

     Epitaph For Gavin Hamilton, Esq.

     The poor man weeps—here Gavin sleeps,
     Whom canting wretches blam'd;
     But with such as he, where'er he be,
     May I be sav'd or damn'd!

      The Lass O' Ballochmyle
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Tune—“Ettrick Banks.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     'Twas even—the dewy fields were green,
     On every blade the pearls hang;
     The zephyr wanton'd round the bean,
     And bore its fragrant sweets alang:
     In ev'ry glen the mavis sang,
     All nature list'ning seem'd the while,
     Except where greenwood echoes rang,
     Amang the braes o' Ballochmyle.

     With careless step I onward stray'd,
     My heart rejoic'd in nature's joy,
     When, musing in a lonely glade,
     A maiden fair I chanc'd to spy:
     Her look was like the morning's eye,
     Her air like nature's vernal smile:
     Perfection whisper'd, passing by,
     “Behold the lass o' Ballochmyle!”

     Fair is the morn in flowery May,
     And sweet is night in autumn mild;
     When roving thro' the garden gay,
     Or wand'ring in the lonely wild:
     But woman, nature's darling child!
     There all her charms she does compile;
     Even there her other works are foil'd
     By the bonie lass o' Ballochmyle.

     O, had she been a country maid,
     And I the happy country swain,
     Tho' shelter'd in the lowest shed
     That ever rose on Scotland's plain!
     Thro' weary winter's wind and rain,
     With joy, with rapture, I would toil;
     And nightly to my bosom strain
     The bonie lass o' Ballochmyle.

     Then pride might climb the slipp'ry steep,
     Where frame and honours lofty shine;
     And thirst of gold might tempt the deep,
     Or downward seek the Indian mine:
     Give me the cot below the pine,
     To tend the flocks or till the soil;
     And ev'ry day have joys divine
     With the bonie lass o' Ballochmyle.

      Stanzas On Naething
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Extempore Epistle to Gavin Hamilton, Esq.

     To you, sir, this summons I've sent,
     Pray, whip till the pownie is freathing;
     But if you demand what I want,
     I honestly answer you—naething.

     Ne'er scorn a poor Poet like me,
     For idly just living and breathing,
     While people of every degree
     Are busy employed about—naething.

     Poor Centum-per-centum may fast,
     And grumble his hurdies their claithing,
     He'll find, when the balance is cast,
     He's gane to the devil for-naething.

     The courtier cringes and bows,
     Ambition has likewise its plaything;
     A coronet beams on his brows;
     And what is a coronet-naething.

     Some quarrel the Presbyter gown,
     Some quarrel Episcopal graithing;
     But every good fellow will own
     Their quarrel is a' about—naething.

     The lover may sparkle and glow,
     Approaching his bonie bit gay thing:
     But marriage will soon let him know
     He's gotten—a buskit up naething.

     The Poet may jingle and rhyme,
     In hopes of a laureate wreathing,
     And when he has wasted his time,
     He's kindly rewarded wi'—naething.

     The thundering bully may rage,
     And swagger and swear like a heathen;
     But collar him fast, I'll engage,
     You'll find that his courage is—naething.

     Last night wi' a feminine whig—
     A Poet she couldna put faith in;
     But soon we grew lovingly big,
     I taught her, her terrors were naething.

     Her whigship was wonderful pleased,
     But charmingly tickled wi' ae thing,
     Her fingers I lovingly squeezed,
     And kissed her, and promised her—naething.

     The priest anathemas may threat—
     Predicament, sir, that we're baith in;
     But when honour's reveille is beat,
     The holy artillery's naething.

     And now I must mount on the wave—
     My voyage perhaps there is death in;
     But what is a watery grave?
     The drowning a Poet is naething.

     And now, as grim death's in my thought,
     To you, sir, I make this bequeathing;
     My service as long as ye've ought,
     And my friendship, by God, when ye've naething.

      Nature's Law—A Poem
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">          Humbly inscribed to Gavin Hamilton, Esq.

          Great Nature spoke: observant man obey'd—Pope.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Let other heroes boast their scars,
     The marks of sturt and strife:
     And other poets sing of wars,
     The plagues of human life:

     Shame fa' the fun, wi' sword and gun
     To slap mankind like lumber!
     I sing his name, and nobler fame,
     Wha multiplies our number.

     Great Nature spoke, with air benign,
     “Go on, ye human race;
     This lower world I you resign;
     Be fruitful and increase.
     The liquid fire of strong desire
     I've pour'd it in each bosom;
     Here, on this had, does Mankind stand,
     And there is Beauty's blossom.”

     The Hero of these artless strains,
     A lowly bard was he,
     Who sung his rhymes in Coila's plains,
     With meikle mirth an'glee;
     Kind Nature's care had given his share
     Large, of the flaming current;
     And, all devout, he never sought
     To stem the sacred torrent.

     He felt the powerful, high behest
     Thrill, vital, thro' and thro';
     And sought a correspondent breast,
     To give obedience due:
     Propitious Powers screen'd the young flow'rs,
     From mildews of abortion;
     And low! the bard—a great reward—
     Has got a double portion!

     Auld cantie Coil may count the day,
     As annual it returns,
     The third of Libra's equal sway,
     That gave another Burns,
     With future rhymes, an' other times,
     To emulate his sire:
     To sing auld Coil in nobler style
     With more poetic fire.

     Ye Powers of peace, and peaceful song,
     Look down with gracious eyes;
     And bless auld Coila, large and long,
     With multiplying joys;
     Lang may she stand to prop the land,
     The flow'r of ancient nations;
     And Burnses spring, her fame to sing,
     To endless generations!

      Song—Willie Chalmers
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Chalmers, a gentleman in Ayrshire, a particular friend of mine, asked
      me to write a poetic epistle to a young lady, his Dulcinea. I had seen
      her, but was scarcely acquainted with her, and wrote as follows:—
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Wi' braw new branks in mickle pride,
     And eke a braw new brechan,
     My Pegasus I'm got astride,
     And up Parnassus pechin;
     Whiles owre a bush wi' donwward crush,
     The doited beastie stammers;
     Then up he gets, and off he sets,
     For sake o' Willie Chalmers.

     I doubt na, lass, that weel ken'd name
     May cost a pair o' blushes;
     I am nae stranger to your fame,
     Nor his warm urged wishes.
     Your bonie face sae mild and sweet,
     His honest heart enamours,
     And faith ye'll no be lost a whit,
     Tho' wair'd on Willie Chalmers.

     Auld Truth hersel' might swear yer'e fair,
     And Honour safely back her;
     And Modesty assume your air,
     And ne'er a ane mistak her:
     And sic twa love-inspiring een
     Might fire even holy palmers;
     Nae wonder then they've fatal been
     To honest Willie Chalmers.

     I doubt na fortune may you shore
     Some mim-mou'd pouther'd priestie,
     Fu' lifted up wi' Hebrew lore,
     And band upon his breastie:
     But oh! what signifies to you
     His lexicons and grammars;
     The feeling heart's the royal blue,
     And that's wi' Willie Chalmers.

     Some gapin', glowrin' countra laird
     May warsle for your favour;
     May claw his lug, and straik his beard,
     And hoast up some palaver:
     My bonie maid, before ye wed
     Sic clumsy-witted hammers,
     Seek Heaven for help, and barefit skelp
     Awa wi' Willie Chalmers.

     Forgive the Bard! my fond regard
     For ane that shares my bosom,
     Inspires my Muse to gie 'm his dues
     For deil a hair I roose him.
     May powers aboon unite you soon,
     And fructify your amours,—
     And every year come in mair dear
     To you and Willie Chalmers.

     An' sairly thole their mother's ban
     Afore the howdy.

     This leads me on to tell for sport,
     How I did wi' the Session sort;
     Auld Clinkum, at the inner port,
     Cried three times, “Robin!
     Come hither lad, and answer for't,
     Ye're blam'd for jobbin!”

     Wi' pinch I put a Sunday's face on,
     An' snoov'd awa before the Session:
     I made an open, fair confession—
     I scorn't to lee,
     An' syne Mess John, beyond expression,
     Fell foul o' me.

     A fornicator-loun he call'd me,
     An' said my faut frae bliss expell'd me;
     I own'd the tale was true he tell'd me,
     “But, what the matter?
     (Quo' I) I fear unless ye geld me,
     I'll ne'er be better!”

     “Geld you! (quo' he) an' what for no?
     If that your right hand, leg or toe
     Should ever prove your sp'ritual foe,
     You should remember
     To cut it aff—an' what for no
     Your dearest member?”

     “Na, na, (quo' I,) I'm no for that,
     Gelding's nae better than 'tis ca't;
     I'd rather suffer for my faut
     A hearty flewit,
     As sair owre hip as ye can draw't,
     Tho' I should rue it.

     “Or, gin ye like to end the bother,
     To please us a'—I've just ae ither—
     When next wi' yon lass I forgather,
     Whate'er betide it,
     I'll frankly gie her 't a' thegither,
     An' let her guide it.”

     But, sir, this pleas'd them warst of a',
     An' therefore, Tam, when that I saw,
     I said “Gude night,” an' cam' awa',
     An' left the Session;
     I saw they were resolved a'
     On my oppression.

    <h2>
      The Brigs Of Ayr
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     A Poem

          Inscribed to John Ballantine, Esq., Ayr.

     The simple Bard, rough at the rustic plough,
     Learning his tuneful trade from ev'ry bough;
     The chanting linnet, or the mellow thrush,
     Hailing the setting sun, sweet, in the green thorn bush;
     The soaring lark, the perching red-breast shrill,
     Or deep-ton'd plovers grey, wild-whistling o'er the hill;
     Shall he—nurst in the peasant's lowly shed,
     To hardy independence bravely bred,
     By early poverty to hardship steel'd.
     And train'd to arms in stern Misfortune's field—
     Shall he be guilty of their hireling crimes,
     The servile, mercenary Swiss of rhymes?
     Or labour hard the panegyric close,
     With all the venal soul of dedicating prose?
     No! though his artless strains he rudely sings,
     And throws his hand uncouthly o'er the strings,
     He glows with all the spirit of the Bard,
     Fame, honest fame, his great, his dear reward.
     Still, if some patron's gen'rous care he trace,
     Skill'd in the secret, to bestow with grace;
     When Ballantine befriends his humble name,
     And hands the rustic stranger up to fame,
     With heartfelt throes his grateful bosom swells,
     The godlike bliss, to give, alone excels.

     'Twas when the stacks get on their winter hap,
     And thack and rape secure the toil-won crap;
     Potatoe-bings are snugged up frae skaith
     O' coming Winter's biting, frosty breath;
     The bees, rejoicing o'er their summer toils,
     Unnumber'd buds an' flow'rs' delicious spoils,
     Seal'd up with frugal care in massive waxen piles,
     Are doom'd by Man, that tyrant o'er the weak,
     The death o' devils, smoor'd wi' brimstone reek:
     The thundering guns are heard on ev'ry side,
     The wounded coveys, reeling, scatter wide;
     The feather'd field-mates, bound by Nature's tie,
     Sires, mothers, children, in one carnage lie:
     (What warm, poetic heart but inly bleeds,
     And execrates man's savage, ruthless deeds!)
     Nae mair the flow'r in field or meadow springs,
     Nae mair the grove with airy concert rings,
     Except perhaps the Robin's whistling glee,
     Proud o' the height o' some bit half-lang tree:
     The hoary morns precede the sunny days,
     Mild, calm, serene, wide spreads the noontide blaze,
     While thick the gosamour waves wanton in the rays.

     'Twas in that season, when a simple Bard,
     Unknown and poor—simplicity's reward!—
     Ae night, within the ancient brugh of Ayr,
     By whim inspir'd, or haply prest wi' care,
     He left his bed, and took his wayward route,
     And down by Simpson's^1 wheel'd the left about:
     (Whether impell'd by all-directing Fate,
     To witness what I after shall narrate;
     Or whether, rapt in meditation high,
     He wander'd out, he knew not where or why:)
     The drowsy Dungeon-clock^2 had number'd two,
     and Wallace Tower^2 had sworn the fact was true:
     The tide-swoln firth, with sullen-sounding roar,
     Through the still night dash'd hoarse along the shore.
     All else was hush'd as Nature's closed e'e;
     The silent moon shone high o'er tower and tree;
     The chilly frost, beneath the silver beam,
     Crept, gently-crusting, o'er the glittering stream—
     When, lo! on either hand the list'ning Bard,
     The clanging sugh of whistling wings is heard;
     Two dusky forms dart through the midnight air;
     Swift as the gos^3 drives on the wheeling hare;
     Ane on th' Auld Brig his airy shape uprears,
     The other flutters o'er the rising piers:
     Our warlock Rhymer instantly dexcried
     The Sprites that owre the Brigs of Ayr preside.
     (That Bards are second-sighted is nae joke,
     And ken the lingo of the sp'ritual folk;
     Fays, Spunkies, Kelpies, a', they can explain them,
     And even the very deils they brawly ken them).
     Auld Brig appear'd of ancient Pictish race,
     The very wrinkles Gothic in his face;
     He seem'd as he wi' Time had warstl'd lang,
     Yet, teughly doure, he bade an unco bang.

     [Footnote 1: A noted tavern at the Auld Brig end.—R. B.]

     [Footnote 2: The two steeples.—R. B.]

     [Footnote 3: The Gos-hawk, or Falcon.—R. B.]

     New Brig was buskit in a braw new coat,
     That he, at Lon'on, frae ane Adams got;
     In 's hand five taper staves as smooth 's a bead,
     Wi' virls and whirlygigums at the head.
     The Goth was stalking round with anxious search,
     Spying the time-worn flaws in every arch;
     It chanc'd his new-come neibor took his e'e,
     And e'en a vexed and angry heart had he!
     Wi' thieveless sneer to see his modish mien,
     He, down the water, gies him this guid-e'en:—
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Auld Brig

     “I doubt na, frien', ye'll think ye're nae sheepshank,
     Ance ye were streekit owre frae bank to bank!
     But gin ye be a brig as auld as me—
     Tho' faith, that date, I doubt, ye'll never see—
     There'll be, if that day come, I'll wad a boddle,
     Some fewer whigmaleeries in your noddle.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     New Brig

     “Auld Vandal! ye but show your little mense,
     Just much about it wi' your scanty sense:
     Will your poor, narrow foot-path of a street,
     Where twa wheel-barrows tremble when they meet,
     Your ruin'd, formless bulk o' stane and lime,
     Compare wi' bonie brigs o' modern time?
     There's men of taste wou'd tak the Ducat stream,^4
     Tho' they should cast the very sark and swim,
     E'er they would grate their feelings wi' the view
     O' sic an ugly, Gothic hulk as you.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Auld Brig

     “Conceited gowk! puff'd up wi' windy pride!
     This mony a year I've stood the flood an' tide;
     And tho' wi' crazy eild I'm sair forfairn,
     I'll be a brig when ye're a shapeless cairn!
     As yet ye little ken about the matter,
     But twa—three winters will inform ye better.
     When heavy, dark, continued, a'-day rains,

     [Footnote 4: A noted ford, just above the Auld Brig.—R. B.]

     Wi' deepening deluges o'erflow the plains;
     When from the hills where springs the brawling Coil,
     Or stately Lugar's mossy fountains boil;
     Or where the Greenock winds his moorland course.
     Or haunted Garpal draws his feeble source,
     Aroused by blustering winds an' spotting thowes,
     In mony a torrent down the snaw-broo rowes;
     While crashing ice, borne on the rolling spate,
     Sweeps dams, an' mills, an' brigs, a' to the gate;
     And from Glenbuck,^5 down to the Ratton-key,^6
     Auld Ayr is just one lengthen'd, tumbling sea—
     Then down ye'll hurl, (deil nor ye never rise!)
     And dash the gumlie jaups up to the pouring skies!
     A lesson sadly teaching, to your cost,
     That Architecture's noble art is lost!”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     New Brig

     “Fine architecture, trowth, I needs must say't o't,
     The Lord be thankit that we've tint the gate o't!
     Gaunt, ghastly, ghaist-alluring edifices,
     Hanging with threat'ning jut, like precipices;
     O'er-arching, mouldy, gloom-inspiring coves,
     Supporting roofs, fantastic, stony groves;
     Windows and doors in nameless sculptures drest
     With order, symmetry, or taste unblest;
     Forms like some bedlam Statuary's dream,
     The craz'd creations of misguided whim;
     Forms might be worshipp'd on the bended knee,
     And still the second dread command be free;
     Their likeness is not found on earth, in air, or sea!
     Mansions that would disgrace the building taste
     Of any mason reptile, bird or beast:
     Fit only for a doited monkish race,
     Or frosty maids forsworn the dear embrace,
     Or cuifs of later times, wha held the notion,
     That sullen gloom was sterling, true devotion:
     Fancies that our guid Brugh denies protection,
     And soon may they expire, unblest wi' resurrection!”

</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Auld Brig

     “O ye, my dear-remember'd, ancient yealings,
     Were ye but here to share my wounded feelings!
     Ye worthy Proveses, an' mony a Bailie,
     Wha in the paths o' righteousness did toil aye;
     Ye dainty Deacons, and ye douce Conveners,
     To whom our moderns are but causey-cleaners
     Ye godly Councils, wha hae blest this town;
     ye godly Brethren o' the sacred gown,
     Wha meekly gie your hurdies to the smiters;
     And (what would now be strange), ye godly Writers;
     A' ye douce folk I've borne aboon the broo,
     Were ye but here, what would ye say or do?
     How would your spirits groan in deep vexation,
     To see each melancholy alteration;
     And, agonising, curse the time and place
     When ye begat the base degen'rate race!
     Nae langer rev'rend men, their country's glory,
     In plain braid Scots hold forth a plain braid story;
     Nae langer thrifty citizens, an' douce,
     Meet owre a pint, or in the Council-house;
     But staumrel, corky-headed, graceless Gentry,
     The herryment and ruin of the country;
     Men, three-parts made by tailors and by barbers,
     Wha waste your weel-hain'd gear on damn'd new brigs and harbours!”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     New Brig

     “Now haud you there! for faith ye've said enough,
     And muckle mair than ye can mak to through.
     As for your Priesthood, I shall say but little,
     Corbies and Clergy are a shot right kittle:
     But, under favour o' your langer beard,
     Abuse o' Magistrates might weel be spar'd;
     To liken them to your auld-warld squad,
     I must needs say, comparisons are odd.
     In Ayr, wag-wits nae mair can hae a handle
     To mouth 'a Citizen,' a term o' scandal;
     Nae mair the Council waddles down the street,
     In all the pomp of ignorant conceit;
     Men wha grew wise priggin owre hops and raisins,
     Or gather'd lib'ral views in Bonds and Seisins:
     If haply Knowledge, on a random tramp,
     Had shor'd them with a glimmer of his lamp,
     And would to Common-sense for once betray'd them,
     Plain, dull Stupidity stept kindly in to aid them.”

     What farther clish-ma-claver aight been said,
     What bloody wars, if Sprites had blood to shed,
     No man can tell; but, all before their sight,
     A fairy train appear'd in order bright;
     Adown the glittering stream they featly danc'd;
     Bright to the moon their various dresses glanc'd:
     They footed o'er the wat'ry glass so neat,
     The infant ice scarce bent beneath their feet:
     While arts of Minstrelsy among them rung,
     And soul-ennobling Bards heroic ditties sung.

     O had M'Lauchlan,^7 thairm-inspiring sage,
     Been there to hear this heavenly band engage,
     When thro' his dear strathspeys they bore with Highland rage;
     Or when they struck old Scotia's melting airs,
     The lover's raptured joys or bleeding cares;
     How would his Highland lug been nobler fir'd,
     And ev'n his matchless hand with finer touch inspir'd!
     No guess could tell what instrument appear'd,
     But all the soul of Music's self was heard;
     Harmonious concert rung in every part,
     While simple melody pour'd moving on the heart.
     The Genius of the Stream in front appears,
     A venerable Chief advanc'd in years;
     His hoary head with water-lilies crown'd,
     His manly leg with garter-tangle bound.
     Next came the loveliest pair in all the ring,
     Sweet female Beauty hand in hand with Spring;
     Then, crown'd with flow'ry hay, came Rural Joy,
     And Summer, with his fervid-beaming eye;

     [Footnote 7: A well-known performer of Scottish music on the
      violin.—R. B.]

     All-cheering Plenty, with her flowing horn,
     Led yellow Autumn wreath'd with nodding corn;
     Then Winter's time-bleach'd locks did hoary show,
     By Hospitality with cloudless brow:
     Next followed Courage with his martial stride,
     From where the Feal wild-woody coverts hide;^8
     Benevolence, with mild, benignant air,
     A female form, came from the tow'rs of Stair;^9
     Learning and Worth in equal measures trode,
     From simple Catrine, their long-lov'd abode:^10
     Last, white-rob'd Peace, crown'd with a hazel wreath,
     To rustic Agriculture did bequeath
     The broken, iron instruments of death:
     At sight of whom our Sprites forgat their kindling wrath.

      Prayer—O Thou Dread Power
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lying at a reverend friend's house one night, the author left the
      following verses in the room where he slept:—
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     O Thou dread Power, who reign'st above,
     I know thou wilt me hear,
     When for this scene of peace and love,
     I make this prayer sincere.

     The hoary Sire—the mortal stroke,
     Long, long be pleas'd to spare;
     To bless this little filial flock,
     And show what good men are.

     She, who her lovely offspring eyes
     With tender hopes and fears,
     O bless her with a mother's joys,
     But spare a mother's tears!

     Their hope, their stay, their darling youth.
     In manhood's dawning blush,
     Bless him, Thou God of love and truth,
     Up to a parent's wish.

     The beauteous, seraph sister-band—
     With earnest tears I pray—
     Thou know'st the snares on ev'ry hand,
     Guide Thou their steps alway.

     When, soon or late, they reach that coast,
     O'er Life's rough ocean driven,
     May they rejoice, no wand'rer lost,
     A family in Heaven!

      Farewell Song To The Banks Of Ayr
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">      Tune—“Roslin Castle.”
 </pre>
    <p>
      “I composed this song as I conveyed my chest so far on my road to
      Greenock, where I was to embark in a few days for Jamaica. I meant it as
      my farewell dirge to my native land.”—R. B.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     The gloomy night is gath'ring fast,
     Loud roars the wild, inconstant blast,
     Yon murky cloud is foul with rain,
     I see it driving o'er the plain;
     The hunter now has left the moor.
     The scatt'red coveys meet secure;
     While here I wander, prest with care,
     Along the lonely banks of Ayr.

     The Autumn mourns her rip'ning corn
     By early Winter's ravage torn;
     Across her placid, azure sky,
     She sees the scowling tempest fly:
     Chill runs my blood to hear it rave;
     I think upon the stormy wave,
     Where many a danger I must dare,
     Far from the bonie banks of Ayr.

     'Tis not the surging billow's roar,
     'Tis not that fatal, deadly shore;
     Tho' death in ev'ry shape appear,
     The wretched have no more to fear:
     But round my heart the ties are bound,
     That heart transpierc'd with many a wound;
     These bleed afresh, those ties I tear,
     To leave the bonie banks of Ayr.

     Farewell, old Coila's hills and dales,
     Her healthy moors and winding vales;
     The scenes where wretched Fancy roves,
     Pursuing past, unhappy loves!
     Farewell, my friends! farewell, my foes!
     My peace with these, my love with those:
     The bursting tears my heart declare—
     Farewell, the bonie banks of Ayr!

     October twenty-third,

     [Footnote 1: At the house of Professor Dugald Stewart.]

     A ne'er-to-be-forgotten day,
     Sae far I sprackl'd up the brae,
     I dinner'd wi' a Lord.

     I've been at drucken writers' feasts,
     Nay, been bitch-fou 'mang godly priests—
     Wi' rev'rence be it spoken!—
     I've even join'd the honour'd jorum,
     When mighty Squireships of the quorum,
     Their hydra drouth did sloken.

     But wi' a Lord!—stand out my shin,
     A Lord—a Peer—an Earl's son!
     Up higher yet, my bonnet
     An' sic a Lord!—lang Scoth ells twa,
     Our Peerage he o'erlooks them a',
     As I look o'er my sonnet.

     But O for Hogarth's magic pow'r!
     To show Sir Bardie's willyart glow'r,
     An' how he star'd and stammer'd,
     When, goavin, as if led wi' branks,
     An' stumpin on his ploughman shanks,
     He in the parlour hammer'd.

     I sidying shelter'd in a nook,
     An' at his Lordship steal't a look,
     Like some portentous omen;
     Except good sense and social glee,
     An' (what surpris'd me) modesty,
     I marked nought uncommon.

     I watch'd the symptoms o' the Great,
     The gentle pride, the lordly state,
     The arrogant assuming;
     The fient a pride, nae pride had he,
     Nor sauce, nor state, that I could see,
     Mair than an honest ploughman.

     Then from his Lordship I shall learn,
     Henceforth to meet with unconcern
     One rank as weel's another;
     Nae honest, worthy man need care
     To meet with noble youthful Daer,
     For he but meets a brother.

      Tam Samson's Elegy
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">          An honest man's the noblest work of God—Pope.
</pre>
    <p>
      When this worthy old sportman went out, last muirfowl season, he supposed
      it was to be, in Ossian's phrase, “the last of his fields,” and expressed
      an ardent wish to die and be buried in the muirs. On this hint the author
      composed his elegy and epitaph.—R.B., 1787.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Has auld Kilmarnock seen the deil?
     Or great Mackinlay^1 thrawn his heel?
     Or Robertson^2 again grown weel,
     To preach an' read?
     “Na' waur than a'!” cries ilka chiel,
     “Tam Samson's dead!”

     [Footnote 1: A certain preacher, a great favourite with the
     million. Vide “The Ordination.” stanza ii.—R. B.]

     [Footnote 2: Another preacher, an equal favourite with the few,
     who was at that time ailing. For him see also “The Ordination,”
      stanza ix.—R.B.]

     Kilmarnock lang may grunt an' grane,
     An' sigh, an' sab, an' greet her lane,
     An' cleed her bairns, man, wife, an' wean,
     In mourning weed;
     To Death she's dearly pay'd the kane—
     Tam Samson's dead!

     The Brethren, o' the mystic level
     May hing their head in woefu' bevel,
     While by their nose the tears will revel,
     Like ony bead;
     Death's gien the Lodge an unco devel;
     Tam Samson's dead!

     When Winter muffles up his cloak,
     And binds the mire like a rock;
     When to the loughs the curlers flock,
     Wi' gleesome speed,
     Wha will they station at the cock?
     Tam Samson's dead!
     When Winter muffles up his cloak,
     He was the king o' a' the core,
     To guard, or draw, or wick a bore,
     Or up the rink like Jehu roar,
     In time o' need;
     But now he lags on Death's hog-score—
     Tam Samson's dead!

     Now safe the stately sawmont sail,
     And trouts bedropp'd wi' crimson hail,
     And eels, weel-ken'd for souple tail,
     And geds for greed,
     Since, dark in Death's fish-creel, we wail
     Tam Samson's dead!

     Rejoice, ye birring paitricks a';
     Ye cootie muircocks, crousely craw;
     Ye maukins, cock your fud fu' braw
     Withouten dread;
     Your mortal fae is now awa;
     Tam Samson's dead!

     That woefu' morn be ever mourn'd,
     Saw him in shooting graith adorn'd,
     While pointers round impatient burn'd,
     Frae couples free'd;
     But och! he gaed and ne'er return'd!
     Tam Samson's dead!

     In vain auld age his body batters,
     In vain the gout his ancles fetters,
     In vain the burns cam down like waters,
     An acre braid!
     Now ev'ry auld wife, greetin, clatters
     “Tam Samson's dead!”

     Owre mony a weary hag he limpit,
     An' aye the tither shot he thumpit,
     Till coward Death behind him jumpit,
     Wi' deadly feid;
     Now he proclaims wi' tout o' trumpet,
     “Tam Samson's dead!”

     When at his heart he felt the dagger,
     He reel'd his wonted bottle-swagger,
     But yet he drew the mortal trigger,
     Wi' weel-aimed heed;
     “Lord, five!” he cry'd, an' owre did stagger—
     Tam Samson's dead!

     Ilk hoary hunter mourn'd a brither;
     Ilk sportsman youth bemoan'd a father;
     Yon auld gray stane, amang the heather,
     Marks out his head;
     Whare Burns has wrote, in rhyming blether,
     “Tam Samson's dead!”

     There, low he lies, in lasting rest;
     Perhaps upon his mould'ring breast
     Some spitefu' muirfowl bigs her nest
     To hatch an' breed:
     Alas! nae mair he'll them molest!
     Tam Samson's dead!

     When August winds the heather wave,
     And sportsmen wander by yon grave,
     Three volleys let his memory crave,
     O' pouther an' lead,
     Till Echo answer frae her cave,
     “Tam Samson's dead!”

     Heav'n rest his saul whare'er he be!
     Is th' wish o' mony mae than me:
     He had twa fauts, or maybe three,
     Yet what remead?
     Ae social, honest man want we:
     Tam Samson's dead!

      Epistle To Major Logan
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Hail, thairm-inspirin', rattlin' Willie!
     Tho' fortune's road be rough an' hilly
     To every fiddling, rhyming billie,
     We never heed,
     But take it like the unback'd filly,
     Proud o' her speed.

     [Footnote 3: Kilmarnock.—R. B.]

     When, idly goavin', whiles we saunter,
     Yirr! fancy barks, awa we canter,
     Up hill, down brae, till some mischanter,
     Some black bog-hole,
     Arrests us; then the scathe an' banter
     We're forced to thole.

     Hale be your heart! hale be your fiddle!
     Lang may your elbuck jink and diddle,
     To cheer you through the weary widdle
     O' this wild warl'.
     Until you on a crummock driddle,
     A grey hair'd carl.

     Come wealth, come poortith, late or soon,
     Heaven send your heart-strings aye in tune,
     And screw your temper-pins aboon
     A fifth or mair
     The melancholious, lazy croon
     O' cankrie care.

     May still your life from day to day,
     Nae “lente largo” in the play,
     But “allegretto forte” gay,
     Harmonious flow,
     A sweeping, kindling, bauld strathspey—
     Encore! Bravo!

     A blessing on the cheery gang
     Wha dearly like a jig or sang,
     An' never think o' right an' wrang
     By square an' rule,
     But, as the clegs o' feeling stang,
     Are wise or fool.

     My hand-waled curse keep hard in chase
     The harpy, hoodock, purse-proud race,
     Wha count on poortith as disgrace;
     Their tuneless hearts,
     May fireside discords jar a base
     To a' their parts.

     But come, your hand, my careless brither,
     I' th' ither warl', if there's anither,
     An' that there is, I've little swither
     About the matter;
     We, cheek for chow, shall jog thegither,
     I'se ne'er bid better.

     We've faults and failings—granted clearly,
     We're frail backsliding mortals merely,
     Eve's bonie squad, priests wyte them sheerly
     For our grand fa';
     But still, but still, I like them dearly—
     God bless them a'!

     Ochone for poor Castalian drinkers,
     When they fa' foul o' earthly jinkers!
     The witching, curs'd, delicious blinkers
     Hae put me hyte,
     And gart me weet my waukrife winkers,
     Wi' girnin'spite.

     By by yon moon!—and that's high swearin—
     An' every star within my hearin!
     An' by her een wha was a dear ane!
     I'll ne'er forget;
     I hope to gie the jads a clearin
     In fair play yet.

     My loss I mourn, but not repent it;
     I'll seek my pursie whare I tint it;
     Ance to the Indies I were wonted,
     Some cantraip hour
     By some sweet elf I'll yet be dinted;
     Then vive l'amour!

     Faites mes baissemains respectueuses,
     To sentimental sister Susie,
     And honest Lucky; no to roose you,
     Ye may be proud,
     That sic a couple Fate allows ye,
     To grace your blood.

     Nae mair at present can I measure,
     An' trowth my rhymin ware's nae treasure;
     But when in Ayr, some half-hour's leisure,
     Be't light, be't dark,
     Sir Bard will do himself the pleasure
     To call at Park.

    <h2>
      A Winter Night
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,
     That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm!
     How shall your houseless heads, and unfed sides,
     Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
     From seasons such as these?—Shakespeare.

     When biting Boreas, fell and dour,
     Sharp shivers thro' the leafless bow'r;
     When Phoebus gies a short-liv'd glow'r,
     Far south the lift,
     Dim-dark'ning thro' the flaky show'r,
     Or whirling drift:

     Ae night the storm the steeples rocked,
     Poor Labour sweet in sleep was locked,
     While burns, wi' snawy wreaths up-choked,
     Wild-eddying swirl;
     Or, thro' the mining outlet bocked,
     Down headlong hurl:

     List'ning the doors an' winnocks rattle,
     I thought me on the ourie cattle,
     Or silly sheep, wha bide this brattle
     O' winter war,
     And thro' the drift, deep-lairing, sprattle
     Beneath a scar.

     Ilk happing bird,—wee, helpless thing!
     That, in the merry months o' spring,
     Delighted me to hear thee sing,
     What comes o' thee?
     Whare wilt thou cow'r thy chittering wing,
     An' close thy e'e?

     Ev'n you, on murdering errands toil'd,
     Lone from your savage homes exil'd,
     The blood-stain'd roost, and sheep-cote spoil'd
     My heart forgets,
     While pityless the tempest wild
     Sore on you beats!

     Now Phoebe in her midnight reign,
     Dark-muff'd, view'd the dreary plain;
     Still crowding thoughts, a pensive train,
     Rose in my soul,
     When on my ear this plantive strain,
     Slow, solemn, stole:—

     “Blow, blow, ye winds, with heavier gust!
     And freeze, thou bitter-biting frost!
     Descend, ye chilly, smothering snows!
     Not all your rage, as now united, shows
     More hard unkindness unrelenting,
     Vengeful malice unrepenting.
     Than heaven-illumin'd Man on brother Man bestows!

     “See stern Oppression's iron grip,
     Or mad Ambition's gory hand,
     Sending, like blood-hounds from the slip,
     Woe, Want, and Murder o'er a land!
     Ev'n in the peaceful rural vale,
     Truth, weeping, tells the mournful tale,
     How pamper'd Luxury, Flatt'ry by her side,
     The parasite empoisoning her ear,
     With all the servile wretches in the rear,
     Looks o'er proud Property, extended wide;
     And eyes the simple, rustic hind,
     Whose toil upholds the glitt'ring show—
     A creature of another kind,
     Some coarser substance, unrefin'd—
     Plac'd for her lordly use thus far, thus vile, below!

     “Where, where is Love's fond, tender throe,
     With lordly Honour's lofty brow,
     The pow'rs you proudly own?
     Is there, beneath Love's noble name,
     Can harbour, dark, the selfish aim,
     To bless himself alone?
     Mark maiden-innocence a prey
     To love-pretending snares:
     This boasted Honour turns away,
     Shunning soft Pity's rising sway,
     Regardless of the tears and unavailing pray'rs!
     Perhaps this hour, in Misery's squalid nest,
     She strains your infant to her joyless breast,
     And with a mother's fears shrinks at the rocking blast!

     “Oh ye! who, sunk in beds of down,
     Feel not a want but what yourselves create,
     Think, for a moment, on his wretched fate,
     Whom friends and fortune quite disown!
     Ill-satisfy'd keen nature's clamorous call,
     Stretch'd on his straw, he lays himself to sleep;
     While through the ragged roof and chinky wall,
     Chill, o'er his slumbers, piles the drifty heap!
     Think on the dungeon's grim confine,
     Where Guilt and poor Misfortune pine!
     Guilt, erring man, relenting view,
     But shall thy legal rage pursue
     The wretch, already crushed low
     By cruel Fortune's undeserved blow?
     Affliction's sons are brothers in distress;
     A brother to relieve, how exquisite the bliss!”

     I heard nae mair, for Chanticleer
     Shook off the pouthery snaw,
     And hail'd the morning with a cheer,
     A cottage-rousing craw.
     But deep this truth impress'd my mind—
     Thro' all His works abroad,
     The heart benevolent and kind
     The most resembles God.

      Song—Yon Wild Mossy Mountains
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Yon wild mossy mountains sae lofty and wide,
     That nurse in their bosom the youth o' the Clyde,
     Where the grouse lead their coveys thro' the heather to feed,
     And the shepherd tends his flock as he pipes on his reed.

     Not Gowrie's rich valley, nor Forth's sunny shores,
     To me hae the charms o'yon wild, mossy moors;
     For there, by a lanely, sequestered stream,
     Besides a sweet lassie, my thought and my dream.

     Amang thae wild mountains shall still be my path,
     Ilk stream foaming down its ain green, narrow strath;
     For there, wi' my lassie, the day lang I rove,
     While o'er us unheeded flie the swift hours o'love.

     She is not the fairest, altho' she is fair;
     O' nice education but sma' is her share;
     Her parentage humble as humble can be;
     But I lo'e the dear lassie because she lo'es me.

     To Beauty what man but maun yield him a prize,
     In her armour of glances, and blushes, and sighs?
     And when wit and refinement hae polish'd her darts,
     They dazzle our een, as they flie to our hearts.

     But kindness, sweet kindness, in the fond-sparkling e'e,
     Has lustre outshining the diamond to me;
     And the heart beating love as I'm clasp'd in her arms,
     O, these are my lassie's all-conquering charms!

    <h2>
      Address To Edinburgh
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Edina! Scotia's darling seat!
     All hail thy palaces and tow'rs,
     Where once, beneath a Monarch's feet,
     Sat Legislation's sov'reign pow'rs:
     From marking wildly scatt'red flow'rs,
     As on the banks of Ayr I stray'd,
     And singing, lone, the lingering hours,
     I shelter in they honour'd shade.

     Here Wealth still swells the golden tide,
     As busy Trade his labours plies;
     There Architecture's noble pride
     Bids elegance and splendour rise:
     Here Justice, from her native skies,
     High wields her balance and her rod;
     There Learning, with his eagle eyes,
     Seeks Science in her coy abode.

     Thy sons, Edina, social, kind,
     With open arms the stranger hail;
     Their views enlarg'd, their liberal mind,
     Above the narrow, rural vale:
     Attentive still to Sorrow's wail,
     Or modest Merit's silent claim;
     And never may their sources fail!
     And never Envy blot their name!

     Thy daughters bright thy walks adorn,
     Gay as the gilded summer sky,
     Sweet as the dewy, milk-white thorn,
     Dear as the raptur'd thrill of joy!
     Fair Burnet strikes th' adoring eye,
     Heaven's beauties on my fancy shine;
     I see the Sire of Love on high,
     And own His work indeed divine!

     There, watching high the least alarms,
     Thy rough, rude fortress gleams afar;
     Like some bold veteran, grey in arms,
     And mark'd with many a seamy scar:
     The pond'rous wall and massy bar,
     Grim—rising o'er the rugged rock,
     Have oft withstood assailing war,
     And oft repell'd th' invader's shock.

     With awe-struck thought, and pitying tears,
     I view that noble, stately Dome,
     Where Scotia's kings of other years,
     Fam'd heroes! had their royal home:
     Alas, how chang'd the times to come!
     Their royal name low in the dust!
     Their hapless race wild-wand'ring roam!
     Tho' rigid Law cries out 'twas just!

     Wild beats my heart to trace your steps,
     Whose ancestors, in days of yore,
     Thro' hostile ranks and ruin'd gaps
     Old Scotia's bloody lion bore:
     Ev'n I who sing in rustic lore,
     Haply my sires have left their shed,
     And fac'd grim Danger's loudest roar,
     Bold-following where your fathers led!

     Edina! Scotia's darling seat!
     All hail thy palaces and tow'rs;
     Where once, beneath a Monarch's feet,
     Sat Legislation's sovereign pow'rs:
     From marking wildly-scatt'red flow'rs,
     As on the banks of Ayr I stray'd,
     And singing, lone, the ling'ring hours,
     I shelter in thy honour'd shade.

      Address To A Haggis
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face,
     Great chieftain o' the pudding-race!
     Aboon them a' yet tak your place,
     Painch, tripe, or thairm:
     Weel are ye wordy o'a grace
     As lang's my arm.

     The groaning trencher there ye fill,
     Your hurdies like a distant hill,
     Your pin was help to mend a mill
     In time o'need,
     While thro' your pores the dews distil
     Like amber bead.

     His knife see rustic Labour dight,
     An' cut you up wi' ready sleight,
     Trenching your gushing entrails bright,
     Like ony ditch;
     And then, O what a glorious sight,
     Warm-reekin', rich!

     Then, horn for horn, they stretch an' strive:
     Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive,
     Till a' their weel-swall'd kytes belyve
     Are bent like drums;
     Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive,
     Bethankit! hums.

     Is there that owre his French ragout
     Or olio that wad staw a sow,
     Or fricassee wad make her spew
     Wi' perfect sconner,
     Looks down wi' sneering, scornfu' view
     On sic a dinner?

     Poor devil! see him owre his trash,
     As feckles as wither'd rash,
     His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash;
     His nieve a nit;
     Thro' blody flood or field to dash,
     O how unfit!

     But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed,
     The trembling earth resounds his tread.
     Clap in his walie nieve a blade,
     He'll mak it whissle;
     An' legs an' arms, an' hands will sned,
     Like taps o' trissle.

     Ye Pow'rs, wha mak mankind your care,
     And dish them out their bill o' fare,
     Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware
     That jaups in luggies;
     But, if ye wish her gratefu' prayer
     Gie her a haggis!

</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Additional Stanzas

     She mourns, sweet tuneful youth, thy hapless fate;
     Tho' all the powers of song thy fancy fired,
     Yet Luxury and Wealth lay by in state,
     And, thankless, starv'd what they so much admired.

     This tribute, with a tear, now gives
     A brother Bard—he can no more bestow:
     But dear to fame thy Song immortal lives,
     A nobler monument than Art can shew.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Inscribed Under Fergusson's Portrait

     Curse on ungrateful man, that can be pleased,
     And yet can starve the author of the pleasure.
     O thou, my elder brother in misfortune,
     By far my elder brother in the Muses,
     With tears I pity thy unhappy fate!
     Why is the Bard unpitied by the world,
     Yet has so keen a relish of its pleasures?

      Epistle To Mrs. Scott
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Gudewife of Wauchope—House, Roxburghshire.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Gudewife,

     I Mind it weel in early date,
     When I was bardless, young, and blate,
     An' first could thresh the barn,
     Or haud a yokin' at the pleugh;
     An, tho' forfoughten sair eneugh,
     Yet unco proud to learn:
     When first amang the yellow corn
     A man I reckon'd was,
     An' wi' the lave ilk merry morn
     Could rank my rig and lass,
     Still shearing, and clearing
     The tither stooked raw,
     Wi' claivers, an' haivers,
     Wearing the day awa.

     E'en then, a wish, (I mind its pow'r),
     A wish that to my latest hour
     Shall strongly heave my breast,
     That I for poor auld Scotland's sake
     Some usefu' plan or book could make,
     Or sing a sang at least.
     The rough burr-thistle, spreading wide
     Amang the bearded bear,
     I turn'd the weeder-clips aside,
     An' spar'd the symbol dear:
     No nation, no station,
     My envy e'er could raise;
     A Scot still, but blot still,
     I knew nae higher praise.

     But still the elements o' sang,
     In formless jumble, right an' wrang,
     Wild floated in my brain;
     'Till on that har'st I said before,
     May partner in the merry core,
     She rous'd the forming strain;
     I see her yet, the sonsie quean,
     That lighted up my jingle,
     Her witching smile, her pawky een
     That gart my heart-strings tingle;
     I fired, inspired,
     At every kindling keek,
     But bashing, and dashing,
     I feared aye to speak.

     Health to the sex! ilk guid chiel says:
     Wi' merry dance in winter days,
     An' we to share in common;
     The gust o' joy, the balm of woe,
     The saul o' life, the heaven below,
     Is rapture-giving woman.
     Ye surly sumphs, who hate the name,
     Be mindfu' o' your mither;
     She, honest woman, may think shame
     That ye're connected with her:
     Ye're wae men, ye're nae men
     That slight the lovely dears;
     To shame ye, disclaim ye,
     Ilk honest birkie swears.

     For you, no bred to barn and byre,
     Wha sweetly tune the Scottish lyre,
     Thanks to you for your line:
     The marled plaid ye kindly spare,
     By me should gratefully be ware;
     'Twad please me to the nine.
     I'd be mair vauntie o' my hap,
     Douce hingin owre my curple,
     Than ony ermine ever lap,
     Or proud imperial purple.
     Farewell then, lang hale then,
     An' plenty be your fa;
     May losses and crosses
     Ne'er at your hallan ca'!

    <h2>
      Prologue
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Spoken by Mr. Woods on his benefit-night, Monday, 16th April, 1787.

     When, by a generous Public's kind acclaim,
     That dearest meed is granted—honest fame;
     Waen here your favour is the actor's lot,
     Nor even the man in private life forgot;
     What breast so dead to heavenly Virtue's glow,
     But heaves impassion'd with the grateful throe?

     Poor is the task to please a barb'rous throng,
     It needs no Siddons' powers in Southern's song;
     But here an ancient nation, fam'd afar,
     For genius, learning high, as great in war.
     Hail, Caledonia, name for ever dear!
     Before whose sons I'm honour'd to appear?

     [Footnote 1: The Nobleman is James, Fourteenth Earl of Glencairn.]

     Where every science, every nobler art,
     That can inform the mind or mend the heart,
     Is known; as grateful nations oft have found,
     Far as the rude barbarian marks the bound.
     Philosophy, no idle pedant dream,
     Here holds her search by heaven-taught Reason's beam;
     Here History paints with elegance and force
     The tide of Empire's fluctuating course;
     Here Douglas forms wild Shakespeare into plan,
     And Harley rouses all the God in man.
     When well-form'd taste and sparkling wit unite
     With manly lore, or female beauty bright,
     (Beauty, where faultless symmetry and grace
     Can only charm us in the second place),
     Witness my heart, how oft with panting fear,
     As on this night, I've met these judges here!
     But still the hope Experience taught to live,
     Equal to judge—you're candid to forgive.
     No hundred—headed riot here we meet,
     With decency and law beneath his feet;
     Nor Insolence assumes fair Freedom's name:
     Like Caledonians, you applaud or blame.

     O Thou, dread Power! whose empire-giving hand
     Has oft been stretch'd to shield the honour'd land!
     Strong may she glow with all her ancient fire;
     May every son be worthy of his sire;
     Firm may she rise, with generous disdain
     At Tyranny's, or direr Pleasure's chain;
     Still Self-dependent in her native shore,
     Bold may she brave grim Danger's loudest roar,
     Till Fate the curtain drop on worlds to be no more.

      The Bonie Moor-Hen
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     The heather was blooming, the meadows were mawn,
     Our lads gaed a-hunting ae day at the dawn,
     O'er moors and o'er mosses and mony a glen,
     At length they discover'd a bonie moor-hen.

     Chorus.—I rede you, beware at the hunting, young men,
     I rede you, beware at the hunting, young men;
     Take some on the wing, and some as they spring,
     But cannily steal on a bonie moor-hen.

     Sweet—brushing the dew from the brown heather bells
     Her colours betray'd her on yon mossy fells;
     Her plumage outlustr'd the pride o' the spring
     And O! as she wanton'd sae gay on the wing.
     I rede you, &amp;c.

     Auld Phoebus himself, as he peep'd o'er the hill,
     In spite at her plumage he tried his skill;
     He levell'd his rays where she bask'd on the brae—
     His rays were outshone, and but mark'd where she lay.
     I rede you,&amp;c.

     They hunted the valley, they hunted the hill,
     The best of our lads wi' the best o' their skill;
     But still as the fairest she sat in their sight,
     Then, whirr! she was over, a mile at a flight.
     I rede you, &amp;c.

     Here's a bottle and an honest friend!
     What wad ye wish for mair, man?
     Wha kens, before his life may end,
     What his share may be o' care, man?

     Then catch the moments as they fly,
     And use them as ye ought, man:
     Believe me, happiness is shy,
     And comes not aye when sought, man.

     Lines Written Under The Picture Of The Celebrated Miss Burns

     Cease, ye prudes, your envious railing,
     Lovely Burns has charms—confess:
     True it is, she had one failing,
     Had a woman ever less?

      Address To Wm. Tytler, Esq., Of Woodhouselee
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     With an Impression of the Author's Portrait.

     Revered defender of beauteous Stuart,
     Of Stuart, a name once respected;
     A name, which to love was the mark of a true heart,
     But now 'tis despis'd and neglected.

     Tho' something like moisture conglobes in my eye,
     Let no one misdeem me disloyal;
     A poor friendless wand'rer may well claim a sigh,
     Still more if that wand'rer were royal.

     My fathers that name have rever'd on a throne:
     My fathers have fallen to right it;
     Those fathers would spurn their degenerate son,
     That name should he scoffingly slight it.

     Still in prayers for King George I most heartily join,
     The Queen, and the rest of the gentry:
     Be they wise, be they foolish, is nothing of mine;
     Their title's avow'd by my country.

     But why of that epocha make such a fuss,
     That gave us th' Electoral stem?
     If bringing them over was lucky for us,
     I'm sure 'twas as lucky for them.

     But, loyalty, truce! we're on dangerous ground;
     Who knows how the fashions may alter?
     The doctrine, to-day, that is loyalty sound,
     To-morrow may bring us a halter!

     I send you a trifle, a head of a bard,
     A trifle scarce worthy your care;
     But accept it, good Sir, as a mark of regard,
     Sincere as a saint's dying prayer.

     Now life's chilly evening dim shades on your eye,
     And ushers the long dreary night:
     But you, like the star that athwart gilds the sky,
     Your course to the latest is bright.

     O Willie was a witty wight,
     And had o' things an unco' sleight,
     Auld Reekie aye he keepit tight,

     Now gawkies, tawpies, gowks and fools,

      Elegy On “Stella”
     </h2>
    <p>
      The following poem is the work of some hapless son of the Muses who
      deserved a better fate. There is a great deal of “The voice of Cona” in
      his solitary, mournful notes; and had the sentiments been clothed in
      Shenstone's language, they would have been no discredit even to that
      elegant poet.—R.B.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Strait is the spot and green the sod
     From whence my sorrows flow;
     And soundly sleeps the ever dear
     Inhabitant below.

     Pardon my transport, gentle shade,
     While o'er the turf I bow;
     Thy earthy house is circumscrib'd,
     And solitary now.

     Not one poor stone to tell thy name,
     Or make thy virtues known:
     But what avails to me—to thee,
     The sculpture of a stone?

     I'll sit me down upon this turf,
     And wipe the rising tear:
     The chill blast passes swiftly by,
     And flits around thy bier.

     Dark is the dwelling of the Dead,
     And sad their house of rest:
     Low lies the head, by Death's cold arms
     In awful fold embrac'd.

     I saw the grim Avenger stand
     Incessant by thy side;
     Unseen by thee, his deadly breath
     Thy lingering frame destroy'd.

     Pale grew the roses on thy cheek,
     And wither'd was thy bloom,
     Till the slow poison brought thy youth
     Untimely to the tomb.

     Thus wasted are the ranks of men—
     Youth, Health, and Beauty fall;
     The ruthless ruin spreads around,
     And overwhelms us all.

     Behold where, round thy narrow house,
     The graves unnumber'd lie;
     The multitude that sleep below
     Existed but to die.

     Some, with the tottering steps of Age,
     Trod down the darksome way;
     And some, in youth's lamented prime,
     Like thee were torn away:

     Yet these, however hard their fate,
     Their native earth receives;
     Amid their weeping friends they died,
     And fill their fathers' graves.

     From thy lov'd friends, when first thy heart
     Was taught by Heav'n to glow,
     Far, far remov'd, the ruthless stroke
     Surpris'd and laid thee low.

     At the last limits of our isle,
     Wash'd by the western wave,
     Touch'd by thy face, a thoughtful bard
     Sits lonely by thy grave.

     Pensive he eyes, before him spread
     The deep, outstretch'd and vast;
     His mourning notes are borne away
     Along the rapid blast.

     And while, amid the silent Dead
     Thy hapless fate he mourns,
     His own long sorrows freshly bleed,
     And all his grief returns:

     Like thee, cut off in early youth,
     And flower of beauty's pride,
     His friend, his first and only joy,
     His much lov'd Stella, died.

     Him, too, the stern impulse of Fate
     Resistless bears along;
     And the same rapid tide shall whelm
     The Poet and the Song.

     The tear of pity which he sheds,
     He asks not to receive;
     Let but his poor remains be laid
     Obscurely in the grave.

     His grief-worn heart, with truest joy,
     Shall meet he welcome shock:
     His airy harp shall lie unstrung,
     And silent on the rock.

     O, my dear maid, my Stella, when
     Shall this sick period close,
     And lead the solitary bard
     To his belov'd repose?

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Sad thy tale, thou idle page,

     Death tears the brother of her love
     From Isabella's arms.

     Sweetly deckt with pearly dew
     The morning rose may blow;
     But cold successive noontide blasts
     May lay its beauties low.

     Fair on Isabella's morn
     The sun propitious smil'd;
     But, long ere noon, succeeding clouds
     Succeeding hopes beguil'd.

     Fate oft tears the bosom chords
     That Nature finest strung;
     So Isabella's heart was form'd,
     And so that heart was wrung.

     Dread Omnipotence alone
     Can heal the wound he gave—
     Can point the brimful grief-worn eyes
     To scenes beyond the grave.

     Virtue's blossoms there shall blow,

      Elegy On The Death Of Sir James Hunter Blair
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     The lamp of day, with—ill presaging glare,
     Dim, cloudy, sank beneath the western wave;
     Th' inconstant blast howl'd thro' the dark'ning air,
     And hollow whistled in the rocky cave.

     Lone as I wander'd by each cliff and dell,
     Once the lov'd haunts of Scotia's royal train;^1
     Or mus'd where limpid streams, once hallow'd well,^2
     Or mould'ring ruins mark the sacred fane.^3

     Th' increasing blast roar'd round the beetling rocks,
     The clouds swift-wing'd flew o'er the starry sky,
     The groaning trees untimely shed their locks,
     And shooting meteors caught the startled eye.

     [Footnote 1: The King's Park at Holyrood House.—R. B.]

     [Footnote 2: St. Anthony's well.—R. B.]

     [Footnote 3: St. Anthony's Chapel.—R. B.]

     The paly moon rose in the livid east.
     And 'mong the cliffs disclos'd a stately form
     In weeds of woe, that frantic beat her breast,
     And mix'd her wailings with the raving storm

     Wild to my heart the filial pulses glow,
     'Twas Caledonia's trophied shield I view'd:
     Her form majestic droop'd in pensive woe,
     The lightning of her eye in tears imbued.

     Revers'd that spear, redoubtable in war,
     Reclined that banner, erst in fields unfurl'd,
     That like a deathful meteor gleam'd afar,
     And brav'd the mighty monarchs of the world.

     “My patriot son fills an untimely grave!”
      With accents wild and lifted arms she cried;
     “Low lies the hand oft was stretch'd to save,
     Low lies the heart that swell'd with honest pride.

     “A weeping country joins a widow's tear;
     The helpless poor mix with the orphan's cry;
     The drooping arts surround their patron's bier;
     And grateful science heaves the heartfelt sigh!

     “I saw my sons resume their ancient fire;
     I saw fair Freedom's blossoms richly blow:
     But ah! how hope is born but to expire!
     Relentless fate has laid their guardian low.

     “My patriot falls: but shall he lie unsung,
     While empty greatness saves a worthless name?
     No; every muse shall join her tuneful tongue,
     And future ages hear his growing fame.

     “And I will join a mother's tender cares,
     Thro' future times to make his virtues last;
     That distant years may boast of other Blairs!”—
     She said, and vanish'd with the sweeping blast.

      Verses Written With A Pencil

    <h3>
      Over the Chimney—piece in the Parlour of the Inn at Kenmore,
      Taymouth.
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Admiring Nature in her wildest grace,
     These northern scenes with weary feet I trace;
     O'er many a winding dale and painful steep,
     Th' abodes of covey'd grouse and timid sheep,

     [Footnote 1: These are rhymes of dubious authenticity.—Lang.]

     My savage journey, curious, I pursue,
     Till fam'd Breadalbane opens to my view.—
     The meeting cliffs each deep-sunk glen divides,
     The woods wild scatter'd, clothe their ample sides;
     Th' outstretching lake, imbosomed 'mong the hills,
     The eye with wonder and amazement fills;
     The Tay meand'ring sweet in infant pride,
     The palace rising on his verdant side,
     The lawns wood-fring'd in Nature's native taste,
     The hillocks dropt in Nature's careless haste,
     The arches striding o'er the new-born stream,
     The village glittering in the noontide beam—

     Poetic ardours in my bosom swell,
     Lone wand'ring by the hermit's mossy cell;
     The sweeping theatre of hanging woods,
     Th' incessant roar of headlong tumbling floods—

     Here Poesy might wake her heav'n-taught lyre,
     And look through Nature with creative fire;
     Here, to the wrongs of Fate half reconcil'd,
     Misfortunes lighten'd steps might wander wild;
     And Disappointment, in these lonely bounds,
     Find balm to soothe her bitter, rankling wounds:
     Here heart-struck Grief might heav'nward stretch her scan,
     And injur'd Worth forget and pardon man.

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Chorus.—Bonie lassie, will ye go,
     Will ye go, will ye go,
     Bonie lassie, will ye go
     To the birks of Aberfeldy!

     Now Simmer blinks on flowery braes,
     And o'er the crystal streamlets plays;
     Come let us spend the lightsome days,
     In the birks of Aberfeldy.
     Bonie lassie, &amp;c.

     While o'er their heads the hazels hing,

     The foaming stream deep-roaring fa's,

     The hoary cliffs are crown'd wi' flowers,
     White o'er the linns the burnie pours,
     And rising, weets wi' misty showers
     The birks of Aberfeldy.
     Bonie lassie, &amp;c.

     Let Fortune's gifts at randoe flee,
     They ne'er shall draw a wish frae me;
     Supremely blest wi' love and thee,

    <h2>
      The Humble Petition Of Bruar Water
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     To the noble Duke of Athole.

     My lord, I know your noble ear
     Woe ne'er assails in vain;
     Embolden'd thus, I beg you'll hear
     Your humble slave complain,
     How saucy Phoebus' scorching beams,
     In flaming summer-pride,
     Dry-withering, waste my foamy streams,
     And drink my crystal tide.^1

     The lightly-jumping, glowrin' trouts,
     That thro' my waters play,
     If, in their random, wanton spouts,
     They near the margin stray;

     [Footnote 1: Bruar Falls, in Athole, are exceedingly picturesque
     and beautiful; but their effect is much impaired by the want of
     trees and shrubs.—R.B.]

     If, hapless chance! they linger lang,
     I'm scorching up so shallow,
     They're left the whitening stanes amang,
     In gasping death to wallow.

     Last day I grat wi' spite and teen,
     As poet Burns came by.
     That, to a bard, I should be seen
     Wi' half my channel dry;
     A panegyric rhyme, I ween,
     Ev'n as I was, he shor'd me;
     But had I in my glory been,
     He, kneeling, wad ador'd me.

     Here, foaming down the skelvy rocks,
     In twisting strength I rin;
     There, high my boiling torrent smokes,
     Wild-roaring o'er a linn:
     Enjoying each large spring and well,
     As Nature gave them me,
     I am, altho' I say't mysel',
     Worth gaun a mile to see.

     Would then my noble master please
     To grant my highest wishes,
     He'll shade my banks wi' tow'ring trees,
     And bonie spreading bushes.
     Delighted doubly then, my lord,
     You'll wander on my banks,
     And listen mony a grateful bird
     Return you tuneful thanks.

     The sober lav'rock, warbling wild,
     Shall to the skies aspire;
     The gowdspink, Music's gayest child,
     Shall sweetly join the choir;
     The blackbird strong, the lintwhite clear,
     The mavis mild and mellow;
     The robin pensive Autumn cheer,
     In all her locks of yellow.

     This, too, a covert shall ensure,
     To shield them from the storm;
     And coward maukin sleep secure,
     Low in her grassy form:
     Here shall the shepherd make his seat,
     To weave his crown of flow'rs;
     Or find a shelt'ring, safe retreat,
     From prone-descending show'rs.

     And here, by sweet, endearing stealth,
     Shall meet the loving pair,
     Despising worlds, with all their wealth,
     As empty idle care;
     The flow'rs shall vie in all their charms,
     The hour of heav'n to grace;
     And birks extend their fragrant arms
     To screen the dear embrace.

     Here haply too, at vernal dawn,
     Some musing bard may stray,
     And eye the smoking, dewy lawn,
     And misty mountain grey;
     Or, by the reaper's nightly beam,
     Mild-chequering thro' the trees,
     Rave to my darkly dashing stream,
     Hoarse-swelling on the breeze.

     Let lofty firs, and ashes cool,
     My lowly banks o'erspread,
     And view, deep-bending in the pool,
     Their shadow's wat'ry bed:
     Let fragrant birks, in woodbines drest,
     My craggy cliffs adorn;
     And, for the little songster's nest,
     The close embow'ring thorn.

     So may old Scotia's darling hope,
     Your little angel band
     Spring, like their fathers, up to prop
     Their honour'd native land!
     So may, thro' Albion's farthest ken,
     To social-flowing glasses,
     The grace be—“Athole's honest men,
     And Athole's bonie lasses!

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Written with a Pencil on the Spot.

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Among the heathy hills and ragged woods
     The roaring Fyers pours his mossy floods;
     Till full he dashes on the rocky mounds,
     Where, thro' a shapeless breach, his stream resounds.
     As high in air the bursting torrents flow,
     As deep recoiling surges foam below,
     Prone down the rock the whitening sheet descends,
     And viewles Echo's ear, astonished, rends.
     Dim-seen, through rising mists and ceaseless show'rs,
     The hoary cavern, wide surrounding lours:
     Still thro' the gap the struggling river toils,
     And still, below, the horrid cauldron boils—

      Strathallan's Lament^1
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Thickest night, o'erhang my dwelling!
     Howling tempests, o'er me rave!
     Turbid torrents, wintry swelling,
     Roaring by my lonely cave!

     [Footnote 1: Burns confesses that his Jacobtism was merely
     sentimental “except when my passions were heated by some
     accidental cause,” and a tour through the country where Montrose,
     Claverhouse, and Prince Charles had fought, was cause enough.
     Strathallan fell gloriously at Culloden.—Lang.]

     Crystal streamlets gently flowing,
     Busy haunts of base mankind,
     Western breezes softly blowing,
     Suit not my distracted mind.

     In the cause of Right engaged,
     Wrongs injurious to redress,
     Honour's war we strongly waged,
     But the Heavens denied success.
     Ruin's wheel has driven o'er us,
     Not a hope that dare attend,
     The wide world is all before us—
     But a world without a friend.

     Never bound by Winter's chains;
     Glowing here on golden sands,
     There immix'd with foulest stains
     From Tyranny's empurpled hands;
     These, their richly gleaming waves,
     I leave to tyrants and their slaves;
     Give me the stream that sweetly laves
     The banks by Castle Gordon.

     Spicy forests, ever gray,
     Shading from the burning ray
     Hapless wretches sold to toil;
     Or the ruthless native's way,
     Bent on slaughter, blood, and spoil:
     Woods that ever verdant wave,
     I leave the tyrant and the slave;
     Give me the groves that lofty brave
     The storms by Castle Gordon.

     Wildly here, without control,
     Nature reigns and rules the whole;
     In that sober pensive mood,
     Dearest to the feeling soul,
     She plants the forest, pours the flood:
     Life's poor day I'll musing rave
     And find at night a sheltering cave,
     Where waters flow and wild woods wave,
     By bonie Castle Gordon.

      On Scaring Some Water-Fowl In Loch-Turit
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     A wild scene among the Hills of Oughtertyre.
</pre>
    <p>
      “This was the production of a solitary forenoon's walk from Oughtertyre
      House. I lived there, the guest of Sir William Murray, for two or three
      weeks, and was much flattered by my hospitable reception. What a pity that
      the mere emotions of gratitude are so impotent in this world. 'Tis lucky
      that, as we are told, they will be of some avail in the world to come.”
       —R.B., Glenriddell MSS.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Why, ye tenants of the lake,
     For me your wat'ry haunt forsake?
     Tell me, fellow-creatures, why
     At my presence thus you fly?
     Why disturb your social joys,
     Parent, filial, kindred ties?—
     Common friend to you and me,
     yature's gifts to all are free:
     Peaceful keep your dimpling wave,
     Busy feed, or wanton lave;
     Or, beneath the sheltering rock,
     Bide the surging billow's shock.

     Conscious, blushing for our race,
     Soon, too soon, your fears I trace,
     Man, your proud, usurping foe,
     Would be lord of all below:
     Plumes himself in freedom's pride,
     Tyrant stern to all beside.

     The eagle, from the cliffy brow,
     Marking you his prey below,
     In his breast no pity dwells,
     Strong necessity compels:
     But Man, to whom alone is giv'n
     A ray direct from pitying Heav'n,
     Glories in his heart humane—
     And creatures for his pleasure slain!

     In these savage, liquid plains,
     Only known to wand'ring swains,
     Where the mossy riv'let strays,
     Far from human haunts and ways;
     All on Nature you depend,
     And life's poor season peaceful spend.

     Or, if man's superior might
     Dare invade your native right,
     On the lofty ether borne,
     Man with all his pow'rs you scorn;
     Swiftly seek, on clanging wings,
     Other lakes and other springs;
     And the foe you cannot brave,
     Scorn at least to be his slave.

     In the gay rosy morn, as it bathes in the dew;
     And gentle the fall of the soft vernal shower,
     That steals on the evening each leaf to renew!

     O spare the dear blossom, ye orient breezes,
     With chill hoary wing as ye usher the dawn;
     And far be thou distant, thou reptile that seizes
     The verdure and pride of the garden or lawn!
     Let Bourbon exult in his gay gilded lilies,
     And England triumphant display her proud rose:
     A fairer than either adorns the green valleys,
     Where Devon, sweet Devon, meandering flows.

     Astonish'd, doubly marks it beam
     With art's most polish'd blaze.

      Birthday Ode For 31st December, 1787^1
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Afar the illustrious Exile roams,
     Whom kingdoms on this day should hail;
     An inmate in the casual shed,
     On transient pity's bounty fed,
     Haunted by busy memory's bitter tale!
     Beasts of the forest have their savage homes,
     But He, who should imperial purple wear,
     Owns not the lap of earth where rests his royal head!
     His wretched refuge, dark despair,
     While ravening wrongs and woes pursue,
     And distant far the faithful few
     Who would his sorrows share.

     False flatterer, Hope, away!
     Nor think to lure us as in days of yore:
     We solemnize this sorrowing natal day,
     To prove our loyal truth—we can no more,
     And owning Heaven's mysterious sway,
     Submissive, low adore.

     Ye honored, mighty Dead,
     Who nobly perished in the glorious cause,
     Your King, your Country, and her laws,

     [Footnote 1: The last birthday of Prince Charles Edward.]

     From great Dundee, who smiling Victory led,
     And fell a Martyr in her arms,
     (What breast of northern ice but warms!)
     To bold Balmerino's undying name,
     Whose soul of fire, lighted at Heaven's high flame,
     Deserves the proudest wreath departed heroes claim:
     Nor unrevenged your fate shall lie,
     It only lags, the fatal hour,
     Your blood shall, with incessant cry,
     Awake at last, th' unsparing Power;
     As from the cliff, with thundering course,
     The snowy ruin smokes along
     With doubling speed and gathering force,
     Till deep it, crushing, whelms the cottage in the vale;
     So Vengeance' arm, ensanguin'd, strong,
     Shall with resistless might assail,
     Usurping Brunswick's pride shall lay,
     And Stewart's wrongs and yours, with tenfold weight repay.

     Perdition, baleful child of night!
     Rise and revenge the injured right
     Of Stewart's royal race:
     Lead on the unmuzzled hounds of hell,
     Till all the frighted echoes tell
     The blood-notes of the chase!
     Full on the quarry point their view,
     Full on the base usurping crew,
     The tools of faction, and the nation's curse!
     Hark how the cry grows on the wind;
     They leave the lagging gale behind,
     Their savage fury, pitiless, they pour;
     With murdering eyes already they devour;
     See Brunswick spent, a wretched prey,
     His life one poor despairing day,
     Where each avenging hour still ushers in a worse!
     Such havock, howling all abroad,
     Their utter ruin bring,
     The base apostates to their God,
     Or rebels to their King.

    <h2>
      On The Death Of Robert Dundas, Esq., Of Arniston,
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Late Lord President of the Court of Session.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Lone on the bleaky hills the straying flocks
     Shun the fierce storms among the sheltering rocks;
     Down from the rivulets, red with dashing rains,
     The gathering floods burst o'er the distant plains;
     Beneath the blast the leafless forests groan;
     The hollow caves return a hollow moan.
     Ye hills, ye plains, ye forests, and ye caves,
     Ye howling winds, and wintry swelling waves!
     Unheard, unseen, by human ear or eye,
     Sad to your sympathetic glooms I fly;
     Where, to the whistling blast and water's roar,
     Pale Scotia's recent wound I may deplore.

     O heavy loss, thy country ill could bear!
     A loss these evil days can ne'er repair!
     Justice, the high vicegerent of her God,
     Her doubtful balance eyed, and sway'd her rod:
     Hearing the tidings of the fatal blow,
     She sank, abandon'd to the wildest woe.

     Wrongs, injuries, from many a darksome den,
     Now, gay in hope, explore the paths of men:
     See from his cavern grim Oppression rise,
     And throw on Poverty his cruel eyes;
     Keen on the helpless victim see him fly,
     And stifle, dark, the feebly-bursting cry:
     Mark Ruffian Violence, distained with crimes,
     Rousing elate in these degenerate times,
     View unsuspecting Innocence a prey,
     As guileful Fraud points out the erring way:
     While subtle Litigation's pliant tongue
     The life-blood equal sucks of Right and Wrong:
     Hark, injur'd Want recounts th' unlisten'd tale,
     And much-wrong'd Mis'ry pours the unpitied wail!

     Ye dark waste hills, ye brown unsightly plains,
     Congenial scenes, ye soothe my mournful strains:
     Ye tempests, rage! ye turbid torrents, roll!
     Ye suit the joyless tenor of my soul.
     Life's social haunts and pleasures I resign;
     Be nameless wilds and lonely wanderings mine,
     To mourn the woes my country must endure—
     That would degenerate ages cannot cure.

      Sylvander To Clarinda^1
    </h2>
    <p>
      Extempore Reply to Verses addressed to the Author by a Lady, under the
      signature of “Clarinda” and entitled, On Burns saying he 'had nothing else
      to do.'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     When dear Clarinda, matchless fair,
     First struck Sylvander's raptur'd view,
     He gaz'd, he listened to despair,
     Alas! 'twas all he dared to do.

     Love, from Clarinda's heavenly eyes,
     Transfixed his bosom thro' and thro';
     But still in Friendships' guarded guise,
     For more the demon fear'd to do.

     That heart, already more than lost,
     The imp beleaguer'd all perdue;
     For frowning Honour kept his post—
     To meet that frown, he shrunk to do.

     His pangs the Bard refused to own,
     Tho' half he wish'd Clarinda knew;
     But Anguish wrung the unweeting groan—
     Who blames what frantic Pain must do?

     That heart, where motley follies blend,
     Was sternly still to Honour true:
     To prove Clarinda's fondest friend,
     Was what a lover sure might do.

     [Footnote 1: A grass-widow, Mrs. M'Lehose.]

     The Muse his ready quill employed,
     No nearer bliss he could pursue;
     That bliss Clarinda cold deny'd—
     “Send word by Charles how you do!”

     The chill behest disarm'd his muse,
     Till passion all impatient grew:
     He wrote, and hinted for excuse,
     'Twas, 'cause “he'd nothing else to do.”

     But by those hopes I have above!
     And by those faults I dearly rue!
     The deed, the boldest mark of love,
     For thee that deed I dare uo do!

     O could the Fates but name the price
     Would bless me with your charms and you!
     With frantic joy I'd pay it thrice,
     If human art and power could do!

     Then take, Clarinda, friendship's hand,
     (Friendship, at least, I may avow;)
     And lay no more your chill command,—
     I'll write whatever I've to do.

     The murmuring streamlet winds clear thro' the vale;
     The primroses blow in the dews of the morning,
     And wild scatter'd cowslips bedeck the green dale:
     But what can give pleasure, or what can seem fair,
     When the lingering moments are numbered by care?
     No birds sweetly singing, nor flow'rs gaily springing,
     Can soothe the sad bosom of joyless despair.

     The deed that I dared, could it merit their malice?
     A king and a father to place on his throne!
     His right are these hills, and his right are these valleys,
     Where the wild beasts find shelter, tho' I can find none!
     But 'tis not my suff'rings, thus wretched, forlorn,
     My brave gallant friends, 'tis your ruin I mourn;

      Epistle To Hugh Parker
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     In this strange land, this uncouth clime,
     A land unknown to prose or rhyme;
     Where words ne'er cross't the Muse's heckles,
     Nor limpit in poetic shackles:
     A land that Prose did never view it,
     Except when drunk he stacher't thro' it;
     Here, ambush'd by the chimla cheek,
     Hid in an atmosphere of reek,
     I hear a wheel thrum i' the neuk,
     I hear it—for in vain I leuk.
     The red peat gleams, a fiery kernel,
     Enhusked by a fog infernal:
     Here, for my wonted rhyming raptures,
     I sit and count my sins by chapters;
     For life and spunk like ither Christians,
     I'm dwindled down to mere existence,
     Wi' nae converse but Gallowa' bodies,
     Wi' nae kenn'd face but Jenny Geddes,
     Jenny, my Pegasean pride!
     Dowie she saunters down Nithside,
     And aye a westlin leuk she throws,
     While tears hap o'er her auld brown nose!
     Was it for this, wi' cannie care,
     Thou bure the Bard through many a shire?
     At howes, or hillocks never stumbled,
     And late or early never grumbled?—
     O had I power like inclination,
     I'd heeze thee up a constellation,
     To canter with the Sagitarre,
     Or loup the ecliptic like a bar;
     Or turn the pole like any arrow;
     Or, when auld Phoebus bids good-morrow,
     Down the zodiac urge the race,
     And cast dirt on his godship's face;
     For I could lay my bread and kail
     He'd ne'er cast saut upo' thy tail.—
     Wi' a' this care and a' this grief,
     And sma', sma' prospect of relief,
     And nought but peat reek i' my head,
     How can I write what ye can read?—
     Tarbolton, twenty-fourth o' June,
     Ye'll find me in a better tune;
     But till we meet and weet our whistle,
     Tak this excuse for nae epistle.

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Glenriddel Hermitage, June 28th, 1788.

     Thou whom chance may hither lead,
     Be thou clad in russet weed,
     Be thou deckt in silken stole,
     Grave these maxims on thy soul.

     Life is but a day at most,
     Sprung from night, in darkness lost:
     Hope not sunshine every hour,
     Fear not clouds will always lour.

     Happiness is but a name,
     Make content and ease thy aim,
     Ambition is a meteor-gleam;
     Fame, an idle restless dream;

     Peace, the tend'rest flow'r of spring;
     Pleasures, insects on the wing;
     Those that sip the dew alone—
     Make the butterflies thy own;
     Those that would the bloom devour—
     Crush the locusts, save the flower.

     For the future be prepar'd,
     Guard wherever thou can'st guard;
     But thy utmost duly done,
     Welcome what thou can'st not shun.
     Follies past, give thou to air,
     Make their consequence thy care:
     Keep the name of Man in mind,
     And dishonour not thy kind.
     Reverence with lowly heart
     Him, whose wondrous work thou art;
     Keep His Goodness still in view,
     Thy trust, and thy example, too.

     Stranger, go! Heaven be thy guide!
     Quod the Beadsman of Nidside.

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Ellisland, Nithsdale, July 27th, 1788.

     My godlike friend—nay, do not stare,
     You think the phrase is odd-like;
     But God is love, the saints declare,
     Then surely thou art god-like.

     And is thy ardour still the same?
     And kindled still at Anna?
     Others may boast a partial flame,
     But thou art a volcano!

     Ev'n Wedlock asks not love beyond
     Death's tie-dissolving portal;
     But thou, omnipotently fond,
     May'st promise love immortal!

     Thy wounds such healing powers defy,
     Such symptoms dire attend them,
     That last great antihectic try—
     Marriage perhaps may mend them.

     Sweet Anna has an air—a grace,
     Divine, magnetic, touching:
     She talks, she charms—but who can trace
     The process of bewitching?

     The western breeze steals thro'the trees,
     To view this Fete Champetre.

     What sparkling jewels glance, man!
     To Harmony's enchanting notes,

     The echoing wood, the winding flood,
     Like Paradise did glitter,

     To hold their Fete Champetre.

     And make his ether-stane, man!
     He circled round the magic ground,
     But entrance found he nane, man:
     He blush'd for shame, he quat his name,
     Forswore it, every letter,
     Wi' humble prayer to join and share
     This festive Fete Champetre.

    <h2>
      Epistle To Robert Graham, Esq., Of Fintry
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Requesting a Favour

     When Nature her great master-piece design'd,
     And fram'd her last, best work, the human mind,
     Her eye intent on all the mazy plan,
     She form'd of various parts the various Man.

     Then first she calls the useful many forth;
     Plain plodding Industry, and sober Worth:
     Thence peasants, farmers, native sons of earth,
     And merchandise' whole genus take their birth:
     Each prudent cit a warm existence finds,
     And all mechanics' many-apron'd kinds.
     Some other rarer sorts are wanted yet,
     The lead and buoy are needful to the net:
     The caput mortuum of grnss desires
     Makes a material for mere knights and squires;
     The martial phosphorus is taught to flow,
     She kneads the lumpish philosophic dough,
     Then marks th' unyielding mass with grave designs,
     Law, physic, politics, and deep divines;
     Last, she sublimes th' Aurora of the poles,
     The flashing elements of female souls.

     The order'd system fair before her stood,
     Nature, well pleas'd, pronounc'd it very good;
     But ere she gave creating labour o'er,
     Half-jest, she tried one curious labour more.
     Some spumy, fiery, ignis fatuus matter,
     Such as the slightest breath of air might scatter;
     With arch-alacrity and conscious glee,
     (Nature may have her whim as well as we,
     Her Hogarth-art perhaps she meant to show it),
     She forms the thing and christens it—a Poet:
     Creature, tho' oft the prey of care and sorrow,
     When blest to-day, unmindful of to-morrow;
     A being form'd t' amuse his graver friends,
     Admir'd and prais'd—and there the homage ends;
     A mortal quite unfit for Fortune's strife,
     Yet oft the sport of all the ills of life;
     Prone to enjoy each pleasure riches give,
     Yet haply wanting wherewithal to live;
     Longing to wipe each tear, to heal each groan,
     Yet frequent all unheeded in his own.

     But honest Nature is not quite a Turk,
     She laugh'd at first, then felt for her poor work:
     Pitying the propless climber of mankind,
     She cast about a standard tree to find;
     And, to support his helpless woodbine state,
     Attach'd him to the generous, truly great:
     A title, and the only one I claim,
     To lay strong hold for help on bounteous Graham.

     Pity the tuneful Muses' hapless train,
     Weak, timid landsmen on life's stormy main!
     Their hearts no selfish stern absorbent stuff,
     That never gives—tho' humbly takes enough;
     The little fate allows, they share as soon,
     Unlike sage proverb'd Wisdom's hard-wrung boon:
     The world were blest did bliss on them depend,
     Ah, that “the friendly e'er should want a friend!”
      Let Prudence number o'er each sturdy son,
     Who life and wisdom at one race begun,
     Who feel by reason and who give by rule,
     (Instinct's a brute, and sentiment a fool!)
     Who make poor “will do” wait upon “I should”—
     We own they're prudent, but who feels they're good?
     Ye wise ones hence! ye hurt the social eye!
     God's image rudely etch'd on base alloy!
     But come ye who the godlike pleasure know,
     Heaven's attribute distinguished—to bestow!
     Whose arms of love would grasp the human race:
     Come thou who giv'st with all a courtier's grace;
     Friend of my life, true patron of my rhymes!
     Prop of my dearest hopes for future times.
     Why shrinks my soul half blushing, half afraid,
     Backward, abash'd to ask thy friendly aid?
     I know my need, I know thy giving hand,
     I crave thy friendship at thy kind command;
     But there are such who court the tuneful Nine—
     Heavens! should the branded character be mine!
     Whose verse in manhood's pride sublimely flows,
     Yet vilest reptiles in their begging prose.
     Mark, how their lofty independent spirit
     Soars on the spurning wing of injured merit!
     Seek not the proofs in private life to find
     Pity the best of words should be but wind!
     So, to heaven's gates the lark's shrill song ascends,
     But grovelling on the earth the carol ends.
     In all the clam'rous cry of starving want,
     They dun Benevolence with shameless front;
     Oblige them, patronise their tinsel lays—
     They persecute you all your future days!
     Ere my poor soul such deep damnation stain,
     My horny fist assume the plough again,
     The pie-bald jacket let me patch once more,
     On eighteenpence a week I've liv'd before.
     Tho', thanks to Heaven, I dare even that last shift,
     I trust, meantime, my boon is in thy gift:
     That, plac'd by thee upon the wish'd-for height,
     Where, man and nature fairer in her sight,
     My Muse may imp her wing for some sublimer flight.

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Tune—“Seventh of November.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     The day returns, my bosom burns,
     The blissful day we twa did meet:
     Tho' winter wild in tempest toil'd,
     Ne'er summer-sun was half sae sweet.
     Than a' the pride that loads the tide,
     And crosses o'er the sultry line;
     Than kingly robes, than crowns and globes,
     Heav'n gave me more—it made thee mine!

     While day and night can bring delight,
     Or Nature aught of pleasure give;
     While joys above my mind can move,
     For thee, and thee alone, I live.
     When that grim foe of life below
     Comes in between to make us part,
     The iron hand that breaks our band,
     It breaks my bliss—it breaks my heart!

<pre xml:space="preserve">     For the Death of Her Son.

     Fate gave the word, the arrow sped,
     And pierc'd my darling's heart;
     And with him all the joys are fled
     Life can to me impart.

     By cruel hands the sapling drops,
     In dust dishonour'd laid;
     So fell the pride of all my hopes,
     My age's future shade.

     The mother-linnet in the brake
     Bewails her ravish'd young;
     So I, for my lost darling's sake,
     Lament the live-day long.

     Death, oft I've feared thy fatal blow.

     O, do thou kindly lay me low
     With him I love, at rest!

     As Autumn to Winter resigns the pale year.

     The forests are leafless, the meadows are brown,
     And all the gay foppery of summer is flown:
     Apart let me wander, apart let me muse,
     How quick Time is flying, how keen Fate pursues!

     How long I have liv'd—but how much liv'd in vain,
     How little of life's scanty span may remain,
     What aspects old Time in his progress has worn,
     What ties cruel Fate, in my bosom has torn.

     How foolish, or worse, till our summit is gain'd!
     And downward, how weaken'd, how darken'd, how pain'd!
     Life is not worth having with all it can give—

      Written In Friar's-Carse Hermitage
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     On Nithside

     Thou whom chance may hither lead,
     Be thou clad in russet weed,
     Be thou deckt in silken stole,
     Grave these counsels on thy soul.

     Life is but a day at most,
     Sprung from night,—in darkness lost;
     Hope not sunshine ev'ry hour,
     Fear not clouds will always lour.

     As Youth and Love with sprightly dance,
     Beneath thy morning star advance,
     Pleasure with her siren air
     May delude the thoughtless pair;
     Let Prudence bless Enjoyment's cup,
     Then raptur'd sip, and sip it up.

     As thy day grows warm and high,
     Life's meridian flaming nigh,
     Dost thou spurn the humble vale?
     Life's proud summits wouldst thou scale?
     Check thy climbing step, elate,
     Evils lurk in felon wait:
     Dangers, eagle-pinioned, bold,
     Soar around each cliffy hold!
     While cheerful Peace, with linnet song,
     Chants the lowly dells among.

     As the shades of ev'ning close,
     Beck'ning thee to long repose;
     As life itself becomes disease,
     Seek the chimney-nook of ease;
     There ruminate with sober thought,
     On all thou'st seen, and heard, and wrought,
     And teach the sportive younkers round,
     Saws of experience, sage and sound:
     Say, man's true, genuine estimate,
     The grand criterion of his fate,
     Is not,—Arth thou high or low?
     Did thy fortune ebb or flow?
     Did many talents gild thy span?
     Or frugal Nature grudge thee one?
     Tell them, and press it on their mind,
     As thou thyself must shortly find,
     The smile or frown of awful Heav'n,
     To virtue or to Vice is giv'n,
     Say, to be just, and kind, and wise—
     There solid self-enjoyment lies;
     That foolish, selfish, faithless ways
     Lead to be wretched, vile, and base.

     Thus resign'd and quiet, creep
     To the bed of lasting sleep,—
     Sleep, whence thou shalt ne'er awake,
     Night, where dawn shall never break,
     Till future life, future no more,
     To light and joy the good restore,
     To light and joy unknown before.
     Stranger, go! Heav'n be thy guide!
     Quod the Beadsman of Nithside.

      The Poet's Progress
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     A Poem In Embryo

     Thou, Nature, partial Nature, I arraign;
     Of thy caprice maternal I complain.

     The peopled fold thy kindly care have found,
     The horned bull, tremendous, spurns the ground;
     The lordly lion has enough and more,
     The forest trembles at his very roar;
     Thou giv'st the ass his hide, the snail his shell,
     The puny wasp, victorious, guards his cell.
     Thy minions, kings defend, controul devour,
     In all th' omnipotence of rule and power:
     Foxes and statesmen subtle wiles ensure;
     The cit and polecat stink, and are secure:
     Toads with their poison, doctors with their drug,
     The priest and hedgehog, in their robes, are snug:
     E'en silly women have defensive arts,
     Their eyes, their tongues—and nameless other parts.

     But O thou cruel stepmother and hard,
     To thy poor fenceless, naked child, the Bard!
     A thing unteachable in worldly skill,
     And half an idiot too, more helpless still:
     No heels to bear him from the op'ning dun,
     No claws to dig, his hated sight to shun:
     No horns, but those by luckless Hymen worn,
     And those, alas! not Amalthea's horn:
     No nerves olfact'ry, true to Mammon's foot,
     Or grunting, grub sagacious, evil's root:
     The silly sheep that wanders wild astray,
     Is not more friendless, is not more a prey;
     Vampyre—booksellers drain him to the heart,
     And viper—critics cureless venom dart.

     Critics! appll'd I venture on the name,
     Those cut-throat bandits in the paths of fame,
     Bloody dissectors, worse than ten Monroes,
     He hacks to teach, they mangle to expose:
     By blockhead's daring into madness stung,
     His heart by wanton, causeless malice wrung,
     His well-won ways—than life itself more dear—
     By miscreants torn who ne'er one sprig must wear;
     Foil'd, bleeding, tortur'd in th' unequal strife,
     The hapless Poet flounces on through life,
     Till, fled each hope that once his bosom fired,
     And fled each Muse that glorious once inspir'd,
     Low-sunk in squalid, unprotected age,
     Dead even resentment for his injur'd page,
     He heeds no more the ruthless critics' rage.

     So by some hedge the generous steed deceas'd,
     For half-starv'd, snarling curs a dainty feast;
     By toil and famine worn to skin and bone,
     Lies, senseless of each tugging bitch's son.

     A little upright, pert, tart, tripping wight,
     And still his precious self his dear delight;
     Who loves his own smart shadow in the streets,
     Better than e'er the fairest she he meets;
     Much specious lore, but little understood,
     (Veneering oft outshines the solid wood),
     His solid sense, by inches you must tell,
     But mete his cunning by the Scottish ell!
     A man of fashion too, he made his tour,
     Learn'd “vive la bagatelle et vive l'amour;”
      So travell'd monkeys their grimace improve,
     Polish their grin—nay, sigh for ladies' love!
     His meddling vanity, a busy fiend,
     Still making work his selfish craft must mend.

     * * * Crochallan came,
     The old cock'd hat, the brown surtout—the same;
     His grisly beard just bristling in its might—
     'Twas four long nights and days from shaving-night;
     His uncomb'd, hoary locks, wild-staring, thatch'd
     A head, for thought profound and clear, unmatch'd;
     Yet, tho' his caustic wit was biting-rude,
     His heart was warm, benevolent and good.

     O Dulness, portion of the truly blest!
     Calm, shelter'd haven of eternal rest!
     Thy sons ne'er madden in the fierce extremes
     Of Fortune's polar frost, or torrid beams;
     If mantling high she fills the golden cup,
     With sober, selfish ease they sip it up;
     Conscious the bounteous meed they well deserve,
     They only wonder “some folks” do not starve!
     The grave, sage hern thus easy picks his frog,
     And thinks the mallard a sad worthless dog.
     When disappointment snaps the thread of Hope,
     When, thro' disastrous night, they darkling grope,
     With deaf endurance sluggishly they bear,
     And just conclude that “fools are Fortune's care:”
      So, heavy, passive to the tempest's shocks,
     Strong on the sign-post stands the stupid ox.

     Not so the idle Muses' mad-cap train,
     Not such the workings of their moon-struck brain;
     In equanimity they never dwell,
     By turns in soaring heaven, or vaulted hell!

      Elegy On The Year 1788
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     For lords or kings I dinna mourn,
     E'en let them die—for that they're born:
     But oh! prodigious to reflec'!
     A Towmont, sirs, is gane to wreck!
     O Eighty-eight, in thy sma' space,
     What dire events hae taken place!
     Of what enjoyments thou hast reft us!
     In what a pickle thou has left us!

     The Spanish empire's tint a head,
     And my auld teethless, Bawtie's dead:
     The tulyie's teugh 'tween Pitt and Fox,
     And 'tween our Maggie's twa wee cocks;
     The tane is game, a bluidy devil,
     But to the hen-birds unco civil;
     The tither's something dour o' treadin,
     But better stuff ne'er claw'd a middin.

     Ye ministers, come mount the poupit,
     An' cry till ye be hearse an' roupit,
     For Eighty-eight, he wished you weel,
     An' gied ye a' baith gear an' meal;
     E'en monc a plack, and mony a peck,
     Ye ken yoursels, for little feck!

     Ye bonie lasses, dight your e'en,
     For some o' you hae tint a frien';
     In Eighty-eight, ye ken, was taen,
     What ye'll ne'er hae to gie again.

     Observe the very nowt an' sheep,
     How dowff an' daviely they creep;
     Nay, even the yirth itsel' does cry,
     For E'nburgh wells are grutten dry.

     O Eighty-nine, thou's but a bairn,
     An' no owre auld, I hope, to learn!
     Thou beardless boy, I pray tak care,
     Thou now hast got thy Daddy's chair;
     Nae handcuff'd, mizl'd, hap-shackl'd Regent,
     But, like himsel, a full free agent,
     Be sure ye follow out the plan
     Nae waur than he did, honest man!
     As muckle better as you can.

     January, 1, 1789.

     Aught of Humanity's sweet, melting grace?
     Note that eye, 'tis rheum o'erflows;
     Pity's flood there never rose,
     See these hands ne'er stretched to save,
     Hands that took, but never gave:
     Keeper of Mammon's iron chest,

      Sappho Redivivus—A Fragment
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     By all I lov'd, neglected and forgot,
     No friendly face e'er lights my squalid cot;
     Shunn'd, hated, wrong'd, unpitied, unredrest,
     The mock'd quotation of the scorner's jest!
     Ev'n the poor support of my wretched life,
     Snatched by the violence of legal strife.
     Oft grateful for my very daily bread
     To those my family's once large bounty fed;
     A welcome inmate at their homely fare,
     My griefs, my woes, my sighs, my tears they share:
     (Their vulgar souls unlike the souls refin'd,
     The fashioned marble of the polished mind).

     In vain would Prudence, with decorous sneer,
     Point out a censuring world, and bid me fear;
     Above the world, on wings of Love, I rise—
     I know its worst, and can that worst despise;
     Let Prudence' direst bodements on me fall,
     M[ontgomer]y, rich reward, o'erpays them all!

     Mild zephyrs waft thee to life's farthest shore,
     Nor think of me and my distress more,—
     Falsehood accurst! No! still I beg a place,
     Still near thy heart some little, little trace:
     For that dear trace the world I would resign:
     O let me live, and die, and think it mine!

     “I burn, I burn, as when thro' ripen'd corn
     By driving winds the crackling flames are borne;”
      Now raving-wild, I curse that fatal night,
     Then bless the hour that charm'd my guilty sight:
     In vain the laws their feeble force oppose,
     Chain'd at Love's feet, they groan, his vanquish'd foes.
     In vain Religion meets my shrinking eye,
     I dare not combat, but I turn and fly:
     Conscience in vain upbraids th' unhallow'd fire,
     Love grasps her scorpions—stifled they expire!
     Reason drops headlong from his sacred throne,

     Your dear idea reigns, and reigns alone;
     Each thought intoxicated homage yields,
     And riots wanton in forbidden fields.
     By all on high adoring mortals know!
     By all the conscious villain fears below!
     By your dear self!—the last great oath I swear,
     Not life, nor soul, were ever half so dear!

     Your News and Review, sir.

      Caledonia—A Ballad
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Tune—“Caledonian Hunts' Delight” of Mr. Gow.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     There was once a day, but old Time wasythen young,
     That brave Caledonia, the chief of her line,
     From some of your northern deities sprung,
     (Who knows not that brave Caledonia's divine?)
     From Tweed to the Orcades was her domain,
     To hunt, or to pasture, or do what she would:
     Her heav'nly relations there fixed her reign,
     And pledg'd her their godheads to warrant it good.

     A lambkin in peace, but a lion in war,
     The pride of her kindred, the heroine grew:
     Her grandsire, old Odin, triumphantly swore,—
     “Whoe'er shall provoke thee, th' encounter shall rue!”
      With tillage or pasture at times she would sport,
     To feed her fair flocks by her green rustling corn;
     But chiefly the woods were her fav'rite resort,
     Her darling amusement, the hounds and the horn.

     Long quiet she reigned; till thitherward steers
     A flight of bold eagles from Adria's strand:
     Repeated, successive, for many long years,
     They darken'd the air, and they plunder'd the land:
     Their pounces were murder, and terror their cry,
     They'd conquer'd and ruin'd a world beside;
     She took to her hills, and her arrows let fly,
     The daring invaders they fled or they died.

     The Cameleon-Savage disturb'd her repose,
     With tumult, disquiet, rebellion, and strife;
     Provok'd beyond bearing, at last she arose,
     And robb'd him at once of his hopes and his life:
     The Anglian lion, the terror of France,
     Oft prowling, ensanguin'd the Tweed's silver flood;
     But, taught by the bright Caledonian lance,
     He learned to fear in his own native wood.

     The fell Harpy-raven took wing from the north,
     The scourge of the seas, and the dread of the shore;
     The wild Scandinavian boar issued forth
     To wanton in carnage and wallow in gore:
     O'er countries and kingdoms their fury prevail'd,
     No arts could appease them, no arms could repel;
     But brave Caledonia in vain they assail'd,
     As Largs well can witness, and Loncartie tell.

     Thus bold, independent, unconquer'd, and free,
     Her bright course of glory for ever shall run:
     For brave Caledonia immortal must be;
     I'll prove it from Euclid as clear as the sun:
     Rectangle—triangle, the figure we'll chuse:
     The upright is Chance, and old Time is the base;
     But brave Caledonia's the hypothenuse;
     Then, ergo, she'll match them, and match them always.

      Ode On The Departed Regency Bill
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     (March, 1789)

     Daughter of Chaos' doting years,
     Nurse of ten thousand hopes and fears,
     Whether thy airy, insubstantial shade
     (The rights of sepulture now duly paid)
     Spread abroad its hideous form
     On the roaring civil storm,
     Deafening din and warring rage
     Factions wild with factions wage;
     Or under-ground, deep-sunk, profound,
     Among the demons of the earth,
     With groans that make the mountains shake,
     Thou mourn thy ill-starr'd, blighted birth;
     Or in the uncreated Void,
     Where seeds of future being fight,
     With lessen'd step thou wander wide,
     To greet thy Mother—Ancient Night.
     And as each jarring, monster-mass is past,
     Fond recollect what once thou wast:
     In manner due, beneath this sacred oak,
     Hear, Spirit, hear! thy presence I invoke!
     By a Monarch's heaven-struck fate,
     By a disunited State,
     By a generous Prince's wrongs.
     By a Senate's strife of tongues,
     By a Premier's sullen pride,
     Louring on the changing tide;
     By dread Thurlow's powers to awe
     Rhetoric, blasphemy and law;
     By the turbulent ocean—
     A Nation's commotion,
     By the harlot-caresses
     Of borough addresses,
     By days few and evil,
     (Thy portion, poor devil!)
     By Power, Wealth, and Show,
     (The Gods by men adored,)
     By nameless Poverty,
     (Their hell abhorred,)
     By all they hope, by all they fear,
     Hear! and appear!

     Stare not on me, thou ghastly Power!
     Nor, grim with chained defiance, lour:
     No Babel-structure would I build
     Where, order exil'd from his native sway,
     Confusion may the regent-sceptre wield,
     While all would rule and none obey:
     Go, to the world of man relate
     The story of thy sad, eventful fate;
     And call presumptuous Hope to hear
     And bid him check his blind career;
     And tell the sore-prest sons of Care,
     Never, never to despair!
     Paint Charles' speed on wings of fire,
     The object of his fond desire,
     Beyond his boldest hopes, at hand:
     Paint all the triumph of the Portland Band;
     Hark how they lift the joy-elated voice!
     And who are these that equally rejoice?
     Jews, Gentiles, what a motley crew!
     The iron tears their flinty cheeks bedew;
     See how unfurled the parchment ensigns fly,
     And Principal and Interest all the cry!
     And how their num'rous creditors rejoice;
     But just as hopes to warm enjoyment rise,
     Cry Convalescence! and the vision flies.
     Then next pourtray a dark'ning twilight gloom,
     Eclipsing sad a gay, rejoicing morn,
     While proud Ambition to th' untimely tomb
     By gnashing, grim, despairing fiends is borne:
     Paint ruin, in the shape of high D[undas]
     Gaping with giddy terror o'er the brow;
     In vain he struggles, the fates behind him press,
     And clam'rous hell yawns for her prey below:
     How fallen That, whose pride late scaled the skies!
     And This, like Lucifer, no more to rise!
     Again pronounce the powerful word;
     See Day, triumphant from the night, restored.

     Then know this truth, ye Sons of Men!
     (Thus ends thy moral tale,)
     Your darkest terrors may be vain,
     Your brightest hopes may fail.

      Epistle To James Tennant Of Glenconner
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Auld comrade dear, and brither sinner,
     How's a' the folk about Glenconner?
     How do you this blae eastlin wind,
     That's like to blaw a body blind?
     For me, my faculties are frozen,
     My dearest member nearly dozen'd.
     I've sent you here, by Johnie Simson,
     Twa sage philosophers to glimpse on;
     Smith, wi' his sympathetic feeling,
     An' Reid, to common sense appealing.
     Philosophers have fought and wrangled,
     An' meikle Greek an' Latin mangled,
     Till wi' their logic-jargon tir'd,
     And in the depth of science mir'd,
     To common sense they now appeal,
     What wives and wabsters see and feel.
     But, hark ye, friend! I charge you strictly,
     Peruse them, an' return them quickly:
     For now I'm grown sae cursed douce
     I pray and ponder butt the house;
     My shins, my lane, I there sit roastin',
     Perusing Bunyan, Brown, an' Boston,
     Till by an' by, if I haud on,
     I'll grunt a real gospel-groan:
     Already I begin to try it,
     To cast my e'en up like a pyet,
     When by the gun she tumbles o'er
     Flutt'ring an' gasping in her gore:
     Sae shortly you shall see me bright,
     A burning an' a shining light.

     My heart-warm love to guid auld Glen,
     The ace an' wale of honest men:
     When bending down wi' auld grey hairs
     Beneath the load of years and cares,
     May He who made him still support him,
     An' views beyond the grave comfort him;
     His worthy fam'ly far and near,
     God bless them a' wi' grace and gear!

     My auld schoolfellow, Preacher Willie,
     The manly tar, my mason-billie,
     And Auchenbay, I wish him joy,
     If he's a parent, lass or boy,
     May he be dad, and Meg the mither,
     Just five-and-forty years thegither!
     And no forgetting wabster Charlie,
     I'm tauld he offers very fairly.
     An' Lord, remember singing Sannock,
     Wi' hale breeks, saxpence, an' a bannock!
     And next, my auld acquaintance, Nancy,
     Since she is fitted to her fancy,
     An' her kind stars hae airted till her
     gA guid chiel wi' a pickle siller.
     My kindest, best respects, I sen' it,
     To cousin Kate, an' sister Janet:
     Tell them, frae me, wi' chiels be cautious,
     For, faith, they'll aiblins fin' them fashious;
     To grant a heart is fairly civil,
     But to grant a maidenhead's the devil.
     An' lastly, Jamie, for yoursel,
     May guardian angels tak a spell,
     An' steer you seven miles south o' hell:
     But first, before you see heaven's glory,
     May ye get mony a merry story,
     Mony a laugh, and mony a drink,
     And aye eneugh o' needfu' clink.

     Now fare ye weel, an' joy be wi' you:
     For my sake, this I beg it o' you,
     Assist poor Simson a' ye can,
     Ye'll fin; him just an honest man;
     Sae I conclude, and quat my chanter,
     Your's, saint or sinner,
     Rob the Ranter.

    <h2>
      A New Psalm For The Chapel Of Kilmarnock
    </h2>
    <h3>
      On the Thanksgiving-Day for His Majesty's Recovery.
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     O sing a new song to the Lord,
     Make, all and every one,
     A joyful noise, even for the King
     His restoration.

     The sons of Belial in the land
     Did set their heads together;
     Come, let us sweep them off, said they,
     Like an o'erflowing river.

     They set their heads together, I say,
     They set their heads together;
     On right, on left, on every hand,
     We saw none to deliver.

     Thou madest strong two chosen ones
     To quell the Wicked's pride;
     That Young Man, great in Issachar,
     The burden-bearing tribe.

     And him, among the Princes chief
     In our Jerusalem,
     The judge that's mighty in thy law,
     The man that fears thy name.

     Yet they, even they, with all their strength,
     Began to faint and fail:
     Even as two howling, ravenous wolves
     To dogs do turn their tail.

     Th' ungodly o'er the just prevail'd,
     For so thou hadst appointed;
     That thou might'st greater glory give
     Unto thine own anointed.

     And now thou hast restored our State,
     Pity our Kirk also;
     For she by tribulations
     Is now brought very low.

     Consume that high-place, Patronage,
     From off thy holy hill;
     And in thy fury burn the book—
     Even of that man M'Gill.^1

     Now hear our prayer, accept our song,
     And fight thy chosen's battle:
     We seek but little, Lord, from thee,
     Thou kens we get as little.

     [Footnote 1: Dr. William M'Gill of Ayr, whose “Practical
     Essay on the Death of Jesus Christ” led to a charge of
     heresy against him. Burns took up his cause in “The Kirk of
     Scotland's Alarm” (p. 351).—Lang.]

    <h2>
      Sketch In Verse
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Inscribed to the Right Hon. C. J. Fox.

     How wisdom and Folly meet, mix, and unite,
     How Virtue and Vice blend their black and their white,
     How Genius, th' illustrious father of fiction,
     Confounds rule and law, reconciles contradiction,
     I sing: If these mortals, the critics, should bustle,
     I care not, not I—let the Critics go whistle!

     But now for a Patron whose name and whose glory,
     At once may illustrate and honour my story.

     Thou first of our orators, first of our wits;
     Yet whose parts and acquirements seem just lucky hits;
     With knowledge so vast, and with judgment so strong,
     No man with the half of 'em e'er could go wrong;
     With passions so potent, and fancies so bright,
     No man with the half of 'em e'er could go right;
     A sorry, poor, misbegot son of the Muses,
     For using thy name, offers fifty excuses.
     Good Lord, what is Man! for as simple he looks,
     Do but try to develop his hooks and his crooks;
     With his depths and his shallows, his good and his evil,
     All in all he's a problem must puzzle the devil.

     On his one ruling passion Sir Pope hugely labours,
     That, like th' old Hebrew walking-switch, eats up its neighbours:
     Mankind are his show-box—a friend, would you know him?
     Pull the string, Ruling Passion the picture will show him,
     What pity, in rearing so beauteous a system,
     One trifling particular, Truth, should have miss'd him;
     For, spite of his fine theoretic positions,
     Mankind is a science defies definitions.

     Some sort all our qualities each to its tribe,
     And think human nature they truly describe;
     Have you found this, or t'other? There's more in the wind;
     As by one drunken fellow his comrades you'll find.
     But such is the flaw, or the depth of the plan,
     In the make of that wonderful creature called Man,
     No two virtues, whatever relation they claim.
     Nor even two different shades of the same,
     Though like as was ever twin brother to brother,
     Possessing the one shall imply you've the other.

     But truce with abstraction, and truce with a Muse
     Whose rhymes you'll perhaps, Sir, ne'er deign to peruse:
     Will you leave your justings, your jars, and your quarrels,
     Contending with Billy for proud-nodding laurels?
     My much-honour'd Patron, believe your poor poet,
     Your courage, much more than your prudence, you show it:
     In vain with Squire Billy for laurels you struggle:
     He'll have them by fair trade, if not, he will smuggle:
     Not cabinets even of kings would conceal 'em,
     He'd up the back stairs, and by God, he would steal 'em,
     Then feats like Squire Billy's you ne'er can achieve 'em;
     It is not, out-do him—the task is, out-thieve him!

      The Wounded Hare

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Inhuman man! curse on thy barb'rous art,
     And blasted be thy murder-aiming eye;
     May never pity soothe thee with a sigh,
     Nor ever pleasure glad thy cruel heart!

     Go live, poor wand'rer of the wood and field!
     The bitter little that of life remains:
     No more the thickening brakes and verdant plains
     To thee a home, or food, or pastime yield.

     Seek, mangled wretch, some place of wonted rest,
     No more of rest, but now thy dying bed!
     The sheltering rushes whistling o'er thy head,
     The cold earth with thy bloody bosom prest.

     Perhaps a mother's anguish adds its woe;
     The playful pair crowd fondly by thy side;
     Ah! helpless nurslings, who will now provide
     That life a mother only can bestow!

     Oft as by winding Nith I, musing, wait
     The sober eve, or hail the cheerful dawn,
     I'll miss thee sporting o'er the dewy lawn,
     And curse the ruffian's aim, and mourn thy hapless fate.

     More lovely far her beauty shows.

     Sweet the lark's wild warbled lay,
     Sweet the tinkling rill to hear;
     But, Delia, more delightful still,
     Steal thine accents on mine ear.

     The flower-enamour'd busy bee
     The rosy banquet loves to sip;
     Sweet the streamlet's limpid lapse

     With love and sleep opprest;
     When Willie, wand'ring thro' the wood,
     Who for her favour oft had sued;
     He gaz'd, he wish'd
     He fear'd, he blush'd,
     And trembled where he stood.

     Her closed eyes, like weapons sheath'd,
     Were seal'd in soft repose;
     Her lip, still as she fragrant breath'd,
     It richer dyed the rose;
     The springing lilies, sweetly prest,
     Wild-wanton kissed her rival breast;
     He gaz'd, he wish'd,
     He mear'd, he blush'd,
     His bosom ill at rest.

     Her robes, light-waving in the breeze,
     Her tender limbs embrace;
     Her lovely form, her native ease,
     All harmony and grace;
     Tumultuous tides his pulses roll,
     A faltering, ardent kiss he stole;
     He gaz'd, he wish'd,
     He fear'd, he blush'd,
     And sigh'd his very soul.

     As flies the partridge from the brake,
     On fear-inspired wings,
     So Nelly, starting, half-awake,
     Away affrighted springs;
     But Willie follow'd—as he should,
     He overtook her in the wood;
     He vow'd, he pray'd,
     He found the maid
     Forgiving all, and good.

      Song—Tam Glen
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     My heart is a-breaking, dear Tittie,
     Some counsel unto me come len',
     To anger them a' is a pity,
     But what will I do wi' Tam Glen?

     I'm thinking, wi' sic a braw fellow,
     In poortith I might mak a fen;
     What care I in riches to wallow,
     If I maunna marry Tam Glen!

     There's Lowrie the Laird o' Dumeller—
     “Gude day to you, brute!” he comes ben:
     He brags and he blaws o' his siller,
     But when will he dance like Tam Glen!

     My minnie does constantly deave me,
     And bids me beware o' young men;
     They flatter, she says, to deceive me,
     But wha can think sae o' Tam Glen!

     My daddie says, gin I'll forsake him,
     He'd gie me gude hunder marks ten;
     But, if it's ordain'd I maun take him,
     O wha will I get but Tam Glen!

     Yestreen at the Valentine's dealing,
     My heart to my mou' gied a sten';
     For thrice I drew ane without failing,
     And thrice it was written “Tam Glen”!

     The last Halloween I was waukin
     My droukit sark-sleeve, as ye ken,
     His likeness came up the house staukin,
     And the very grey breeks o' Tam Glen!

     Come, counsel, dear Tittie, don't tarry;
     I'll gie ye my bonie black hen,
     Gif ye will advise me to marry
     The lad I lo'e dearly, Tam Glen.

      On The Late Captain Grose's Peregrinations Thro' Scotland
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Collecting The Antiquities Of That Kingdom
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Hear, Land o' Cakes, and brither Scots,
     Frae Maidenkirk to Johnie Groat's;—
     If there's a hole in a' your coats,
     I rede you tent it:
     A chield's amang you takin notes,
     And, faith, he'll prent it:

     If in your bounds ye chance to light
     Upon a fine, fat fodgel wight,
     O' stature short, but genius bright,
     That's he, mark weel;
     And wow! he has an unco sleight
     O' cauk and keel.

     By some auld, houlet-haunted biggin,
     Or kirk deserted by its riggin,
     It's ten to ane ye'll find him snug in
     Some eldritch part,
     Wi' deils, they say, Lord save's! colleaguin
     At some black art.

     Ilk ghaist that haunts auld ha' or chaumer,
     Ye gipsy-gang that deal in glamour,
     And you, deep-read in hell's black grammar,
     Warlocks and witches,
     Ye'll quake at his conjuring hammer,
     Ye midnight bitches.

     It's tauld he was a sodger bred,
     And ane wad rather fa'n than fled;
     But now he's quat the spurtle-blade,
     And dog-skin wallet,
     And taen the—Antiquarian trade,
     I think they call it.

     He has a fouth o' auld nick-nackets:
     Rusty airn caps and jinglin jackets,
     Wad haud the Lothians three in tackets,
     A towmont gude;
     And parritch-pats and auld saut-backets,
     Before the Flood.

     Of Eve's first fire he has a cinder;
     Auld Tubalcain's fire-shool and fender;
     That which distinguished the gender
     O' Balaam's ass:
     A broomstick o' the witch of Endor,
     Weel shod wi' brass.

     Forbye, he'll shape you aff fu' gleg
     The cut of Adam's philibeg;
     The knife that nickit Abel's craig
     He'll prove you fully,
     It was a faulding jocteleg,
     Or lang-kail gullie.

     But wad ye see him in his glee,
     For meikle glee and fun has he,
     Then set him down, and twa or three
     Gude fellows wi' him:
     And port, O port! shine thou a wee,
     And Then ye'll see him!

     Now, by the Pow'rs o' verse and prose!
     Thou art a dainty chield, O Grose!—
     Whae'er o' thee shall ill suppose,
     They sair misca' thee;
     I'd take the rascal by the nose,
     Wad say, “Shame fa' thee!”

      I saw the battle, sair and teugh,
     And reekin-red ran mony a sheugh;

      The Whistle—A Ballad
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     I sing of a Whistle, a Whistle of worth,
     I sing of a Whistle, the pride of the North.
     Was brought to the court of our good Scottish King,
     And long with this Whistle all Scotland shall ring.

     Old Loda, still rueing the arm of Fingal,
     The god of the bottle sends down from his hall—
     “The Whistle's your challenge, to Scotland get o'er,
     And drink them to hell, Sir! or ne'er see me more!”

     Old poets have sung, and old chronicles tell,
     What champions ventur'd, what champions fell:
     The son of great Loda was conqueror still,
     And blew on the Whistle their requiem shrill.

     Till Robert, the lord of the Cairn and the Scaur,
     Unmatch'd at the bottle, unconquer'd in war,
     He drank his poor god-ship as deep as the sea;
     No tide of the Baltic e'er drunker than he.

     Thus Robert, victorious, the trophy has gain'd;
     Which now in his house has for ages remain'd;
     Till three noble chieftains, and all of his blood,
     The jovial contest again have renew'd.

     Three joyous good fellows, with hearts clear of flaw
     Craigdarroch, so famous for with, worth, and law;
     And trusty Glenriddel, so skill'd in old coins;
     And gallant Sir Robert, deep-read in old wines.

     Craigdarroch began, with a tongue smooth as oil,
     Desiring Downrightly to yield up the spoil;
     Or else he would muster the heads of the clan,
     And once more, in claret, try which was the man.

     “By the gods of the ancients!” Downrightly replies,
     “Before I surrender so glorious a prize,
     I'll conjure the ghost of the great Rorie More,
     And bumper his horn with him twenty times o'er.”

     Sir Robert, a soldier, no speech would pretend,
     But he ne'er turn'd his back on his foe, or his friend;
     Said, “Toss down the Whistle, the prize of the field,”
      And, knee-deep in claret, he'd die ere he'd yield.

     To the board of Glenriddel our heroes repair,
     So noted for drowning of sorrow and care;
     But, for wine and for welcome, not more known to fame,
     Than the sense, wit, and taste, of a sweet lovely dame.

     A bard was selected to witness the fray,
     And tell future ages the feats of the day;
     A Bard who detested all sadness and spleen,
     And wish'd that Parnassus a vineyard had been.

     The dinner being over, the claret they ply,
     And ev'ry new cork is a new spring of joy;
     In the bands of old friendship and kindred so set,
     And the bands grew the tighter the more they were wet.

     Gay Pleasure ran riot as bumpers ran o'er:
     Bright Phoebus ne'er witness'd so joyous a core,
     And vow'd that to leave them he was quite forlorn,
     Till Cynthia hinted he'd see them next morn.

     Six bottles a-piece had well wore out the night,
     When gallant Sir Robert, to finish the fight,
     Turn'd o'er in one bumper a bottle of red,
     And swore 'twas the way that their ancestor did.

     Then worthy Glenriddel, so cautious and sage,
     No longer the warfare ungodly would wage;
     A high Ruling Elder to wallow in wine;
     He left the foul business to folks less divine.

     The gallant Sir Robert fought hard to the end;
     But who can with Fate and quart bumpers contend!
     Though Fate said, a hero should perish in light;
     So uprose bright Phoebus—and down fell the knight.

     Next uprose our Bard, like a prophet in drink:—
     “Craigdarroch, thou'lt soar when creation shall sink!
     But if thou would flourish immortal in rhyme,
     Come—one bottle more—and have at the sublime!

     “Thy line, that have struggled for freedom with Bruce,
     Shall heroes and patriots ever produce:
     So thine be the laurel, and mine be the bay;
     The field thou hast won, by yon bright god of day!”

     Where is thy place of blissful rest?

     Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast?

     That sacred hour can I forget,
     Can I forget the hallow'd grove,

     Eternity will not efface
     Those records dear of transports past,
     Thy image at our last embrace,
     Ah! little thought we 'twas our last!

     Ayr, gurgling, kiss'd his pebbled shore,
     O'erhung with wild-woods, thickening green;
     The fragrant birch and hawthorn hoar,
     'Twin'd amorous round the raptur'd scene:
     The flowers sprang wanton to be prest,
     The birds sang love on every spray;
     Till too, too soon, the glowing west,
     Proclaim'd the speed of winged day.

     Still o'er these scenes my mem'ry wakes,
     And fondly broods with miser-care;
     Time but th' impression stronger makes,
     As streams their channels deeper wear,
     My Mary! dear departed shade!

     Wow, but your letter made me vauntie!
     And are ye hale, and weel and cantie?
     I ken'd it still, your wee bit jauntie
     Wad bring ye to:
     Lord send you aye as weel's I want ye!
     And then ye'll do.

     The ill-thief blaw the Heron south!
     And never drink be near his drouth!
     He tauld myself by word o' mouth,
     He'd tak my letter;
     I lippen'd to the chiel in trouth,
     And bade nae better.

     But aiblins, honest Master Heron
     Had, at the time, some dainty fair one
     To ware this theologic care on,
     And holy study;
     And tired o' sauls to waste his lear on,
     E'en tried the body.

     But what d'ye think, my trusty fere,
     I'm turned a gauger—Peace be here!
     Parnassian queans, I fear, I fear,
     Ye'll now disdain me!
     And then my fifty pounds a year
     Will little gain me.

     Ye glaikit, gleesome, dainty damies,
     Wha, by Castalia's wimplin streamies,
     Lowp, sing, and lave your pretty limbies,
     Ye ken, ye ken,
     That strang necessity supreme is
     'Mang sons o' men.

     I hae a wife and twa wee laddies;
     They maun hae brose and brats o' duddies;
     Ye ken yoursels my heart right proud is—
     I need na vaunt
     But I'll sned besoms, thraw saugh woodies,
     Before they want.

     Lord help me thro' this warld o' care!
     I'm weary sick o't late and air!
     Not but I hae a richer share
     Than mony ithers;
     But why should ae man better fare,
     And a' men brithers?

     Come, Firm Resolve, take thou the van,
     Thou stalk o' carl-hemp in man!
     And let us mind, faint heart ne'er wan
     A lady fair:
     Wha does the utmost that he can,
     Will whiles do mair.

     But to conclude my silly rhyme
     (I'm scant o' verse and scant o' time),
     To make a happy fireside clime
     To weans and wife,
     That's the true pathos and sublime
     Of human life.

     My compliments to sister Beckie,
     And eke the same to honest Lucky;
     I wat she is a daintie chuckie,
     As e'er tread clay;
     And gratefully, my gude auld cockie,
     I'm yours for aye.
     Robert Burns.

      The Five Carlins
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     An Election Ballad.

     Tune—“Chevy Chase.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     There was five Carlins in the South,
     They fell upon a scheme,
     To send a lad to London town,
     To bring them tidings hame.

     Nor only bring them tidings hame,
     But do their errands there,
     And aiblins gowd and honor baith
     Might be that laddie's share.

     There was Maggy by the banks o' Nith,
     A dame wi' pride eneugh;
     And Marjory o' the mony Lochs,
     A Carlin auld and teugh.

     And blinkin Bess of Annandale,
     That dwelt near Solway-side;
     And whisky Jean, that took her gill,
     In Galloway sae wide.

     And auld black Joan frae Crichton Peel,^1
     O' gipsy kith an' kin;
     Five wighter Carlins were na found
     The South countrie within.

     To send a lad to London town,
     They met upon a day;
     And mony a knight, and mony a laird,
     This errand fain wad gae.

     O mony a knight, and mony a laird,
     This errand fain wad gae;
     But nae ane could their fancy please,
     O ne'er a ane but twae.

     The first ane was a belted Knight,
     Bred of a Border band;^2
     And he wad gae to London town,
     Might nae man him withstand.

     And he wad do their errands weel,
     And meikle he wad say;
     And ilka ane about the court
     Wad bid to him gude-day.

     [Footnote 1: Sanquhar.]

     [Footnote 2: Sir James Johnston of Westerhall.]

     The neist cam in a Soger youth,^3
     Who spak wi' modest grace,
     And he wad gae to London town,
     If sae their pleasure was.

     He wad na hecht them courtly gifts,
     Nor meikle speech pretend;
     But he wad hecht an honest heart,
     Wad ne'er desert his friend.

     Now, wham to chuse, and wham refuse,
     At strife thir Carlins fell;
     For some had Gentlefolks to please,
     And some wad please themsel'.

     Then out spak mim-mou'd Meg o' Nith,
     And she spak up wi' pride,
     And she wad send the Soger youth,
     Whatever might betide.

     For the auld Gudeman o' London court^4
     She didna care a pin;
     But she wad send the Soger youth,
     To greet his eldest son.^5

     Then up sprang Bess o' Annandale,
     And a deadly aith she's ta'en,
     That she wad vote the Border Knight,
     Though she should vote her lane.

     “For far-off fowls hae feathers fair,
     And fools o' change are fain;
     But I hae tried the Border Knight,
     And I'll try him yet again.”

     Says black Joan frae Crichton Peel,
     A Carlin stoor and grim.
     “The auld Gudeman or young Gudeman,
     For me may sink or swim;

     [Footnote 3: Captain Patrick Millar of Dalswinton.]

     [Footnote 4: The King.]

     [Footnote 5: The Prince of Wales.]

     For fools will prate o' right or wrang,
     While knaves laugh them to scorn;
     But the Soger's friends hae blawn the best,
     So he shall bear the horn.”

     Then whisky Jean spak owre her drink,
     “Ye weel ken, kimmers a',
     The auld gudeman o' London court,
     His back's been at the wa';

     “And mony a friend that kiss'd his caup
     Is now a fremit wight;
     But it's ne'er be said o' whisky Jean—
     We'll send the Border Knight.”

     Then slow raise Marjory o' the Lochs,
     And wrinkled was her brow,
     Her ancient weed was russet gray,
     Her auld Scots bluid was true;

     “There's some great folk set light by me,
     I set as light by them;
     But I will send to London town
     Wham I like best at hame.”

     Sae how this mighty plea may end,
     Nae mortal wight can tell;
     God grant the King and ilka man
     May look weel to himsel.

    <h2>
      Prologue Spoken At The Theatre Of Dumfries
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     On New Year's Day Evening, 1790.

     No song nor dance I bring from yon great city,
     That queens it o'er our taste—the more's the pity:
     Tho' by the bye, abroad why will you roam?
     Good sense and taste are natives here at home:
     But not for panegyric I appear,
     I come to wish you all a good New Year!
     Old Father Time deputes me here before ye,
     Not for to preach, but tell his simple story:
     The sage, grave Ancient cough'd, and bade me say,
     “You're one year older this important day,”
      If wiser too—he hinted some suggestion,
     But 'twould be rude, you know, to ask the question;
     And with a would-be roguish leer and wink,
     Said—“Sutherland, in one word, bid them Think!”

     Ye sprightly youths, quite flush with hope and spirit,
     Who think to storm the world by dint of merit,
     To you the dotard has a deal to say,
     In his sly, dry, sententious, proverb way!
     He bids you mind, amid your thoughtless rattle,
     That the first blow is ever half the battle;
     That tho' some by the skirt may try to snatch him,
     Yet by the foreclock is the hold to catch him;
     That whether doing, suffering, or forbearing,
     You may do miracles by persevering.

     Last, tho' not least in love, ye youthful fair,
     Angelic forms, high Heaven's peculiar care!
     To you old Bald-pate smoothes his wrinkled brow,
     And humbly begs you'll mind the important—Now!
     To crown your happiness he asks your leave,
     And offers, bliss to give and to receive.

     For our sincere, tho' haply weak endeavours,
     With grateful pride we own your many favours;
     And howsoe'er our tongues may ill reveal it,
     Believe our glowing bosoms truly feel it.

      Sketch—New Year's Day, 1790
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     To Mrs. Dunlop.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     This day, Time winds th' exhausted chain;
     To run the twelvemonth's length again:
     I see, the old bald-pated fellow,
     With ardent eyes, complexion sallow,
     Adjust the unimpair'd machine,
     To wheel the equal, dull routine.

     The absent lover, minor heir,
     In vain assail him with their prayer;
     Deaf as my friend, he sees them press,
     Nor makes the hour one moment less,
     Will you (the Major's with the hounds,
     The happy tenants share his rounds;
     Coila's fair Rachel's care to-day,
     And blooming Keith's engaged with Gray)
     From housewife cares a minute borrow,
     (That grandchild's cap will do to-morrow,)
     And join with me a-moralizing;
     This day's propitious to be wise in.

     First, what did yesternight deliver?
     “Another year has gone for ever.”
      And what is this day's strong suggestion?
     “The passing moment's all we rest on!”
      Rest on—for what? what do we here?
     Or why regard the passing year?
     Will Time, amus'd with proverb'd lore,
     Add to our date one minute more?
     A few days may—a few years must—
     Repose us in the silent dust.
     Then, is it wise to damp our bliss?
     Yes—all such reasonings are amiss!
     The voice of Nature loudly cries,
     And many a message from the skies,
     That something in us never dies:
     That on his frail, uncertain state,
     Hang matters of eternal weight:
     That future life in worlds unknown
     Must take its hue from this alone;
     Whether as heavenly glory bright,
     Or dark as Misery's woeful night.

     Since then, my honour'd first of friends,
     On this poor being all depends,
     Let us th' important now employ,
     And live as those who never die.
     Tho' you, with days and honours crown'd,
     Witness that filial circle round,
     (A sight life's sorrows to repulse,
     A sight pale Envy to convulse),
     Others now claim your chief regard;
     Yourself, you wait your bright reward.

    <h2>
      Scots' Prologue For Mr. Sutherland
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     On his Benefit-Night, at the Theatre, Dumfries.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     What needs this din about the town o' Lon'on,
     How this new play an' that new sang is comin?
     Why is outlandish stuff sae meikle courted?
     Does nonsense mend, like brandy, when imported?
     Is there nae poet, burning keen for fame,
     Will try to gie us sangs and plays at hame?
     For Comedy abroad he need to toil,
     A fool and knave are plants of every soil;
     Nor need he hunt as far as Rome or Greece,
     To gather matter for a serious piece;
     There's themes enow in Caledonian story,
     Would shew the Tragic Muse in a' her glory.—

     Is there no daring Bard will rise and tell
     How glorious Wallace stood, how hapless fell?
     Where are the Muses fled that could produce
     A drama worthy o' the name o' Bruce?
     How here, even here, he first unsheath'd the sword
     'Gainst mighty England and her guilty Lord;
     And after mony a bloody, deathless doing,
     Wrench'd his dear country from the jaws of Ruin!
     O for a Shakespeare, or an Otway scene,
     To draw the lovely, hapless Scottish Queen!
     Vain all th' omnipotence of female charms
     'Gainst headlong, ruthless, mad Rebellion's arms:
     She fell, but fell with spirit truly Roman,
     To glut that direst foe—a vengeful woman;
     A woman, (tho' the phrase may seem uncivil,)
     As able and as wicked as the Devil!
     One Douglas lives in Home's immortal page,
     But Douglasses were heroes every age:
     And tho' your fathers, prodigal of life,
     A Douglas followed to the martial strife,
     Perhaps, if bowls row right, and Right succeeds,
     Ye yet may follow where a Douglas leads!

     As ye hae generous done, if a' the land
     Would take the Muses' servants by the hand;
     Not only hear, but patronize, befriend them,
     And where he justly can commend, commend them;
     And aiblins when they winna stand the test,
     Wink hard, and say The folks hae done their best!
     Would a' the land do this, then I'll be caition,
     Ye'll soon hae Poets o' the Scottish nation
     Will gar Fame blaw until her trumpet crack,
     And warsle Time, an' lay him on his back!

     For us and for our Stage, should ony spier,
     “Whase aught thae chiels maks a' this bustle here?”
      My best leg foremost, I'll set up my brow—
     We have the honour to belong to you!
     We're your ain bairns, e'en guide us as ye like,
     But like good mithers shore before ye strike;
     And gratefu' still, I trust ye'll ever find us,
     For gen'rous patronage, and meikle kindness
     We've got frae a' professions, sets and ranks:
     God help us! we're but poor—ye'se get but thanks.

     This mony a day I've grain'd and gaunted,

     If Denmark, any body spak o't;

     How libbet Italy was singin;

     If Spaniard, Portuguese, or Swiss,
     Were sayin' or takin' aught amiss;
     Or how our merry lads at hame,
     In Britain's court kept up the game;
     How royal George, the Lord leuk o'er him!
     Was managing St. Stephen's quorum;
     If sleekit Chatham Will was livin,
     Or glaikit Charlie got his nieve in;
     How daddie Burke the plea was cookin,
     If Warren Hasting's neck was yeukin;
     How cesses, stents, and fees were rax'd.
     Or if bare arses yet were tax'd;
     The news o' princes, dukes, and earls,
     Pimps, sharpers, bawds, and opera-girls;
     If that daft buckie, Geordie Wales,
     Was threshing still at hizzies' tails;
     Or if he was grown oughtlins douser,
     And no a perfect kintra cooser:
     A' this and mair I never heard of;
     And, but for you, I might despair'd of.
     So, gratefu', back your news I send you,
     And pray a' gude things may attend you.

     An ye drink it a', ye'll find him out.
     Then gudewife, &amp;c.

    <h2>
      Election Ballad
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">    At the close of the contest for representing the Dumfries Burghs, 1790.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Addressed to R. Graham, Esq. of Fintry.

     Fintry, my stay in wordly strife,
     Friend o' my muse, friend o' my life,
     Are ye as idle's I am?
     Come then, wi' uncouth kintra fleg,
     O'er Pegasus I'll fling my leg,
     And ye shall see me try him.

     But where shall I go rin a ride,
     That I may splatter nane beside?
     I wad na be uncivil:
     In manhood's various paths and ways
     There's aye some doytin' body strays,
     And I ride like the devil.

     Thus I break aff wi' a' my birr,
     And down yon dark, deep alley spur,
     Where Theologics daunder:
     Alas! curst wi' eternal fogs,
     And damn'd in everlasting bogs,
     As sure's the creed I'll blunder!

     I'll stain a band, or jaup a gown,
     Or rin my reckless, guilty crown
     Against the haly door:
     Sair do I rue my luckless fate,
     When, as the Muse an' Deil wad hae't,
     I rade that road before.

     Suppose I take a spurt, and mix
     Amang the wilds o' Politics—
     Electors and elected,
     Where dogs at Court (sad sons of bitches!)
     Septennially a madness touches,
     Till all the land's infected.

     All hail! Drumlanrig's haughty Grace,
     Discarded remnant of a race
     Once godlike—great in story;
     Thy forbears' virtues all contrasted,
     The very name of Douglas blasted,
     Thine that inverted glory!

     Hate, envy, oft the Douglas bore,
     But thou hast superadded more,
     And sunk them in contempt;
     Follies and crimes have stain'd the name,
     But, Queensberry, thine the virgin claim,
     From aught that's good exempt!

     I'll sing the zeal Drumlanrig bears,
     Who left the all-important cares
     Of princes, and their darlings:
     And, bent on winning borough touns,
     Came shaking hands wi' wabster-loons,
     And kissing barefit carlins.

     Combustion thro' our boroughs rode,
     Whistling his roaring pack abroad
     Of mad unmuzzled lions;
     As Queensberry blue and buff unfurl'd,
     And Westerha' and Hopetoun hurled
     To every Whig defiance.

     But cautious Queensberry left the war,
     Th' unmanner'd dust might soil his star,
     Besides, he hated bleeding:
     But left behind him heroes bright,
     Heroes in Caesarean fight,
     Or Ciceronian pleading.

     O for a throat like huge Mons-Meg,
     To muster o'er each ardent Whig
     Beneath Drumlanrig's banners;
     Heroes and heroines commix,
     All in the field of politics,
     To win immortal honours.

     M'Murdo and his lovely spouse,
     (Th' enamour'd laurels kiss her brows!)
     Led on the Loves and Graces:
     She won each gaping burgess' heart,
     While he, sub rosa, played his part
     Amang their wives and lasses.

     Craigdarroch led a light-arm'd core,
     Tropes, metaphors, and figures pour,
     Like Hecla streaming thunder:
     Glenriddel, skill'd in rusty coins,
     Blew up each Tory's dark designs,
     And bared the treason under.

     In either wing two champions fought;
     Redoubted Staig, who set at nought
     The wildest savage Tory;
     And Welsh who ne'er yet flinch'd his ground,
     High-wav'd his magnum-bonum round
     With Cyclopeian fury.

     Miller brought up th' artillery ranks,
     The many-pounders of the Banks,
     Resistless desolation!
     While Maxwelton, that baron bold,
     'Mid Lawson's port entrench'd his hold,
     And threaten'd worse damnation.

     To these what Tory hosts oppos'd
     With these what Tory warriors clos'd
     Surpasses my descriving;
     Squadrons, extended long and large,
     With furious speed rush to the charge,
     Like furious devils driving.

     What verse can sing, what prose narrate,
     The butcher deeds of bloody Fate,
     Amid this mighty tulyie!
     Grim Horror girn'd, pale Terror roar'd,
     As Murder at his thrapple shor'd,
     And Hell mix'd in the brulyie.

     As Highland craigs by thunder cleft,
     When lightnings fire the stormy lift,
     Hurl down with crashing rattle;
     As flames among a hundred woods,
     As headlong foam from a hundred floods,
     Such is the rage of Battle.

     The stubborn Tories dare to die;
     As soon the rooted oaks would fly
     Before th' approaching fellers:
     The Whigs come on like Ocean's roar,
     When all his wintry billows pour
     Against the Buchan Bullers.

     Lo, from the shades of Death's deep night,
     Departed Whigs enjoy the fight,
     And think on former daring:
     The muffled murtherer of Charles
     The Magna Charter flag unfurls,
     All deadly gules its bearing.

     Nor wanting ghosts of Tory fame;
     Bold Scrimgeour follows gallant Graham;
     Auld Covenanters shiver—
     Forgive! forgive! much-wrong'd Montrose!
     Now Death and Hell engulph thy foes,
     Thou liv'st on high for ever.

     Still o'er the field the combat burns,
     The Tories, Whigs, give way by turns;
     But Fate the word has spoken:
     For woman's wit and strength o'man,
     Alas! can do but what they can;
     The Tory ranks are broken.

     O that my een were flowing burns!
     My voice, a lioness that mourns
     Her darling cubs' undoing!
     That I might greet, that I might cry,
     While Tories fall, while Tories fly,
     And furious Whigs pursuing!

     What Whig but melts for good Sir James,
     Dear to his country, by the names,
     Friend, Patron, Benefactor!
     Not Pulteney's wealth can Pulteney save;
     And Hopetoun falls, the generous, brave;
     And Stewart, bold as Hector.

     Thou, Pitt, shalt rue this overthrow,
     And Thurlow growl a curse of woe,
     And Melville melt in wailing:
     Now Fox and Sheridan rejoice,
     And Burke shall sing, “O Prince, arise!
     Thy power is all-prevailing!”

     For your poor friend, the Bard, afar
     He only hears and sees the war,
     A cool spectator purely!
     So, when the storm the forest rends,
     The robin in the hedge descends,
     And sober chirps securely.

     Now, for my friends' and brethren's sakes,
     And for my dear-lov'd Land o' Cakes,
     I pray with holy fire:
     Lord, send a rough-shod troop o' Hell
     O'er a' wad Scotland buy or sell,
     To grind them in the mire!

      Elegy On Captain Matthew Henderson
    </h2>
    <p>
      A Gentleman who held the Patent for his Honours immediately from Almighty
      God.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Should the poor be flattered?—Shakespeare.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     O Death! thou tyrant fell and bloody!
     The meikle devil wi' a woodie
     Haurl thee hame to his black smiddie,
     O'er hurcheon hides,
     And like stock-fish come o'er his studdie
     Wi' thy auld sides!

     He's gane, he's gane! he's frae us torn,
     The ae best fellow e'er was born!
     Thee, Matthew, Nature's sel' shall mourn,
     By wood and wild,
     Where haply, Pity strays forlorn,
     Frae man exil'd.

     Ye hills, near neighbours o' the starns,
     That proudly cock your cresting cairns!
     Ye cliffs, the haunts of sailing earns,
     Where Echo slumbers!
     Come join, ye Nature's sturdiest bairns,
     My wailing numbers!

     Mourn, ilka grove the cushat kens!
     Ye haz'ly shaws and briery dens!
     Ye burnies, wimplin' down your glens,
     Wi' toddlin din,
     Or foaming, strang, wi' hasty stens,
     Frae lin to lin.

     Mourn, little harebells o'er the lea;
     Ye stately foxgloves, fair to see;
     Ye woodbines hanging bonilie,
     In scented bow'rs;
     Ye roses on your thorny tree,
     The first o' flow'rs.

     At dawn, when ev'ry grassy blade
     Droops with a diamond at his head,
     At ev'n, when beans their fragrance shed,
     I' th' rustling gale,
     Ye maukins, whiddin thro' the glade,
     Come join my wail.

     Mourn, ye wee songsters o' the wood;
     Ye grouse that crap the heather bud;
     Ye curlews, calling thro' a clud;
     Ye whistling plover;
     And mourn, we whirring paitrick brood;
     He's gane for ever!

     Mourn, sooty coots, and speckled teals;
     Ye fisher herons, watching eels;
     Ye duck and drake, wi' airy wheels
     Circling the lake;
     Ye bitterns, till the quagmire reels,
     Rair for his sake.

     Mourn, clam'ring craiks at close o' day,
     'Mang fields o' flow'ring clover gay;
     And when ye wing your annual way
     Frae our claud shore,
     Tell thae far warlds wha lies in clay,
     Wham we deplore.

     Ye houlets, frae your ivy bow'r
     In some auld tree, or eldritch tow'r,
     What time the moon, wi' silent glow'r,
     Sets up her horn,
     Wail thro' the dreary midnight hour,
     Till waukrife morn!

     O rivers, forests, hills, and plains!
     Oft have ye heard my canty strains;
     But now, what else for me remains
     But tales of woe;
     And frae my een the drapping rains
     Maun ever flow.

     Mourn, Spring, thou darling of the year!
     Ilk cowslip cup shall kep a tear:
     Thou, Simmer, while each corny spear
     Shoots up its head,
     Thy gay, green, flow'ry tresses shear,
     For him that's dead!

     Thou, Autumn, wi' thy yellow hair,
     In grief thy sallow mantle tear!
     Thou, Winter, hurling thro' the air
     The roaring blast,
     Wide o'er the naked world declare
     The worth we've lost!

     Mourn him, thou Sun, great source of light!
     Mourn, Empress of the silent night!
     And you, ye twinkling starnies bright,
     My Matthew mourn!
     For through your orbs he's ta'en his flight,
     Ne'er to return.

     O Henderson! the man! the brother!
     And art thou gone, and gone for ever!
     And hast thou crost that unknown river,
     Life's dreary bound!
     Like thee, where shall I find another,
     The world around!

     Go to your sculptur'd tombs, ye Great,
     In a' the tinsel trash o' state!
     But by thy honest turf I'll wait,
     Thou man of worth!
     And weep the ae best fellow's fate
     E'er lay in earth.

      The Epitaph
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Stop, passenger! my story's brief,
     And truth I shall relate, man;
     I tell nae common tale o' grief,
     For Matthew was a great man.

     If thou uncommon merit hast,
     Yet spurn'd at Fortune's door, man;
     A look of pity hither cast,
     For Matthew was a poor man.

     If thou a noble sodger art,
     That passest by this grave, man;
     There moulders here a gallant heart,
     For Matthew was a brave man.

     If thou on men, their works and ways,
     Canst throw uncommon light, man;
     Here lies wha weel had won thy praise,
     For Matthew was a bright man.

     If thou, at Friendship's sacred ca',
     Wad life itself resign, man:
     Thy sympathetic tear maun fa',
     For Matthew was a kind man.

     If thou art staunch, without a stain,
     Like the unchanging blue, man;
     This was a kinsman o' thy ain,
     For Matthew was a true man.

     If thou hast wit, and fun, and fire,
     And ne'er guid wine did fear, man;
     This was thy billie, dam, and sire,
     For Matthew was a queer man.

     If ony whiggish, whingin' sot,
     To blame poor Matthew dare, man;
     May dool and sorrow be his lot,
     For Matthew was a rare man.

     But now, his radiant course is run,
     For Matthew's was a bright one!
     His soul was like the glorious sun,
     A matchless, Heavenly light, man.

    <h2>
      Tam O' Shanter
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     A Tale.

     “Of Brownyis and of Bogillis full is this Buke.”

     Gawin Douglas.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     When chapman billies leave the street,
     And drouthy neibors, neibors, meet;
     As market days are wearing late,
     And folk begin to tak the gate,
     While we sit bousing at the nappy,
     An' getting fou and unco happy,
     We think na on the lang Scots miles,
     The mosses, waters, slaps and stiles,
     That lie between us and our hame,
     Where sits our sulky, sullen dame,
     Gathering her brows like gathering storm,
     Nursing her wrath to keep it warm.

     This truth fand honest Tam o' Shanter,
     As he frae Ayr ae night did canter:
     (Auld Ayr, wham ne'er a town surpasses,
     For honest men and bonie lasses).

     O Tam! had'st thou but been sae wise,
     As taen thy ain wife Kate's advice!
     She tauld thee weel thou was a skellum,
     A blethering, blustering, drunken blellum;
     That frae November till October,
     Ae market-day thou was na sober;
     That ilka melder wi' the Miller,
     Thou sat as lang as thou had siller;
     That ev'ry naig was ca'd a shoe on
     The Smith and thee gat roarin' fou on;
     That at the Lord's house, ev'n on Sunday,
     Thou drank wi' Kirkton Jean till Monday,
     She prophesied that late or soon,
     Thou wad be found, deep drown'd in Doon,
     Or catch'd wi' warlocks in the mirk,
     By Alloway's auld, haunted kirk.

     Ah, gentle dames! it gars me greet,
     To think how mony counsels sweet,
     How mony lengthen'd, sage advices,
     The husband frae the wife despises!

     But to our tale: Ae market night,
     Tam had got planted unco right,
     Fast by an ingle, bleezing finely,
     Wi reaming saats, that drank divinely;
     And at his elbow, Souter Johnie,
     His ancient, trusty, drougthy crony:
     Tam lo'ed him like a very brither;
     They had been fou for weeks thegither.
     The night drave on wi' sangs an' clatter;
     And aye the ale was growing better:
     The Landlady and Tam grew gracious,
     Wi' favours secret, sweet, and precious:
     The Souter tauld his queerest stories;
     The Landlord's laugh was ready chorus:
     The storm without might rair and rustle,
     Tam did na mind the storm a whistle.

     Care, mad to see a man sae happy,
     E'en drown'd himsel amang the nappy.
     As bees flee hame wi' lades o' treasure,
     The minutes wing'd their way wi' pleasure:
     Kings may be blest, but Tam was glorious,
     O'er a' the ills o' life victorious!

     But pleasures are like poppies spread,
     You seize the flow'r, its bloom is shed;
     Or like the snow falls in the river,
     A moment white—then melts for ever;
     Or like the Borealis race,
     That flit ere you can point their place;
     Or like the Rainbow's lovely form
     Evanishing amid the storm.—
     Nae man can tether Time nor Tide,
     The hour approaches Tam maun ride;
     That hour, o' night's black arch the key-stane,
     That dreary hour he mounts his beast in;
     And sic a night he taks the road in,
     As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in.

     The wind blew as 'twad blawn its last;
     The rattling showers rose on the blast;
     The speedy gleams the darkness swallow'd;
     Loud, deep, and lang, the thunder bellow'd:
     That night, a child might understand,
     The deil had business on his hand.

     Weel-mounted on his grey mare, Meg,
     A better never lifted leg,
     Tam skelpit on thro' dub and mire,
     Despising wind, and rain, and fire;
     Whiles holding fast his gude blue bonnet,
     Whiles crooning o'er some auld Scots sonnet,
     Whiles glow'rin round wi' prudent cares,
     Lest bogles catch him unawares;
     Kirk-Alloway was drawing nigh,
     Where ghaists and houlets nightly cry.

     By this time he was cross the ford,
     Where in the snaw the chapman smoor'd;
     And past the birks and meikle stane,
     Where drunken Charlie brak's neck-bane;
     And thro' the whins, and by the cairn,
     Where hunters fand the murder'd bairn;
     And near the thorn, aboon the well,
     Where Mungo's mither hang'd hersel'.
     Before him Doon pours all his floods,
     The doubling storm roars thro' the woods,
     The lightnings flash from pole to pole,
     Near and more near the thunders roll,
     When, glimmering thro' the groaning trees,
     Kirk-Alloway seem'd in a bleeze,
     Thro' ilka bore the beams were glancing,
     And loud resounded mirth and dancing.

     Inspiring bold John Barleycorn!
     What dangers thou canst make us scorn!
     Wi' tippenny, we fear nae evil;
     Wi' usquabae, we'll face the devil!
     The swats sae ream'd in Tammie's noddle,
     Fair play, he car'd na deils a boddle,
     But Maggie stood, right sair astonish'd,
     Till, by the heel and hand admonish'd,
     She ventur'd forward on the light;
     And, wow! Tam saw an unco sight!

     Warlocks and witches in a dance:
     Nae cotillon, brent new frae France,
     But hornpipes, jigs, strathspeys, and reels,
     Put life and mettle in their heels.
     A winnock-bunker in the east,
     There sat auld Nick, in shape o' beast;
     A towzie tyke, black, grim, and large,
     To gie them music was his charge:
     He screw'd the pipes and gart them skirl,
     Till roof and rafters a' did dirl.—
     Coffins stood round, like open presses,
     That shaw'd the Dead in their last dresses;
     And (by some devilish cantraip sleight)
     Each in its cauld hand held a light.
     By which heroic Tam was able
     To note upon the haly table,
     A murderer's banes, in gibbet-airns;
     Twa span-lang, wee, unchristened bairns;
     A thief, new-cutted frae a rape,
     Wi' his last gasp his gabudid gape;
     Five tomahawks, wi' blude red-rusted:
     Five scimitars, wi' murder crusted;
     A garter which a babe had strangled:
     A knife, a father's throat had mangled.
     Whom his ain son of life bereft,
     The grey-hairs yet stack to the heft;
     Wi' mair of horrible and awfu',
     Which even to name wad be unlawfu'.

     As Tammie glowr'd, amaz'd, and curious,
     The mirth and fun grew fast and furious;
     The Piper loud and louder blew,
     The dancers quick and quicker flew,
     The reel'd, they set, they cross'd, they cleekit,
     Till ilka carlin swat and reekit,
     And coost her duddies to the wark,
     And linkit at it in her sark!

     Now Tam, O Tam! had they been queans,
     A' plump and strapping in their teens!
     Their sarks, instead o' creeshie flainen,
     Been snaw-white seventeen hunder linen!—
     Thir breeks o' mine, my only pair,
     That ance were plush o' guid blue hair,
     I wad hae gien them off my hurdies,
     For ae blink o' the bonie burdies!
     But wither'd beldams, auld and droll,
     Rigwoodie hags wad spean a foal,
     Louping an' flinging on a crummock.
     I wonder did na turn thy stomach.

     But Tam kent what was what fu' brawlie:
     There was ae winsome wench and waulie
     That night enlisted in the core,
     Lang after ken'd on Carrick shore;
     (For mony a beast to dead she shot,
     And perish'd mony a bonie boat,
     And shook baith meikle corn and bear,
     And kept the country-side in fear);
     Her cutty sark, o' Paisley harn,
     That while a lassie she had worn,
     In longitude tho' sorely scanty,
     It was her best, and she was vauntie.
     Ah! little ken'd thy reverend grannie,
     That sark she coft for her wee Nannie,
     Wi twa pund Scots ('twas a' her riches),
     Wad ever grac'd a dance of witches!

     But here my Muse her wing maun cour,
     Sic flights are far beyond her power;
     To sing how Nannie lap and flang,
     (A souple jade she was and strang),
     And how Tam stood, like ane bewithc'd,
     And thought his very een enrich'd:
     Even Satan glowr'd, and fidg'd fu' fain,
     And hotch'd and blew wi' might and main:
     Till first ae caper, syne anither,
     Tam tint his reason a thegither,
     And roars out, “Weel done, Cutty-sark!”
      And in an instant all was dark:
     And scarcely had he Maggie rallied.
     When out the hellish legion sallied.

     As bees bizz out wi' angry fyke,
     When plundering herds assail their byke;
     As open pussie's mortal foes,
     When, pop! she starts before their nose;
     As eager runs the market-crowd,
     When “Catch the thief!” resounds aloud;
     So Maggie runs, the witches follow,
     Wi' mony an eldritch skreich and hollow.

     Ah, Tam! Ah, Tam! thou'll get thy fairin!
     In hell, they'll roast thee like a herrin!
     In vain thy Kate awaits thy comin!
     Kate soon will be a woefu' woman!
     Now, do thy speedy-utmost, Meg,
     And win the key-stone o' the brig;^1
     There, at them thou thy tail may toss,
     A running stream they dare na cross.
     But ere the keystane she could make,
     The fient a tail she had to shake!
     For Nannie, far before the rest,
     Hard upon noble Maggie prest,
     And flew at Tam wi' furious ettle;
     But little wist she Maggie's mettle!
     Ae spring brought off her master hale,
     But left behind her ain grey tail:
     The carlin claught her by the rump,
     And left poor Maggie scarce a stump.

     Now, wha this tale o' truth shall read,
     Ilk man and mother's son, take heed:
     Whene'er to Drink you are inclin'd,
     Or Cutty-sarks rin in your mind,
     Think ye may buy the joys o'er dear;
     Remember Tam o' Shanter's mare.

     November hirples o'er the lea,

     And gane, alas! the shelt'ring tree,

     [Footnote 1: It is a well-known fact that witches, or any evil

      Elegy On The Late Miss Burnet Of Monboddo
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Life ne'er exulted in so rich a prize,
     As Burnet, lovely from her native skies;
     Nor envious death so triumph'd in a blow,
     As that which laid th' accomplish'd Burnet low.

     Thy form and mind, sweet maid, can I forget?
     In richest ore the brightest jewel set!
     In thee, high Heaven above was truest shown,
     As by His noblest work the Godhead best is known.

     In vain ye flaunt in summer's pride, ye groves;
     Thou crystal streamlet with thy flowery shore,
     Ye woodland choir that chaunt your idle loves,
     Ye cease to charm; Eliza is no more.

     Ye healthy wastes, immix'd with reedy fens;
     Ye mossy streams, with sedge and rushes stor'd:
     Ye rugged cliffs, o'erhanging dreary glens,
     To you I fly—ye with my soul accord.

     Princes, whose cumb'rous pride was all their worth,
     Shall venal lays their pompous exit hail,
     And thou, sweet Excellence! forsake our earth,
     And not a Muse with honest grief bewail?

     We saw thee shine in youth and beauty's pride,
     And Virtue's light, that beams beyond the spheres;
     But, like the sun eclips'd at morning tide,
     Thou left us darkling in a world of tears.

     The parent's heart that nestled fond in thee,
     That heart how sunk, a prey to grief and care;
     So deckt the woodbine sweet yon aged tree;
     So, from it ravish'd, leaves it bleak and bare.

      Lament Of Mary, Queen Of Scots, On The Approach Of Spring
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Now Nature hangs her mantle green
     On every blooming tree,
     And spreads her sheets o' daisies white
     Out o'er the grassy lea;
     Now Phoebus cheers the crystal streams,
     And glads the azure skies;
     But nought can glad the weary wight
     That fast in durance lies.

     Now laverocks wake the merry morn
     Aloft on dewy wing;
     The merle, in his noontide bow'r,
     Makes woodland echoes ring;
     The mavis wild wi' mony a note,
     Sings drowsy day to rest:
     In love and freedom they rejoice,
     Wi' care nor thrall opprest.

     Now blooms the lily by the bank,
     The primrose down the brae;
     The hawthorn's budding in the glen,
     And milk-white is the slae:
     The meanest hind in fair Scotland
     May rove their sweets amang;
     But I, the Queen of a' Scotland,
     Maun lie in prison strang.

     I was the Queen o' bonie France,
     Where happy I hae been;
     Fu' lightly raise I in the morn,
     As blythe lay down at e'en:
     And I'm the sov'reign of Scotland,
     And mony a traitor there;
     Yet here I lie in foreign bands,
     And never-ending care.

     But as for thee, thou false woman,
     My sister and my fae,
     Grim Vengeance yet shall whet a sword
     That thro' thy soul shall gae;
     The weeping blood in woman's breast
     Was never known to thee;
     Nor th' balm that draps on wounds of woe
     Frae woman's pitying e'e.

     My son! my son! may kinder stars
     Upon thy fortune shine;
     And may those pleasures gild thy reign,
     That ne'er wad blink on mine!
     God keep thee frae thy mother's faes,
     Or turn their hearts to thee:
     And where thou meet'st thy mother's friend,
     Remember him for me!

     O! soon, to me, may Summer suns
     Nae mair light up the morn!
     Nae mair to me the Autumn winds
     Wave o'er the yellow corn?
     And, in the narrow house of death,
     Let Winter round me rave;
     And the next flow'rs that deck the Spring,
     Bloom on my peaceful grave!

      Lament For James, Earl Of Glencairn
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     The wind blew hollow frae the hills,
     By fits the sun's departing beam
     Look'd on the fading yellow woods,
     That wav'd o'er Lugar's winding stream:
     Beneath a craigy steep, a Bard,
     Laden with years and meikle pain,
     In loud lament bewail'd his lord,
     Whom Death had all untimely ta'en.

     He lean'd him to an ancient aik,
     Whose trunk was mould'ring down with years;
     His locks were bleached white with time,
     His hoary cheek was wet wi' tears!
     And as he touch'd his trembling harp,
     And as he tun'd his doleful sang,
     The winds, lamenting thro' their caves,
     To Echo bore the notes alang.

     “Ye scatter'd birds that faintly sing,
     The reliques o' the vernal queir!
     Ye woods that shed on a' the winds
     The honours of the aged year!
     A few short months, and glad and gay,
     Again ye'll charm the ear and e'e;
     But nocht in all-revolving time
     Can gladness bring again to me.

     “I am a bending aged tree,
     That long has stood the wind and rain;
     But now has come a cruel blast,
     And my last hald of earth is gane;
     Nae leaf o' mine shall greet the spring,
     Nae simmer sun exalt my bloom;
     But I maun lie before the storm,
     And ithers plant them in my room.

     “I've seen sae mony changefu' years,
     On earth I am a stranger grown:
     I wander in the ways of men,
     Alike unknowing, and unknown:
     Unheard, unpitied, unreliev'd,
     I bear alane my lade o' care,
     For silent, low, on beds of dust,
     Lie a'
     hat would my sorrows share.

     “And last, (the sum of a' my griefs!)
     My noble master lies in clay;
     The flow'r amang our barons bold,
     His country's pride, his country's stay:
     In weary being now I pine,
     For a' the life of life is dead,
     And hope has left may aged ken,
     On forward wing for ever fled.

     “Awake thy last sad voice, my harp!
     The voice of woe and wild despair!
     Awake, resound thy latest lay,
     Then sleep in silence evermair!
     And thou, my last, best, only, friend,
     That fillest an untimely tomb,
     Accept this tribute from the Bard
     Thou brought from Fortune's mirkest gloom.

     “In Poverty's low barren vale,
     Thick mists obscure involv'd me round;
     Though oft I turn'd the wistful eye,
     Nae ray of fame was to be found:
     Thou found'st me, like the morning sun
     That melts the fogs in limpid air,
     The friendless bard and rustic song
     Became alike thy fostering care.

     “O! why has worth so short a date,
     While villains ripen grey with time?
     Must thou, the noble, gen'rous, great,
     Fall in bold manhood's hardy prim
     Why did I live to see that day—
     A day to me so full of woe?
     O! had I met the mortal shaft
     That laid my benefactor low!

     “The bridegroom may forget the bride
     Was made his wedded wife yestreen;
     The monarch may forget the crown
     That on his head an hour has been;
     The mother may forget the child
     That smiles sae sweetly on her knee;
     But I'll remember thee, Glencairn,
     And a' that thou hast done for me!”

     Wishfully I look and languish
     In that bonie face o' thine,

      Epigram On Miss Davies

    <h3>
      On being asked why she had been formed so little, and Mrs. A—so big.
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Ask why God made the gem so small?
     And why so huge the granite?—
     Because God meant mankind should set
     That higher value on it.

      The Charms Of Lovely Davies

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Tune—“Miss Muir.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     O how shall I, unskilfu', try
     The poet's occupation?
     The tunefu' powers, in happy hours,
     That whisper inspiration;
     Even they maun dare an effort mair
     Than aught they ever gave us,
     Ere they rehearse, in equal verse,
     The charms o' lovely Davies.

     Each eye it cheers when she appears,
     Like Phoebus in the morning,
     When past the shower, and every flower
     The garden is adorning:
     As the wretch looks o'er Siberia's shore,
     When winter-bound the wave is;
     Sae droops our heart, when we maun part
     Frae charming, lovely Davies.

     Her smile's a gift frae 'boon the lift,
     That maks us mair than princes;
     A sceptred hand, a king's command,
     Is in her darting glances;
     The man in arms 'gainst female charms
     Even he her willing slave is,
     He hugs his chain, and owns the reign
     Of conquering, lovely Davies.

     My Muse, to dream of such a theme,
     Her feeble powers surrender:
     The eagle's gaze alone surveys
     The sun's meridian splendour.
     I wad in vain essay the strain,
     The deed too daring brave is;
     I'll drap the lyre, and mute admire
     The charms o' lovely Davies.

    <h2>
      On Glenriddell's Fox Breaking His Chain
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     A Fragment, 1791.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Thou, Liberty, thou art my theme;
     Not such as idle poets dream,
     Who trick thee up a heathen goddess
     That a fantastic cap and rod has;
     Such stale conceits are poor and silly;
     I paint thee out, a Highland filly,
     A sturdy, stubborn, handsome dapple,
     As sleek's a mouse, as round's an apple,
     That when thou pleasest canst do wonders;
     But when thy luckless rider blunders,
     Or if thy fancy should demur there,
     Wilt break thy neck ere thou go further.

     These things premised, I sing a Fox,
     Was caught among his native rocks,
     And to a dirty kennel chained,
     How he his liberty regained.

     Glenriddell! Whig without a stain,
     A Whig in principle and grain,
     Could'st thou enslave a free-born creature,
     A native denizen of Nature?
     How could'st thou, with a heart so good,
     (A better ne'er was sluiced with blood!)
     Nail a poor devil to a tree,
     That ne'er did harm to thine or thee?

     The staunchest Whig Glenriddell was,
     Quite frantic in his country's cause;
     And oft was Reynard's prison passing,
     And with his brother-Whigs canvassing
     The Rights of Men, the Powers of Women,
     With all the dignity of Freemen.

     Sir Reynard daily heard debates
     Of Princes', Kings', and Nations' fates,
     With many rueful, bloody stories
     Of Tyrants, Jacobites, and Tories:
     From liberty how angels fell,
     That now are galley-slaves in hell;
     How Nimrod first the trade began
     Of binding Slavery's chains on Man;
     How fell Semiramis—God damn her!
     Did first, with sacrilegious hammer,
     (All ills till then were trivial matters)
     For Man dethron'd forge hen-peck fetters;

     How Xerxes, that abandoned Tory,
     Thought cutting throats was reaping glory,
     Until the stubborn Whigs of Sparta
     Taught him great Nature's Magna Charta;
     How mighty Rome her fiat hurl'd
     Resistless o'er a bowing world,
     And, kinder than they did desire,
     Polish'd mankind with sword and fire;
     With much, too tedious to relate,
     Of ancient and of modern date,
     But ending still, how Billy Pitt
     (Unlucky boy!) with wicked wit,
     Has gagg'd old Britain, drain'd her coffer,
     As butchers bind and bleed a heifer,

     Thus wily Reynard by degrees,
     In kennel listening at his ease,
     Suck'd in a mighty stock of knowledge,
     As much as some folks at a College;
     Knew Britain's rights and constitution,
     Her aggrandisement, diminution,
     How fortune wrought us good from evil;
     Let no man, then, despise the Devil,
     As who should say, 'I never can need him,'
     Since we to scoundrels owe our freedom.

      Poem On Pastoral Poetry
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Hail, Poesie! thou Nymph reserv'd!
     In chase o' thee, what crowds hae swerv'd
     Frae common sense, or sunk enerv'd
     'Mang heaps o' clavers:
     And och! o'er aft thy joes hae starv'd,
     'Mid a' thy favours!

     Say, Lassie, why, thy train amang,
     While loud the trump's heroic clang,
     And sock or buskin skelp alang
     To death or marriage;
     Scarce ane has tried the shepherd—sang
     But wi' miscarriage?

     In Homer's craft Jock Milton thrives;
     Eschylus' pen Will Shakespeare drives;
     Wee Pope, the knurlin', till him rives
     Horatian fame;
     In thy sweet sang, Barbauld, survives
     Even Sappho's flame.

     But thee, Theocritus, wha matches?
     They're no herd's ballats, Maro's catches;
     Squire Pope but busks his skinklin' patches
     O' heathen tatters:
     I pass by hunders, nameless wretches,
     That ape their betters.

     In this braw age o' wit and lear,
     Will nane the Shepherd's whistle mair
     Blaw sweetly in its native air,
     And rural grace;
     And, wi' the far-fam'd Grecian, share
     A rival place?

     Yes! there is ane—a Scottish callan!
     There's ane; come forrit, honest Allan!
     Thou need na jouk behint the hallan,
     A chiel sae clever;
     The teeth o' time may gnaw Tantallan,
     But thou's for ever.

     Thou paints auld Nature to the nines,
     In thy sweet Caledonian lines;
     Nae gowden stream thro' myrtle twines,
     Where Philomel,
     While nightly breezes sweep the vines,
     Her griefs will tell!

     In gowany glens thy burnie strays,
     Where bonie lasses bleach their claes,
     Or trots by hazelly shaws and braes,
     Wi' hawthorns gray,
     Where blackbirds join the shepherd's lays,
     At close o' day.

     Thy rural loves are Nature's sel';
     Nae bombast spates o' nonsense swell;
     Nae snap conceits, but that sweet spell
     O' witchin love,
     That charm that can the strongest quell,
     The sternest move.

      Verses On The Destruction Of The Woods Near Drumlanrig
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     As on the banks o' wandering Nith,
     Ae smiling simmer morn I stray'd,
     And traced its bonie howes and haughs,
     Where linties sang and lammies play'd,
     I sat me down upon a craig,
     And drank my fill o' fancy's dream,
     When from the eddying deep below,
     Up rose the genius of the stream.

     Dark, like the frowning rock, his brow,
     And troubled, like his wintry wave,
     And deep, as sughs the boding wind
     Amang his caves, the sigh he gave—
     “And come ye here, my son,” he cried,
     “To wander in my birken shade?
     To muse some favourite Scottish theme,
     Or sing some favourite Scottish maid?

     “There was a time, it's nae lang syne,
     Ye might hae seen me in my pride,
     When a' my banks sae bravely saw
     Their woody pictures in my tide;
     When hanging beech and spreading elm
     Shaded my stream sae clear and cool:
     And stately oaks their twisted arms
     Threw broad and dark across the pool;

     “When, glinting thro' the trees, appear'd
     The wee white cot aboon the mill,
     And peacefu' rose its ingle reek,
     That, slowly curling, clamb the hill.
     But now the cot is bare and cauld,
     Its leafy bield for ever gane,
     And scarce a stinted birk is left
     To shiver in the blast its lane.”

     “Alas!” quoth I, “what ruefu' chance
     Has twin'd ye o' your stately trees?
     Has laid your rocky bosom bare—
     Has stripped the cleeding o' your braes?
     Was it the bitter eastern blast,
     That scatters blight in early spring?
     Or was't the wil'fire scorch'd their boughs,
     Or canker-worm wi' secret sting?”

     “Nae eastlin blast,” the sprite replied;
     “It blaws na here sae fierce and fell,
     And on my dry and halesome banks
     Nae canker-worms get leave to dwell:
     Man! cruel man!” the genius sighed—
     As through the cliffs he sank him down—
     “The worm that gnaw'd my bonie trees,
     That reptile wears a ducal crown.”^1

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Health to the Maxwell's veteran Chief!
     Health, aye unsour'd by care or grief:
     Inspir'd, I turn'd Fate's sibyl leaf,
     This natal morn,
     I see thy life is stuff o' prief,
     Scarce quite half-worn.

     This day thou metes threescore eleven,
     And I can tell that bounteous Heaven
     (The second-sight, ye ken, is given
     To ilka Poet)
     On thee a tack o' seven times seven
     Will yet bestow it.

     If envious buckies view wi' sorrow
     Thy lengthen'd days on this blest morrow,
     May Desolation's lang-teeth'd harrow,
     Nine miles an hour,
     Rake them, like Sodom and Gomorrah,
     In brunstane stour.

     But for thy friends, and they are mony,
     Baith honest men, and lassies bonie,
     May couthie Fortune, kind and cannie,
     In social glee,
     Wi' mornings blythe, and e'enings funny,
     Bless them and thee!

     Fareweel, auld birkie! Lord be near ye,
     And then the deil, he daurna steer ye:
     Your friends aye love, your faes aye fear ye;
     For me, shame fa' me,
     If neist my heart I dinna wear ye,
     While Burns they ca' me.

      Second Epistle To Robert Graham, ESQ., Of Fintry
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     5th October 1791.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Late crippl'd of an arm, and now a leg,
     About to beg a pass for leave to beg;
     Dull, listless, teas'd, dejected, and deprest
     (Nature is adverse to a cripple's rest);
     Will generous Graham list to his Poet's wail?
     (It soothes poor Misery, hearkening to her tale)
     And hear him curse the light he first survey'd,
     And doubly curse the luckless rhyming trade?

     Thou, Nature! partial Nature, I arraign;
     Of thy caprice maternal I complain;
     The lion and the bull thy care have found,
     One shakes the forests, and one spurns the ground;
     Thou giv'st the ass his hide, the snail his shell;
     Th' envenom'd wasp, victorious, guards his cell;
     Thy minions kings defend, control, devour,
     In all th' omnipotence of rule and power;
     Foxes and statesmen subtile wiles ensure;
     The cit and polecat stink, and are secure;
     Toads with their poison, doctors with their drug,
     The priest and hedgehog in their robes, are snug;
     Ev'n silly woman has her warlike arts,
     Her tongue and eyes—her dreaded spear and darts.

     But Oh! thou bitter step-mother and hard,
     To thy poor, fenceless, naked child—the Bard!
     A thing unteachable in world's skill,
     And half an idiot too, more helpless still:
     No heels to bear him from the op'ning dun;
     No claws to dig, his hated sight to shun;
     No horns, but those by luckless Hymen worn,
     And those, alas! not, Amalthea's horn:
     No nerves olfact'ry, Mammon's trusty cur,
     Clad in rich Dulness' comfortable fur;
     In naked feeling, and in aching pride,
     He bears th' unbroken blast from ev'ry side:
     Vampyre booksellers drain him to the heart,
     And scorpion critics cureless venom dart.

     Critics—appall'd, I venture on the name;
     Those cut-throat bandits in the paths of fame:
     Bloody dissectors, worse than ten Monroes;
     He hacks to teach, they mangle to expose:

     His heart by causeless wanton malice wrung,
     By blockheads' daring into madness stung;
     His well-won bays, than life itself more dear,
     By miscreants torn, who ne'er one sprig must wear;
     Foil'd, bleeding, tortur'd in th' unequal strife,
     The hapless Poet flounders on thro' life:
     Till, fled each hope that once his bosom fir'd,
     And fled each muse that glorious once inspir'd,
     Low sunk in squalid, unprotected age,
     Dead even resentment for his injur'd page,
     He heeds or feels no more the ruthless critic's rage!

     So, by some hedge, the gen'rous steed deceas'd,
     For half-starv'd snarling curs a dainty feast;
     By toil and famine wore to skin and bone,
     Lies, senseless of each tugging bitch's son.

     O Dulness! portion of the truly blest!
     Calm shelter'd haven of eternal rest!
     Thy sons ne'er madden in the fierce extremes
     Of Fortune's polar frost, or torrid beams.
     If mantling high she fills the golden cup,
     With sober selfish ease they sip it up;
     Conscious the bounteous meed they well deserve,
     They only wonder “some folks” do not starve.
     The grave sage hern thus easy picks his frog,
     And thinks the mallard a sad worthless dog.
     When disappointments snaps the clue of hope,
     And thro' disastrous night they darkling grope,
     With deaf endurance sluggishly they bear,
     And just conclude that “fools are fortune's care.”
      So, heavy, passive to the tempest's shocks,
     Strong on the sign-post stands the stupid ox.

     Not so the idle Muses' mad-cap train,
     Not such the workings of their moon-struck brain;
     In equanimity they never dwell,
     By turns in soaring heav'n, or vaulted hell.

     I dread thee, Fate, relentless and severe,
     With all a poet's, husband's, father's fear!
     Already one strong hold of hope is lost—
     Glencairn, the truly noble, lies in dust
     (Fled, like the sun eclips'd as noon appears,
     And left us darkling in a world of tears);
     O! hear my ardent, grateful, selfish pray'r!
     Fintry, my other stay, long bless and spare!
     Thro' a long life his hopes and wishes crown,
     And bright in cloudless skies his sun go down!
     May bliss domestic smooth his private path;
     Give energy to life; and soothe his latest breath,
     With many a filial tear circling the bed of death!

     Let the blast sweep o'er the valley,
     See it prostrate in the clay.

     Hear the wood lark charm the forest,
     Telling o'er his little joys;
     But alas! a prey the surest
     To each pirate of the skies.

     Dearly bought the hidden treasure
     Finer feelings can bestow:
     Chords that vibrate sweetest pleasure
     Thrill the deepest notes of woe.

     “O help, maister, help, or she'll ruin us a'!”
      And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

     The Devil he swore by the edge o' his knife,
     Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
     He pitied the man that was tied to a wife,
     And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

     The Devil he swore by the kirk and the bell,
     Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
     He was not in wedlock, thank Heav'n, but in hell,
     And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

     Then Satan has travell'd again wi' his pack,
     Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
     And to her auld husband he's carried her back,
     And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

     I hae been a Devil the feck o' my life,
     Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
     “But ne'er was in hell till I met wi' a wife,”
      And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

    <h2>
      The Rights Of Woman
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     An Occasional Address.

     Spoken by Miss Fontenelle on her benefit night, November 26, 1792.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     While Europe's eye is fix'd on mighty things,
     The fate of Empires and the fall of Kings;
     While quacks of State must each produce his plan,
     And even children lisp the Rights of Man;
     Amid this mighty fuss just let me mention,
     The Rights of Woman merit some attention.

     First, in the Sexes' intermix'd connection,
     One sacred Right of Woman is, protection.—
     The tender flower that lifts its head, elate,
     Helpless, must fall before the blasts of Fate,
     Sunk on the earth, defac'd its lovely form,
     Unless your shelter ward th' impending storm.

     Our second Right—but needless here is caution,
     To keep that right inviolate's the fashion;
     Each man of sense has it so full before him,
     He'd die before he'd wrong it—'tis decorum.—
     There was, indeed, in far less polish'd days,
     A time, when rough rude man had naughty ways,
     Would swagger, swear, get drunk, kick up a riot,
     Nay even thus invade a Lady's quiet.

     Now, thank our stars! those Gothic times are fled;
     Now, well-bred men—and you are all well-bred—
     Most justly think (and we are much the gainers)
     Such conduct neither spirit, wit, nor manners.

     For Right the third, our last, our best, our dearest,
     That right to fluttering female hearts the nearest;
     Which even the Rights of Kings, in low prostration,
     Most humbly own—'tis dear, dear admiration!
     In that blest sphere alone we live and move;
     There taste that life of life—immortal love.
     Smiles, glances, sighs, tears, fits, flirtations, airs;
     'Gainst such an host what flinty savage dares,
     When awful Beauty joins with all her charms—
     Who is so rash as rise in rebel arms?

     But truce with kings, and truce with constitutions,
     With bloody armaments and revolutions;
     Let Majesty your first attention summon,
     Ah! ca ira! The Majesty Of Woman!

      On the Duke of Brunswick's Breaking up his Camp, and the defeat of the
      Austrians, by Dumourier, November 1792.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     When Princes and Prelates,
     And hot-headed zealots,
     A'Europe had set in a low, a low,
     The poor man lies down,
     Nor envies a crown,
     And comforts himself as he dow, as he dow,
     And comforts himself as he dow.

     The black-headed eagle,
     As keen as a beagle,
     He hunted o'er height and o'er howe,
     In the braes o' Gemappe,
     He fell in a trap,
     E'en let him come out as he dow, dow, dow,
     E'en let him come out as he dow.

     But truce with commotions,
     And new-fangled notions,
     A bumper, I trust you'll allow;
     Here's George our good king,
     And Charlotte his queen,
     And lang may they ring as they dow, dow, dow,

      The Soldier's Return
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Air—“The Mill, mill, O.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     When wild war's deadly blast was blawn,
     And gentle peace returning,
     Wi' mony a sweet babe fatherless,
     And mony a widow mourning;
     I left the lines and tented field,
     Where lang I'd been a lodger,
     My humble knapsack a' my wealth,
     A poor and honest sodger.

     A leal, light heart was in my breast,
     My hand unstain'd wi' plunder;
     And for fair Scotia hame again,
     I cheery on did wander:
     I thought upon the banks o' Coil,
     I thought upon my Nancy,
     I thought upon the witching smile
     That caught my youthful fancy.

     At length I reach'd the bonie glen,
     Where early life I sported;
     I pass'd the mill and trysting thorn,
     Where Nancy aft I courted:
     Wha spied I but my ain dear maid,
     Down by her mother's dwelling!
     And turn'd me round to hide the flood
     That in my een was swelling.

     Wi' alter'd voice, quoth I, “Sweet lass,
     Sweet as yon hawthorn's blossom,
     O! happy, happy may he be,
     That's dearest to thy bosom:
     My purse is light, I've far to gang,
     And fain would be thy lodger;
     I've serv'd my king and country lang—
     Take pity on a sodger.”

     Sae wistfully she gaz'd on me,
     And lovelier was than ever;
     Quo' she, “A sodger ance I lo'ed,
     Forget him shall I never:
     Our humble cot, and hamely fare,
     Ye freely shall partake it;
     That gallant badge—the dear cockade,
     Ye're welcome for the sake o't.”

     She gaz'd—she redden'd like a rose—
     Syne pale like only lily;
     She sank within my arms, and cried,
     “Art thou my ain dear Willie?”
      “By him who made yon sun and sky!
     By whom true love's regarded,
     I am the man; and thus may still
     True lovers be rewarded.

     “The wars are o'er, and I'm come hame,
     And find thee still true-hearted;
     Tho' poor in gear, we're rich in love,
     And mair we'se ne'er be parted.”
      Quo' she, “My grandsire left me gowd,
     A mailen plenish'd fairly;
     And come, my faithfu' sodger lad,
     Thou'rt welcome to it dearly!”

     For gold the merchant ploughs the main,
     The farmer ploughs the manor;
     But glory is the sodger's prize,

      Bonie Jean—A Ballad
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     To its ain tune.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     There was a lass, and she was fair,
     At kirk or market to be seen;
     When a' our fairest maids were met,
     The fairest maid was bonie Jean.

     And aye she wrought her mammie's wark,
     And aye she sang sae merrilie;
     The blythest bird upon the bush
     Had ne'er a lighter heart than she.

     But hawks will rob the tender joys
     That bless the little lintwhite's nest;
     And frost will blight the fairest flowers,
     And love will break the soundest rest.

     Young Robie was the brawest lad,
     The flower and pride of a' the glen;
     And he had owsen, sheep, and kye,
     And wanton naigies nine or ten.

     He gaed wi' Jeanie to the tryste,
     He danc'd wi' Jeanie on the down;
     And, lang ere witless Jeanie wist,
     Her heart was tint, her peace was stown!

     As in the bosom of the stream,
     The moon-beam dwells at dewy e'en;
     So trembling, pure, was tender love
     Within the breast of bonie Jean.

     And now she works her mammie's wark,
     And aye she sighs wi' care and pain;
     Yet wist na what her ail might be,
     Or what wad make her weel again.

     But did na Jeanie's heart loup light,
     And didna joy blink in her e'e,
     As Robie tauld a tale o' love
     Ae e'ening on the lily lea?

     The sun was sinking in the west,
     The birds sang sweet in ilka grove;
     His cheek to hers he fondly laid,
     And whisper'd thus his tale o' love:

     “O Jeanie fair, I lo'e thee dear;
     O canst thou think to fancy me,
     Or wilt thou leave thy mammie's cot,
     And learn to tent the farms wi' me?

     “At barn or byre thou shalt na drudge,
     Or naething else to trouble thee;
     But stray amang the heather-bells,
     And tent the waving corn wi' me.”

     Now what could artless Jeanie do?
     She had nae will to say him na:
     At length she blush'd a sweet consent,
     And love was aye between them twa.

     But can they melt the glowing heart,
     Or chain the soul in speechless pleasure?
     Or thro' each nerve the rapture dart,
     Like meeting her, our bosom's treasure?

     O whistle, an' I'll come to ye, my lad.

 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Adown winding Nith I did wander,
     To mark the sweet flowers as they spring;
     Adown winding Nith I did wander,

     Chorus.—Awa' wi' your belles and your beauties,
     They never wi' her can compare,
     Whaever has met wi' my Phillis,
     Has met wi' the queen o' the fair.

     The daisy amus'd my fond fancy,
     So artless, so simple, so wild;
     Thou emblem, said I, o' my Phillis—
     For she is Simplicity's child.
     Awa' wi' your belles, &amp;c.

     The rose-bud's the blush o' my charmer,
     Her sweet balmy lip when 'tis prest:
     How fair and how pure is the lily!
     But fairer and purer her breast.
     Awa' wi' your belles, &amp;c.

     Yon knot of gay flowers in the arbour,
     They ne'er wi' my Phillis can vie:
     Her breath is the breath of the woodbine,
     Its dew-drop o' diamond her eye.
     Awa' wi' your belles, &amp;c.

     Her voice is the song o' the morning,
     That wakes thro' the green-spreading grove
     When Phoebus peeps over the mountains,
     On music, and pleasure, and love.
     Awa' wi' your belles, &amp;c.

     But beauty, how frail and how fleeting!
     The bloom of a fine summer's day;
     While worth in the mind o' my Phillis,
     Will flourish without a decay.
     Awa' wi' your belles, &amp;c.

     Yet long, long, too well have I known;
     All that has caused this wreck in my bosom,

      Address
    </h2>
    <p>
      Spoken by Miss Fontenelle on her Benefit Night, December 4th, 1793, at the
      Theatre, Dumfries.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Still anxious to secure your partial favour,
     And not less anxious, sure, this night, than ever,
     A Prologue, Epilogue, or some such matter,
     'Twould vamp my bill, said I, if nothing better;
     So sought a poet, roosted near the skies,
     Told him I came to feast my curious eyes;
     Said, nothing like his works was ever printed;
     And last, my prologue-business slily hinted.
     “Ma'am, let me tell you,” quoth my man of rhymes,
     “I know your bent—these are no laughing times:
     Can you—but, Miss, I own I have my fears—
     Dissolve in pause, and sentimental tears;
     With laden sighs, and solemn-rounded sentence,
     Rouse from his sluggish slumbers, fell Repentance;
     Paint Vengeance as he takes his horrid stand,
     Waving on high the desolating brand,
     Calling the storms to bear him o'er a guilty land?”

     I could no more—askance the creature eyeing,
     “D'ye think,” said I, “this face was made for crying?
     I'll laugh, that's poz-nay more, the world shall know it;
     And so, your servant! gloomy Master Poet!”

     Firm as my creed, Sirs, 'tis my fix'd belief,
     That Misery's another word for Grief:
     I also think—so may I be a bride!
     That so much laughter, so much life enjoy'd.

     Thou man of crazy care and ceaseless sigh,
     Still under bleak Misfortune's blasting eye;
     Doom'd to that sorest task of man alive—
     To make three guineas do the work of five:
     Laugh in Misfortune's face—the beldam witch!
     Say, you'll be merry, tho' you can't be rich.

     Thou other man of care, the wretch in love,
     Who long with jiltish airs and arts hast strove;
     Who, as the boughs all temptingly project,
     Measur'st in desperate thought—a rope—thy neck—
     Or, where the beetling cliff o'erhangs the deep,
     Peerest to meditate the healing leap:
     Would'st thou be cur'd, thou silly, moping elf?
     Laugh at her follies—laugh e'en at thyself:
     Learn to despise those frowns now so terrific,
     And love a kinder—that's your grand specific.

     To sum up all, be merry, I advise;
     And as we're merry, may we still be wise.

     Where the wa'flow'r scents the dery air,
     Where the howlet mourns in her ivy bower,
     And tells the midnight moon her care.

     Chorus—A lassie all alone, was making her moan,
     Lamenting our lads beyond the sea:
     In the bluidy wars they fa', and our honour's gane an' a',
     And broken-hearted we maun die.

     The winds were laid, the air was till,
     The stars they shot along the sky;
     The tod was howling on the hill,
     And the distant-echoing glens reply.
     A lassie all alone, &amp;c.

     The burn, adown its hazelly path,
     Was rushing by the ruin'd wa',
     Hasting to join the sweeping Nith,
     Whase roarings seem'd to rise and fa'.
     A lassie all alone, &amp;c.

     The cauld blae North was streaming forth
     Her lights, wi' hissing, eerie din,
     Athort the lift they start and shift,
     Like Fortune's favours, tint as win.
     A lassie all alone, &amp;c.

     Now, looking over firth and fauld,
     Her horn the pale-faced Cynthia rear'd,
     When lo! in form of Minstrel auld,
     A stern and stalwart ghaist appear'd.
     A lassie all alone, &amp;c.

     And frae his harp sic strains did flow,
     Might rous'd the slumbering Dead to hear;
     But oh, it was a tale of woe,
     As ever met a Briton's ear!
     A lassie all alone, &amp;c.

     He sang wi' joy his former day,
     He, weeping, wail'd his latter times;
     But what he said—it was nae play,
     I winna venture't in my rhymes.

      Epistle From Esopus To Maria
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     From those drear solitudes and frowsy cells,
     Where Infamy with sad Repentance dwells;
     Where turnkeys make the jealous portal fast,
     And deal from iron hands the spare repast;
     Where truant 'prentices, yet young in sin,
     Blush at the curious stranger peeping in;
     Where strumpets, relics of the drunken roar,
     Resolve to drink, nay, half, to whore, no more;
     Where tiny thieves not destin'd yet to swing,
     Beat hemp for others, riper for the string:
     From these dire scenes my wretched lines I date,
     To tell Maria her Esopus' fate.

     “Alas! I feel I am no actor here!”
      'Tis real hangmen real scourges bear!
     Prepare Maria, for a horrid tale
     Will turn thy very rouge to deadly pale;
     Will make thy hair, tho' erst from gipsy poll'd,
     By barber woven, and by barber sold,
     Though twisted smooth with Harry's nicest care,
     Like hoary bristles to erect and stare.
     The hero of the mimic scene, no more
     I start in Hamlet, in Othello roar;
     Or, haughty Chieftain, 'mid the din of arms
     In Highland Bonnet, woo Malvina's charms;
     While sans-culottes stoop up the mountain high,
     And steal from me Maria's prying eye.
     Blest Highland bonnet! once my proudest dress,
     Now prouder still, Maria's temples press;
     I see her wave thy towering plumes afar,
     And call each coxcomb to the wordy war:
     I see her face the first of Ireland's sons,
     And even out-Irish his Hibernian bronze;
     The crafty Colonel leaves the tartan'd lines,
     For other wars, where he a hero shines:
     The hopeful youth, in Scottish senate bred,
     Who owns a Bushby's heart without the head,
     Comes 'mid a string of coxcombs, to display
     That veni, vidi, vici, is his way:
     The shrinking Bard adown the alley skulks,
     And dreads a meeting worse than Woolwich hulks:
     Though there, his heresies in Church and State
     Might well award him Muir and Palmer's fate:
     Still she undaunted reels and rattles on,
     And dares the public like a noontide sun.
     What scandal called Maria's jaunty stagger
     The ricket reeling of a crooked swagger?
     Whose spleen (e'en worse than Burns' venom, when
     He dips in gall unmix'd his eager pen,
     And pours his vengeance in the burning line,)—
     Who christen'd thus Maria's lyre-divine
     The idiot strum of Vanity bemus'd,
     And even the abuse of Poesy abus'd?—
     Who called her verse a Parish Workhouse, made
     For motley foundling Fancies, stolen or strayed?

     A Workhouse! ah, that sound awakes my woes,
     And pillows on the thorn my rack'd repose!
     In durance vile here must I wake and weep,
     And all my frowsy couch in sorrow steep;
     That straw where many a rogue has lain of yore,
     And vermin'd gipsies litter'd heretofore.

     Why, Lonsdale, thus thy wrath on vagrants pour?
     Must earth no rascal save thyself endure?
     Must thou alone in guilt immortal swell,
     And make a vast monopoly of hell?
     Thou know'st the Virtues cannot hate thee worse;
     The Vices also, must they club their curse?
     Or must no tiny sin to others fall,
     Because thy guilt's supreme enough for all?

     Maria, send me too thy griefs and cares;
     In all of thee sure thy Esopus shares.
     As thou at all mankind the flag unfurls,
     Who on my fair one Satire's vengeance hurls—
     Who calls thee, pert, affected, vain coquette,
     A wit in folly, and a fool in wit!
     Who says that fool alone is not thy due,
     And quotes thy treacheries to prove it true!

     Our force united on thy foes we'll turn,
     And dare the war with all of woman born:
     For who can write and speak as thou and I?
     My periods that deciphering defy,
     And thy still matchless tongue that conquers all reply!

      The Highland Widow's Lament
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Oh I am come to the low Countrie,
     Ochon, Ochon, Ochrie!
     Without a penny in my purse,
     To buy a meal to me.

     It was na sae in the Highland hills,
     Ochon, Ochon, Ochrie!
     Nae woman in the Country wide,
     Sae happy was as me.

     For then I had a score o'kye,
     Ochon, Ochon, Ochrie!
     Feeding on you hill sae high,
     And giving milk to me.

     And there I had three score o'yowes,
     Ochon, Ochon, Ochrie!
     Skipping on yon bonie knowes,
     And casting woo' to me.

     I was the happiest of a' the Clan,
     Sair, sair, may I repine;
     For Donald was the brawest man,
     And Donald he was mine.

     Till Charlie Stewart cam at last,
     Sae far to set us free;
     My Donald's arm was wanted then,
     For Scotland and for me.

     Their waefu' fate what need I tell,
     Right to the wrang did yield;
     My Donald and his Country fell,
     Upon Culloden field.

     Oh I am come to the low Countrie,
     Ochon, Ochon, Ochrie!
     Nae woman in the warld wide,
     Sae wretched now as me.

    <h2>
      Ode For General Washington's Birthday
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     No Spartan tube, no Attic shell,
     No lyre Aeolian I awake;
     'Tis liberty's bold note I swell,
     Thy harp, Columbia, let me take!
     See gathering thousands, while I sing,
     A broken chain exulting bring,
     And dash it in a tyrant's face,
     And dare him to his very beard,
     And tell him he no more is feared—
     No more the despot of Columbia's race!
     A tyrant's proudest insults brav'd,
     They shout—a People freed! They hail an Empire saved.
     Where is man's god-like form?
     Where is that brow erect and bold—
     That eye that can unmov'd behold
     The wildest rage, the loudest storm
     That e'er created fury dared to raise?
     Avaunt! thou caitiff, servile, base,
     That tremblest at a despot's nod,
     Yet, crouching under the iron rod,
     Canst laud the hand that struck th' insulting blow!
     Art thou of man's Imperial line?
     Dost boast that countenance divine?
     Each skulking feature answers, No!
     But come, ye sons of Liberty,
     Columbia's offspring, brave as free,
     In danger's hour still flaming in the van,
     Ye know, and dare maintain, the Royalty of Man!

     Alfred! on thy starry throne,
     Surrounded by the tuneful choir,
     The bards that erst have struck the patriot lyre,
     And rous'd the freeborn Briton's soul of fire,
     No more thy England own!
     Dare injured nations form the great design,
     To make detested tyrants bleed?
     Thy England execrates the glorious deed!
     Beneath her hostile banners waving,
     Every pang of honour braving,
     England in thunder calls, “The tyrant's cause is mine!”
      That hour accurst how did the fiends rejoice
     And hell, thro' all her confines, raise the exulting voice,
     That hour which saw the generous English name
     Linkt with such damned deeds of everlasting shame!

     Thee, Caledonia! thy wild heaths among,
     Fam'd for the martial deed, the heaven-taught song,
     To thee I turn with swimming eyes;
     Where is that soul of Freedom fled?
     Immingled with the mighty dead,
     Beneath that hallow'd turf where Wallace lies
     Hear it not, Wallace! in thy bed of death.
     Ye babbling winds! in silence sweep,
     Disturb not ye the hero's sleep,
     Nor give the coward secret breath!
     Is this the ancient Caledonian form,
     Firm as the rock, resistless as the storm?
     Show me that eye which shot immortal hate,
     Blasting the despot's proudest bearing;
     Show me that arm which, nerv'd with thundering fate,
     Crush'd Usurpation's boldest daring!—
     Dark-quench'd as yonder sinking star,
     No more that glance lightens afar;
     That palsied arm no more whirls on the waste of war.

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Here, where the Scottish Muse immortal lives,
     In sacred strains and tuneful numbers joined,
     Accept the gift; though humble he who gives,
     Rich is the tribute of the grateful mind.

     So may no ruffian-feeling in my breast,

     But Peace attune thy gentle soul to rest,
     Or Love, ecstatic, wake his seraph song,

      On The Seas And Far Away
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Tune—“O'er the hills and far away.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     How can my poor heart be glad,
     When absent from my sailor lad;
     How can I the thought forego—
     He's on the seas to meet the foe?
     Let me wander, let me rove,
     Still my heart is with my love;
     Nightly dreams, and thoughts by day,
     Are with him that's far away.

     Chorus.—On the seas and far away,
     On stormy seas and far away;
     Nightly dreams and thoughts by day,
     Are aye with him that's far away.

     When in summer noon I faint,
     As weary flocks around me pant,
     Haply in this scorching sun,
     My sailor's thund'ring at his gun;
     Bullets, spare my only joy!
     Bullets, spare my darling boy!
     Fate, do with me what you may,
     Spare but him that's far away,
     On the seas and far away,
     On stormy seas and far away;
     Fate, do with me what you may,
     Spare but him that's far away.

     At the starless, midnight hour
     When Winter rules with boundless power,
     As the storms the forests tear,
     And thunders rend the howling air,
     Listening to the doubling roar,
     Surging on the rocky shore,
     All I can—I weep and pray
     For his weal that's far away,
     On the seas and far away,
     On stormy seas and far away;
     All I can—I weep and pray,
     For his weal that's far away.

     Peace, thy olive wand extend,
     And bid wild War his ravage end,
     Man with brother Man to meet,
     And as a brother kindly greet;
     Then may heav'n with prosperous gales,
     Fill my sailor's welcome sails;
     To my arms their charge convey,
     My dear lad that's far away.
     On the seas and far away,
     On stormy seas and far away;
     To my arms their charge convey,
     My dear lad that's far away.

     Altho' I love my Chloris mair
     Than ever tongue could tell;
     My passion I will ne'er declare—
     I'll say, I wish thee well.

     Tho' a' my daily care thou art,
     And a' my nightly dream,
     I'll hide the struggle in my heart,
     And say it is esteem.

     And by thy charms, my Philly.

          She. O Willy, aye I bless the grove
     Where first I own'd my maiden love,
     Whilst thou did pledge the Powers above,
     To be my ain dear Willy.

          Both. For a' the joys that gowd can gie,
     I dinna care a single flie;
     The lad I love's the lad for me,
     The lass I love's the lass for me,
     And that's my ain dear Willy.
     And that's my ain dear Philly.

          He. As songsters of the early year,
     Are ilka day mair sweet to hear,
     So ilka day to me mair dear
     And charming is my Philly.

          She. As on the brier the budding rose,
     Still richer breathes and fairer blows,
     So in my tender bosom grows
     The love I bear my Willy.

          Both. For a' the joys, &amp;c.

          He. The milder sun and bluer sky
     That crown my harvest cares wi' joy,
     Were ne'er sae welcome to my eye
     As is a sight o' Philly.

          She. The little swallow's wanton wing,
     Tho' wafting o'er the flowery Spring,
     Did ne'er to me sic tidings bring,
     As meeting o' my Willy.
     Both. For a' the joys, &amp;c.

          He. The bee that thro' the sunny hour
     Sips nectar in the op'ning flower,
     Compar'd wi' my delight is poor,
     Upon the lips o' Philly.

          She. The woodbine in the dewy weet,
     When ev'ning shades in silence meet,
     Is nocht sae fragrant or sae sweet
     As is a kiss o' Willy.

          Both. For a' the joys, &amp;c.

          He. Let fortune's wheel at random rin,
     And fools may tine and knaves may win;
     My thoughts are a' bound up in ane,
     And that's my ain dear Philly.

          She. What's a' the joys that gowd can gie?
     I dinna care a single flie;
     The lad I love's the lad for me,
     And that's my ain dear Willy.

     Tho' hundreds worship at his word,
     He's but a coof for a' that:
     For a' that, an' a' that,
     His ribband, star, an' a' that:
     The man o' independent mind
     He looks an' laughs at a' that.

     A prince can mak a belted knight,
     A marquis, duke, an' a' that;
     But an honest man's abon his might,
     Gude faith, he maunna fa' that!
     For a' that, an' a' that,
     Their dignities an' a' that;
     The pith o' sense, an' pride o' worth,
     Are higher rank than a' that.

     Then let us pray that come it may,
     (As come it will for a' that,)
     That Sense and Worth, o'er a' the earth,
     Shall bear the gree, an' a' that.
     For a' that, an' a' that,
     It's coming yet for a' that,
     That Man to Man, the world o'er,
     Shall brothers be for a' that.

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Sweet fa's the eve on Craigieburn,
     And blythe awakes the morrow;
     But a' the pride o' Spring's return
     Can yield me nocht but sorrow.

     I see the flowers and spreading trees,
     I hear the wild birds singing;
     But what a weary wight can please,
     And Care his bosom wringing!

     Fain, fain would I my griefs impart,
     Yet dare na for your anger;
     But secret love will break my heart,
     If I conceal it langer.

     If thou refuse to pity me,
     If thou shalt love another,
     When yon green leaves fade frae the tree,
     Around my grave they'll wither.

     Whom will you send to London town,

     Or wha in a' the country round
     The best deserves to fa' that?
     For a' that, and a' that,
     Thro' Galloway and a' that,
     Where is the Laird or belted Knight
     The best deserves to fa' that?

     Wha sees Kerroughtree's open yett,
     (And wha is't never saw that?)
     Wha ever wi' Kerroughtree met,
     And has a doubt of a' that?
     For a' that, and a' that,
     Here's Heron yet for a' that!
     The independent patriot,
     The honest man, and a' that.

     Tho' wit and worth, in either sex,
     Saint Mary's Isle can shaw that,
     Wi' Dukes and Lords let Selkirk mix,
     And weel does Selkirk fa' that.
     For a' that, and a' that,
     Here's Heron yet for a' that!
     The independent commoner
     Shall be the man for a' that.

     But why should we to Nobles jouk,
     And is't against the law, that?
     For why, a Lord may be a gowk,
     Wi' ribband, star and a' that,
     For a' that, and a' that,
     Here's Heron yet for a' that!
     A Lord may be a lousy loun,
     Wi' ribband, star and a' that.

     A beardless boy comes o'er the hills,
     Wi' uncle's purse and a' that;
     But we'll hae ane frae mang oursels,
     A man we ken, and a' that.
     For a' that, and a' that,
     Here's Heron yet for a' that!
     For we're not to be bought and sold,
     Like naigs, and nowt, and a' that.

     Then let us drink—The Stewartry,
     Kerroughtree's laird, and a' that,
     Our representative to be,
     For weel he's worthy a' that.
     For a' that, and a' that,
     Here's Heron yet for a' that!
     A House of Commons such as he,

     And there will be black-nebbit Johnie,
     The tongue o' the trump to them a';
     An he get na Hell for his haddin',
     The Deil gets na justice ava.

     And there will be Kempleton's birkie,
     A boy no sae black at the bane;
     But as to his fine Nabob fortune,
     We'll e'en let the subject alane.

     And there will be Wigton's new Sheriff;
     Dame Justice fu' brawly has sped,
     She's gotten the heart of a Bushby,
     But, Lord! what's become o' the head?
     And there will be Cardoness, Esquire,
     Sae mighty in Cardoness' eyes;
     A wight that will weather damnation,
     The Devil the prey will despise.

     And there will be Douglasses doughty,
     New christening towns far and near;
     Abjuring their democrat doings,
     By kissin' the-o' a Peer:
     And there will be folk frae Saint Mary's
     A house o' great merit and note;
     The deil ane but honours them highly—
     The deil ane will gie them his vote!

     And there will be Kenmure sae gen'rous,
     Whose honour is proof to the storm,
     To save them from stark reprobation,
     He lent them his name in the Firm.
     And there will be lads o' the gospel,
     Muirhead wha's as gude as he's true;
     And there will be Buittle's Apostle,
     Wha's mair o' the black than the blue.

     And there will be Logan M'Dowall,
     Sculdudd'ry an' he will be there,
     And also the Wild Scot o' Galloway,
     Sogering, gunpowder Blair.
     But we winna mention Redcastle,
     The body, e'en let him escape!
     He'd venture the gallows for siller,
     An 'twere na the cost o' the rape.

     But where is the Doggerbank hero,
     That made “Hogan Mogan” to skulk?
     Poor Keith's gane to hell to be fuel,
     The auld rotten wreck of a Hulk.
     And where is our King's Lord Lieutenant,
     Sae fam'd for his gratefu' return?
     The birkie is gettin' his Questions
     To say in Saint Stephen's the morn.

     But mark ye! there's trusty Kerroughtree,
     Whose honor was ever his law;
     If the Virtues were pack'd in a parcel,
     His worth might be sample for a';
     And strang an' respectfu's his backing,
     The maist o' the lairds wi' him stand;
     Nae gipsy-like nominal barons,
     Wha's property's paper—not land.

     And there, frae the Niddisdale borders,
     The Maxwells will gather in droves,
     Teugh Jockie, staunch Geordie, an' Wellwood,
     That griens for the fishes and loaves;
     And there will be Heron, the Major,
     Wha'll ne'er be forgot in the Greys;
     Our flatt'ry we'll keep for some other,
     Him, only it's justice to praise.

     And there will be maiden Kilkerran,
     And also Barskimming's gude Knight,
     And there will be roarin Birtwhistle,
     Yet luckily roars i' the right.
     And there'll be Stamp Office Johnie,
     (Tak tent how ye purchase a dram!)
     And there will be gay Cassencarry,
     And there'll be gleg Colonel Tam.

     And there'll be wealthy young Richard,
     Dame Fortune should hing by the neck,
     For prodigal, thriftless bestowing—
     His merit had won him respect.

     And there will be rich brother nabobs,
     (Tho' Nabobs, yet men not the worst,)
     And there will be Collieston's whiskers,
     And Quintin—a lad o' the first.

     Then hey! the chaste Interest o' Broughton
     And hey! for the blessin's 'twill bring;
     It may send Balmaghie to the Commons,
     In Sodom 'twould make him a king;
     And hey! for the sanctified Murray,
     Our land wha wi' chapels has stor'd;
     He founder'd his horse among harlots,
     But gied the auld naig to the Lord.

<pre xml:space="preserve">     Ballad Third

     John Bushby's Lamentation.

     Tune—“Babes in the Wood.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     'Twas in the seventeen hunder year
     O' grace, and ninety-five,
     That year I was the wae'est man
     Of ony man alive.

     In March the three-an'-twentieth morn,
     The sun raise clear an' bright;
     But oh! I was a waefu' man,
     Ere to-fa' o' the night.

     Yerl Galloway lang did rule this land,
     Wi' equal right and fame,
     And thereto was his kinsmen join'd,
     The Murray's noble name.

     Yerl Galloway's man o' men was I,
     And chief o' Broughton's host;
     So twa blind beggars, on a string,
     The faithfu' tyke will trust.

     But now Yerl Galloway's sceptre's broke,
     And Broughton's wi' the slain,
     And I my ancient craft may try,
     Sin' honesty is gane.

     'Twas by the banks o' bonie Dee,
     Beside Kirkcudbright's towers,
     The Stewart and the Murray there,
     Did muster a' their powers.

     Then Murray on the auld grey yaud,
     Wi' winged spurs did ride,
     That auld grey yaud a' Nidsdale rade,
     He staw upon Nidside.

     And there had na been the Yerl himsel,
     O there had been nae play;
     But Garlies was to London gane,
     And sae the kye might stray.

     And there was Balmaghie, I ween,
     In front rank he wad shine;
     But Balmaghie had better been
     Drinkin' Madeira wine.

     And frae Glenkens cam to our aid
     A chief o' doughty deed;
     In case that worth should wanted be,
     O' Kenmure we had need.

     And by our banners march'd Muirhead,
     And Buittle was na slack;
     Whase haly priesthood nane could stain,
     For wha could dye the black?

     And there was grave squire Cardoness,
     Look'd on till a' was done;
     Sae in the tower o' Cardoness
     A howlet sits at noon.

     And there led I the Bushby clan,
     My gamesome billie, Will,
     And my son Maitland, wise as brave,
     My footsteps follow'd still.

     The Douglas and the Heron's name,
     We set nought to their score;
     The Douglas and the Heron's name,
     Had felt our weight before.

     But Douglasses o' weight had we,
     The pair o' lusty lairds,
     For building cot-houses sae fam'd,
     And christenin' kail-yards.

     And there Redcastle drew his sword,
     That ne'er was stain'd wi' gore,
     Save on a wand'rer lame and blind,
     To drive him frae his door.

     And last cam creepin' Collieston,
     Was mair in fear than wrath;
     Ae knave was constant in his mind—
     To keep that knave frae scaith.

      The Lass That Made The Bed To Me
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     When Januar' wind was blawing cauld,
     As to the north I took my way,
     The mirksome night did me enfauld,
     I knew na where to lodge till day:

     By my gude luck a maid I met,
     Just in the middle o' my care,
     And kindly she did me invite
     To walk into a chamber fair.

     I bow'd fu' low unto this maid,
     And thank'd her for her courtesie;
     I bow'd fu' low unto this maid,
     An' bade her make a bed to me;

     She made the bed baith large and wide,
     Wi' twa white hands she spread it doun;
     She put the cup to her rosy lips,
     And drank—“Young man, now sleep ye soun'.”

     Chorus—The bonie lass made the bed to me,
     The braw lass made the bed to me,
     I'll ne'er forget till the day I die,
     The lass that made the bed to me.

     She snatch'd the candle in her hand,
     And frae my chamber went wi' speed;
     But I call'd her quickly back again,
     To lay some mair below my head:

     A cod she laid below my head,
     And served me with due respect,
     And, to salute her wi' a kiss,
     I put my arms about her neck.
     The bonie lass, &amp;c.

     “Haud aff your hands, young man!” she said,
     “And dinna sae uncivil be;
     Gif ye hae ony luve for me,
     O wrang na my virginitie.”
      Her hair was like the links o' gowd,
     Her teeth were like the ivorie,
     Her cheeks like lilies dipt in wine,
     The lass that made the bed to me:
     The bonie lass, &amp;c.

     Her bosom was the driven snaw,
     Twa drifted heaps sae fair to see;
     Her limbs the polish'd marble stane,
     The lass that made the bed to me.
     I kiss'd her o'er and o'er again,
     And aye she wist na what to say:
     I laid her 'tween me and the wa';
     The lassie thocht na lang till day.
     The bonie lass, &amp;c.

     Upon the morrow when we raise,
     I thank'd her for her courtesie;
     But aye she blush'd and aye she sigh'd,
     And said, “Alas, ye've ruin'd me.”
      I claps'd her waist, and kiss'd her syne,
     While the tear stood twinkling in her e'e;
     I said, my lassie, dinna cry.
     For ye aye shall make the bed to me.
     The bonie lass, &amp;c.

     She took her mither's holland sheets,
     An' made them a' in sarks to me;
     Blythe and merry may she be,
     The lass that made the bed to me.

     Chorus—The bonie lass made the bed to me,
     The braw lass made the bed to me.
     I'll ne'er forget till the day I die,
     The lass that made the bed to me.

     And when I wadna venture in,
     A coward loon she ca'd me:
     Had Kirk an' State been in the gate,
     I'd lighted when she bade me.

     Sae craftilie she took me ben,
     And bade me mak nae clatter;
     “For our ramgunshoch, glum gudeman

     Whae'er shall say I wanted grace,

     Could I for shame, could I for shame,

     Far dearer to me are yon humble broom bowers
     Where the blue-bell and gowan lurk, lowly, unseen;
     For there, lightly tripping, among the wild flowers,
     A-list'ning the linnet, aft wanders my Jean.

     Tho' rich is the breeze in their gay, sunny valleys,
     And cauld Caledonia's blast on the wave;
     Their sweet-scented woodlands that skirt the proud palace,
     What are they?—the haunt of the Tyrant and Slave.
     The Slave's spicy forests, and gold-bubbling fountains,
     The brave Caledonian views wi' disdain;

     And sair wi' his love he did deave me;
     I said, there was naething I hated like men—
     The deuce gae wi'm, to believe me, believe me;
     The deuce gae wi'm to believe me.

     He spak o' the darts in my bonie black e'en,
     And vow'd for my love he was diein,
     I said, he might die when he liked for Jean—
     The Lord forgie me for liein, for liein;
     The Lord forgie me for liein!

     A weel-stocked mailen, himsel' for the laird,
     And marriage aff-hand, were his proffers;
     I never loot on that I kenn'd it, or car'd;
     But thought I might hae waur offers, waur offers;
     But thought I might hae waur offers.

     But what wad ye think?—in a fortnight or less—
     The deil tak his taste to gae near her!
     He up the Gate-slack to my black cousin, Bess—
     Guess ye how, the jad! I could bear her, could bear her;
     Guess ye how, the jad! I could bear her.

     But a' the niest week, as I petted wi' care,
     I gaed to the tryst o' Dalgarnock;
     But wha but my fine fickle wooer was there,
     I glowr'd as I'd seen a warlock, a warlock,
     I glowr'd as I'd seen a warlock.

     But owre my left shouther I gae him a blink,
     Lest neibours might say I was saucy;
     My wooer he caper'd as he'd been in drink,
     And vow'd I was his dear lassie, dear lassie,
     And vow'd I was his dear lassie.

     I spier'd for my cousin fu' couthy and sweet,
     Gin she had recover'd her hearin',
     And how her new shoon fit her auld schachl't feet,
     But heavens! how he fell a swearin, a swearin,
     But heavens! how he fell a swearin.

     He begged, for gudesake, I wad be his wife,
     Or else I wad kill him wi' sorrow;
     So e'en to preserve the poor body in life,
     I think I maun wed him to-morrow, to-morrow;
     I think I maun wed him to-morrow.

      Song Inscribed To Alexander Cunningham
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Now spring has clad the grove in green,
     And strew'd the lea wi' flowers;
     The furrow'd, waving corn is seen
     Rejoice in fostering showers.
     While ilka thing in nature join
     Their sorrows to forego,
     O why thus all alone are mine
     The weary steps o' woe!

     The trout in yonder wimpling burn
     That glides, a silver dart,
     And, safe beneath the shady thorn,
     Defies the angler's art—
     My life was ance that careless stream,
     That wanton trout was I;
     But Love, wi' unrelenting beam,
     Has scorch'd my fountains dry.

     That little floweret's peaceful lot,
     In yonder cliff that grows,
     Which, save the linnet's flight, I wot,
     Nae ruder visit knows,
     Was mine, till Love has o'er me past,
     And blighted a' my bloom;
     And now, beneath the withering blast,
     My youth and joy consume.

     The waken'd lav'rock warbling springs,
     And climbs the early sky,
     Winnowing blythe his dewy wings
     In morning's rosy eye;
     As little reck'd I sorrow's power,
     Until the flowery snare
     O'witching Love, in luckless hour,
     Made me the thrall o' care.

     O had my fate been Greenland snows,
     Or Afric's burning zone,
     Wi'man and nature leagued my foes,
     So Peggy ne'er I'd known!
     The wretch whose doom is “Hope nae mair”
      What tongue his woes can tell;
     Within whase bosom, save Despair,
     Nae kinder spirits dwell.

      Inscription

      Written on the blank leaf of a copy of the last edition of my poems,
      presented to the Lady whom, in so many fictitious reveries of passion, but
      with the most ardent sentiments of real friendship, I have so often sung
      under the name of—“Chloris.”^1
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     'Tis Friendship's pledge, my young, fair Friend,
     Nor thou the gift refuse,
     Nor with unwilling ear attend
     The moralising Muse.

     Since thou, in all thy youth and charms,
     Must bid the world adieu,
     (A world 'gainst Peace in constant arms)
     To join the Friendly Few.

     Since, thy gay morn of life o'ercast,
     Chill came the tempest's lour;
     (And ne'er Misfortune's eastern blast
     Did nip a fairer flower.)

     Since life's gay scenes must charm no more,
     Still much is left behind,
     Still nobler wealth hast thou in store—
     The comforts of the mind!

     Thine is the self-approving glow,
     Of conscious Honour's part;
     And (dearest gift of Heaven below)
     Thine Friendship's truest heart.

     The joys refin'd of Sense and Taste,
     With every Muse to rove:
     And doubly were the Poet blest,
     These joys could he improve.
     R.B.

     But by that health, I've got a share o't,
     But by that life, I'm promis'd mair o't,
     My hale and wee, I'll tak a care o't,

      The Dean Of Faculty
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     A New Ballad
     Tune—“The Dragon of Wantley.”
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     Dire was the hate at old Harlaw,
     That Scot to Scot did carry;
     And dire the discord Langside saw
     For beauteous, hapless Mary:
     But Scot to Scot ne'er met so hot,
     Or were more in fury seen, Sir,
     Than 'twixt Hal and Bob for the famous job,
     Who should be the Faculty's Dean, Sir.

     This Hal for genius, wit and lore,
     Among the first was number'd;
     But pious Bob, 'mid learning's store,
     Commandment the tenth remember'd:
     Yet simple Bob the victory got,
     And wan his heart's desire,
     Which shews that heaven can boil the pot,
     Tho' the devil piss in the fire.

     Squire Hal, besides, had in this case
     Pretensions rather brassy;
     For talents, to deserve a place,
     Are qualifications saucy.
     So their worships of the Faculty,
     Quite sick of merit's rudeness,
     Chose one who should owe it all, d'ye see,
     To their gratis grace and goodness.

     As once on Pisgah purg'd was the sight
     Of a son of Circumcision,
     So may be, on this Pisgah height,
     Bob's purblind mental vision—
     Nay, Bobby's mouth may be opened yet,
     Till for eloquence you hail him,
     And swear that he has the angel met
     That met the ass of Balaam.

     In your heretic sins may you live and die,
     Ye heretic Eight-and-Tairty!
     But accept, ye sublime Majority,
     My congratulations hearty.
     With your honours, as with a certain king,
     In your servants this is striking,
     The more incapacity they bring,
     The more they're to your liking.

      Epistle To Colonel De Peyster
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     My honor'd Colonel, deep I feel
     Your interest in the Poet's weal;
     Ah! now sma' heart hae I to speel
     The steep Parnassus,
     Surrounded thus by bolus pill,
     And potion glasses.

     O what a canty world were it,
     Would pain and care and sickness spare it;
     And Fortune favour worth and merit
     As they deserve;
     And aye rowth o' roast-beef and claret,
     Syne, wha wad starve?

     Dame Life, tho' fiction out may trick her,
     And in paste gems and frippery deck her;
     Oh! flickering, feeble, and unsicker
     I've found her still,
     Aye wavering like the willow-wicker,
     'Tween good and ill.

     Then that curst carmagnole, auld Satan,
     Watches like baudrons by a ratton
     Our sinfu' saul to get a claut on,
     Wi'felon ire;
     Syne, whip! his tail ye'll ne'er cast saut on,
     He's aff like fire.

     Ah Nick! ah Nick! it is na fair,
     First showing us the tempting ware,
     Bright wines, and bonie lasses rare,
     To put us daft
     Syne weave, unseen, thy spider snare
     O hell's damned waft.

     Poor Man, the flie, aft bizzes by,
     And aft, as chance he comes thee nigh,
     Thy damn'd auld elbow yeuks wi'joy
     And hellish pleasure!
     Already in thy fancy's eye,
     Thy sicker treasure.

     Soon, heels o'er gowdie, in he gangs,
     And, like a sheep-head on a tangs,
     Thy girning laugh enjoys his pangs,
     And murdering wrestle,
     As, dangling in the wind, he hangs,
     A gibbet's tassel.

     But lest you think I am uncivil
     To plague you with this draunting drivel,
     Abjuring a' intentions evil,
     I quat my pen,
     The Lord preserve us frae the devil!
     Amen! Amen!

     There's a noble Earl's fame and high renown,
     For an auld sang—it's thought the gudes were stown—
     Buy braw troggin, &amp;c.

     Here's the worth o' Broughton in a needle's e'e;

     Here's an honest conscience might a prince adorn;

     Here's armorial bearings frae the manse o' Urr;

     Here is Satan's picture, like a bizzard gled,

     Not even to view the heavenly choir,
     Would be so blest a sight.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the Foundation”
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
“Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
