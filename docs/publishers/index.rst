For Content Publishers
======================

This section is for **content publishers** who publish content to the web and
want to integrate the Hypothesis client into their web pages. If you want to
add the Hypothesis client to your web pages so that visitors can annotate the
pages without having to install their own Hypothesis browser extension, these
pages will help you get started.
