Architecture Decision Records
=============================

Here you will find documents which describe significant architectural decisions
made or proposed when developing the Hypothesis client. We record these in
order to provide a reference for the history, motivation, and rationale for past
decisions.

See
`the introduction in the h repository <https://github.com/hypothesis/h/blob/master/docs/arch/index.rst>`_
for more details.
