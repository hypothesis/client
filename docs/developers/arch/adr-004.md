# Configurable Sidebar UI placement

This document is about proposing a new optional feature that would allow the client's sidebar user interface to be displayed in a chosen container element within the host page.
In combination with the existing theming capability this could be used to achieve a seamless integration with the UI of the host page.

## Context

The Hypothesis client's main user interface consists of a side bar that slides in/out from the right side of the host document's viewport.

The sidebar has one configuration. It's in a fixed position, spans the full height of the page, and when expanded it is layered on top of the page content.
This is a design that generally works with a wide range of content and host page user interfaces.
However there are some cases where this design is not completely ideal. 
One example is the case where a host page author would prefer the sidebar to not conceal content as it's expanded.
More cases arise when the host page is designed with an existing sidebar. 

The Hypothesis client can be deployed on a website through the use of an embeddable script. This usage allows the client to be configured through various settings. 
The behaviour, branding and theme is customizable. There currently is no configuration to change the sidebar's placement and layout. 

Giving the host page control on where the client UI is contained would allow for better cohesion of both user interfaces. 

## Proposal

- Add a new config option that explicitly declares a DOM element to be the parent of the sidebar's frame element.
    - Let this config be named `hostElementSelector`
    - The value provided is a CSS selector in the context of the host page.
    - The selector must be to a element that exists at the client bootstrap time.
- The default behaviour of the sidebar opening and closing with an animation is to be prevented when the config is used.
    - The sidebar frame is to be fully visible, contained inside the hosting element and be bound to it.
- Ensure `onLayoutChanged` maintains its expected functionality.
    - When the hosting element shrinks or grows in height or width it should emit the appropriate info.
    - When the element has no visible bounds or when the bounds become visible it should emit this.
- Hide the Bucket bar and Toolbar when the config is used.
    - The respective sidebar plugins will be disabled and not loaded.
    - This is a compromise for allowing more control over the sidebar element hosting.
- The detaching or re-attaching of the hosting element is to be left as undefined behaviour.
    - The client-server architecture with the discovery mechanism of the sidebar may allow this to be a non-issue but there could be bugs.
