Developing the Client
=====================

This section documents how to setup a development environment for the client,
how to run the client and its tests in a development environment,
client coding standards and how to contribute code to the client.

Setting up a Client Development Environment
-------------------------------------------

Prerequisites
#############

You will need:

* `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_
* `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_ v6.3+
* `Yarn <https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/>`_

Building
########

To build the client for development:

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone 'https://github.com/hypothesis/client.git'
   cd client
   npm install -g gulp-cli  # Tip: if you get a "permission denied" error try
                            # `sudo npm install -g gulp-cli` instead.
   make

You now have a development client built. To run your development client in
a browser you'll need a local copy of either the Hypothesis Chrome extension or
h. Follow either :ref:`running-from-browser-ext` or
:ref:`running-from-h` below.
If you're only interested in making changes to the client (and not to h)
then running the client from the browser extension is easiest.


.. _running-from-browser-ext:

Running the Client from the Browser Extension
---------------------------------------------

This is the currently easiest way to get your development client running in a
browser. It sets you up to make changes to the client and to the Chrome
extension itself, but not to h.

#. Check out the
   `browser extension <https://github.com/hypothesis/browser-extension>`_
   and follow the steps in the browser extension's documentation to build the
   extension and configure it to use your local version of the client and the
   production Hypothesis service.

#. Start the client's development server to rebuild the client whenever it
   changes:

    .. code-block:: sh

       make dev

#. After making changes to the client, you will need to run ``make`` in the
   browser extension repo and reload the extension in Chrome to see changes.
   You can use
   `Extensions Reloader <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extensions-reloader/fimgfedafeadlieiabdeeaodndnlbhid?hl=en>`_
   to make this easier.

.. _running-from-h:

Running the Client From h
-------------------------

This takes longer to setup than :ref:`running-from-browser-ext`.
You should follow these steps if you want to make changes to h as well as to
the client.

First follow the
`instructions for setting up a development install of h <http://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing/>`_.
Once you have a development install of h set up, you can
configure it to use a local build of the client. **In the client repository**,
run:

.. code-block:: sh

   export SIDEBAR_APP_URL=http://localhost:5000/app.html
   make dev

Next, you'll need to create an OAuth client which enables the Hypothesis client
to request an access token from the service in order to make API calls.

1. Go to http://localhost:5000/admin/oauthclients (you'll need to be logged
   in to h as an admin user)
2. Select "Register a new OAuth client"
3. Choose a name (eg. "Client") and set the redirect URL to
   http://localhost:5000/app.html. Leave the other settings at their default values.
4. After creating the client, make a note of the randomly generated client ID.

**In the `hypothesis/h` repository**, set the :envvar:`CLIENT_URL` and
:envvar:`CLIENT_OAUTH_ID` env vars to tell h where to load the client from and
what OAuth client to use, before running ``make dev``:

.. code-block:: sh

   export CLIENT_OAUTH_ID={ OAuth client ID from step above }
   export CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3001/hypothesis
   make dev

Once the client and h are running, you can test it out by visiting:
http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:5000/docs/help in your browser.

You can also load the client into your own web pages by adding:

.. code-block:: html

   <script async src="http://localhost:5000/embed.js"></script>

to the page's HTML. Note that this will only work in pages served via plain
HTTP.  If you want to test out the client on pages served via HTTPS then building
the client into a browser extension is the easiest option.

Running the Tests
-----------------

Hypothesis uses Karma and mocha for testing. To run all the tests once, run:

.. code-block:: sh

   make test

To run tests and automatically re-run them whenever any source files change, run:

.. code-block:: sh

   gulp test-watch

You can filter the tests which are run by running ``make test FILTER=<pattern>``.
See the documentation for Mocha's
`grep <https://mochajs.org/#g---grep-pattern>`_ option.

Code Style
----------

JavaScript
##########

Hypothesis uses ESLint_ (a linter) and Prettier_ (an automated code formatter)
to ensure style consistency and help prevent common mistakes. Plugins are
available for most editors for these tools. We recommend that you set these up
before making changes to the code.

To auto-format code and run lint checks locally using the CLI, run:

.. code-block:: sh

   make format
   make lint

.. _ESLint: https://eslint.org
.. _Prettier: https://prettier.io

CSS
###

Styling is authored in SASS. For guidance on writing CSS for Hypothesis
projects, please see our
