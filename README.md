documents. It is used by the [Hypothesis browser extension][ext], and can also
be [embedded directly on web pages][embed].

Development
-----------

We'll soon be adding instructions on how to set up a development environment for
the Hypothesis client.

If you are already clear on the difference between this repository and the
[`hypothesis/h`](https://github.com/hypothesis/h) repository then in the mean
time the [Contributor's Guide](https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing/)
may be of use. Be aware that many instructions in that guide do not apply to
this repository.
