usage: exorcist map_file [options]

  Externalizes the source map of the file streamed in.

  The source map is written as JSON to map_file, and the original file is streamed out with its
  sourceMappingURL set to the path of map_file (or to the value of the --url option).

OPTIONS:

  --base -b   Base path for calculating relative source paths. (default: use absolute paths)
  --root -r   Root URL for loading relative source paths. Set as sourceRoot in the source map. (default: '')
  --url  -u   Full URL to source map. Set as sourceMappingURL in the output stream. (default: map_file)

EXAMPLE:

  Bundle main.js with browserify into bundle.js and externalize the map to bundle.js.map.

    browserify main.js --debug | exorcist bundle.js.map > bundle.js
