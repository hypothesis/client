### v0.3.0: August 6, 2013
 * _Breaking change_: Removed `pluralize()` method; instead, just use the `t()` method, passing in a `smart_count` option.
 * _Breaking change_: Removed the ability to use `Array`, `Backbone.Collection`, etc. instances for the `smart_count` option; instead, must pass a `Number`.
 * Allow passing `Number` as second argument to `t()`, which gets converted to the options object `{smart_count: <my number>}`.

 * Added `allowMissing` option to let the phrase key be the default translation (thanks @ziad-saab).

### v0.2.0: Dec 20, 2012
 * _Breaking change_: Moved from Singleton pattern to class-based. Now you create an instance of the `Polyglot` class rather than using class methods directly on it. The reason is to allow maintaining multiple sets of phrases, which is something we ran into at Airbnb with a highly-concurrent Express app.
 * _Breaking change_: Removed the built-in Handlebars helpers, because Handlebars is a singleton, and it's messy to create a single helper function that can be bound to different Polyglot instances.  Instead, it's super easy to create your own, based on your requirements.
