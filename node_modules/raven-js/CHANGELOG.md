## 1.1.8

* Fixed a bug in IE8. See: https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js/pull/179

These were a bunch of super small incremental updates trying to get better integration and better support inside Sentry itself.

* Culprit determined from the src url of the offending script, not the url of the page.

## 1.1.2

* An invalid DSN will now raise a RavenConfigError instead of some cryptic error

* https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js/issues/128

## 1.1.1

* Fixed a bug in parsing some DSNs. See: https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js/issues/160

## 1.1.0

### Plugins
If you're upgrading from 1.0.x, 2 "plugins" were included with the package. These 2 plugins are now stripped out of core and included as the `jquery` and `native` plugins. If you'd like to start using 1.1.0 and maintain existing functionality, you'll want to use: http://cdn.ravenjs.com/1.1.0/jquery,native/raven.min.js For a list of other plugins, checkout http://ravenjs.com

### ravenjs.com
A new website dedicated to helping you compile a custom build of raven.js

### whitelistUrls
`whitelistUrls` are recommended over `ignoreUrls`. `whitelistUrls` drastically helps cut out noisy error messages from other scripts running on your site.

### Misc
* `ignoreUrls`, `ignoreErrors`, `includePaths` have all been unified to accept both a regular expression and strings to avoid confusion and backwards compatability
* `Raven.wrap` recursively wraps arguments
* Events are dispatched when an exception is received, recorded or failed sending to Sentry
* Support newer Sentry protocol which allows smaller packets
* Allow loading raven async with RavenConfig
* Entirely new build system with Grunt
* `options.collectWindowErrors` to tell Raven to ignore window.onerror
