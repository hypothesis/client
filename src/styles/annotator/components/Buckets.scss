/**
 * These classes style buttons to appear as lozenges with an integrated arrow
 * pointing left, up or down (right doesn't exist yet but could easily be added).
 * *
 * The arrow-points are created by the combination of borders and positioning.

  // down or left. On its own, it will be lozenge-shaped. Compose with one

  // `classname="BucketButton LeftBucketButton`

  // These buttons use absolute units for sizing, fonts, border-radius. This is
  // purposeful: they should not scale with root-font scaling in the host page.
  // This is to make sure they still properly align with the sidebar UI.

  // These will still properly scale if the user zooms the font in the browser.
