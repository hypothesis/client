# Icon Fonts

The icon fonts for H were created with [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app). The source file which contains the SVG definitions of the icons is `fonts/selection.json`.

The icons used are from the _Icomoon Free_ and [_Material Icons_](https://www.google.com/design/icons/) libraries which are both pre-installed in the icomoon app.

## Adding New Icons

To add new icons, you'll need to load `selection.json` into the icomoon app,
add the relevant icons and then use the app's _Generate Font_ facility.

 1. Go to the [icomoon app](https://icomoon.io/app) and import `selection.json`
    as a new project.
 2. Search for icons or import the ones you want to add from another source and
    add them to the 'h' set.
 3. Select the 'Edit' tool, click on the new icon and enter a name for use in the generated
    `h-icon-<name>` class name.
 4. Ensure all icons in the 'h' set are selected, then go to the 'Generate Font' tab in icomoon
    and click the 'Download' button which appears _within_ the tab.
 5. Run `scripts/update-icon-font.py <icomoon zip archive>` to update the icon font
 6. Commit the updated files to the repository.

## Updating or removing icons

To update or remove icons, follow the initial steps for adding icons above, but
instead of adding an icon use the Icomoon UI tools to edit icons in the set or
remove them before exporting the updated font and running the
`update-icon-font.py` script.
