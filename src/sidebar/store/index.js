/**
 * AnnotationUI is the central store of state for the sidebar application,
 * managed using [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).
 *
 * State management in Redux apps work as follows:
 *
 *  1. All important application state is stored in a single, immutable object.
 *  2. The user interface is a presentation of this state. Interaction with the
 *     UI triggers updates by creating `actions`.
 *  3. Actions are plain JS objects which describe some event that happened in
 *     the application. Updates happen by passing actions to a `reducer`
 *     function which takes the current application state, the action and
 *     returns the new application state.
 *
 *     The process of updating the app state using an action is known as
 *     'dispatching' the action.
 *  4. Other parts of the app can subscribe to changes in the app state.
 *     This is used to to update the UI etc.
 *
 * "middleware" functions can wrap the dispatch process in order to implement
 *  logging, trigger side effects etc.
 *
 * Tests for a given action consist of:
 *
 *  1. Checking that the UI (or other event source) dispatches the correct
 *     action when something happens.
 *  2. Checking that given an initial state, and an action, a reducer returns
 *     the correct resulting state.
 *  3. Checking that the UI correctly presents a given state.
