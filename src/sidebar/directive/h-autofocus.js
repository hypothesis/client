/** An attribute directive that focuses an <input> when it's linked by Angular.
 *
 * The HTML5 autofocus attribute automatically puts the keyboard focus in an
 * <input> on page load. But this doesn't work for <input>s that are
 * rendered by JavaScript/Angular after page load, for example an <input> that
 * is shown/hidden by JavaScript when an ng-if condition becomes true.
 *
 * To automatically put the keyboard focus on such an input when it's linked by
 * Angular, attach this directive to it as an attribute:
 *
 *   <input ng-if="..." h-autofocus>
 *
