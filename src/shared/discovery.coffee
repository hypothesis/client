# A module for establishing connections between multiple frames in the same
# document. This model requires one frame (and only one) to be designated the
# server (created with options.server: true) which can then connect to as
# many clients as required. Once a handshake between two frames has been
# completed the onDiscovery callback will be called with information about
# both frames.
#
# Example:
#
#   // host.html
#   var server = new Discovery(window, {server: true})
#   server.startDiscovery(function (window, source, token) {
#     // Establish a message bus to the new client window.
#     server.stopDiscovery();
#   }
#
#   // client.html
#   var client = new Discovery(window)
#   client.startDiscovery(function (window, source, token) {
#     // Establish a message bus to the new server window.
#     server.stopDiscovery();
#   }
